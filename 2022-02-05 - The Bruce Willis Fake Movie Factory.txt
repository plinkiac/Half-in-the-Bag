half in the bag why are you wasting my time just kill me
sir i already told you he's about five foot one 200-ish pounds he wears
sunglasses some kind of [ __ ] golf cap he walks around with a cane he wears really ugly mismatched clothing he
smells what yes i understand that that's what everybody who goes to the casino looks
like well how could you miss him he's mr [ __ ] blanket
he's a goddamn legend in this town for christ's sakes
can you look at your security footage or something
well double dumbass on youtube
i said why did you take off your mask did you find mr plinkett no and i looked
everywhere where did you look well from the pharmacy i followed a series of wacky clues that led me from one
comically overcrowded venue to the next a fish fry a ballroom dancing class for
the elderly an overcrowded sauna bingo hall and finally i found out that
he got accidentally invited to a very crowded office christmas party and that's where the trail went
cold what oh my god i decided to stay at the christmas party
you know just in case mr plinkett showed up but then i got wasted and i put my balls on
the copy machine and then i threw up in a paper shredder it's all on instagram and tick tock if
you want to see no jay i don't want to see and quite frankly i'm [ __ ] disappointed in you your job was to find
mr plinkett and you failed and who the [ __ ] has an office christmas party in february
kova delay oh right covet delay delayed yeah because of kovalev cove it delayed like it was
supposed to be obviously in december it was a cro office christmas party is so supposed to be somewhere but the kovitz
spiked and they delayed it until february february why why is february okay well it was a christmas party but
it was difficult they got a christmas uh of saint patrick's day well they actually had that in december
the st patrick's a parade party [ __ ] coveted that was the cove delay from the year before oh right red right
right right so everything's out of whack because of covid delays yeah what the so fourth of july is in october now and now
fourth of july is still unfortunate i'm still celebrating fourth of july from 2020 next month i don't even know what
holidays are was that because of a kova delay of course delayed yeah i haven't had my 54th birthday yet
i had a great plan if he showed up too i was gonna spike his drink with a date rape drug and then wheel him back to the
house where the hell did you get a date rape drug so this one time when i met bill cosby
oh forget it i don't wanna know oh no i got the roof and all from a
dealer on the street i was just gonna tell you an amusing anecdote about the time i met bill cosby what why would you
start telling me some random story about a time you met a celebrity we're in the middle of a crisis jay
i don't know to lighten the mood it's actually a really funny story if you want to hear it sometime
well it was a funny story
what the [ __ ] is that that's the upstairs tenant i rented out mr plinkett's spare bedroom all the guy
does is watch sitcoms all day
turn it down shut the [ __ ] up
no one thinks webster is funny sorry about it
so do you think all these masks and [ __ ] will protect us from the whatever variant
of course they will jay everything helps plus we're triple vaxxed and boostered
also the other day i went around to 12 different pharmacies and clinics and got
boostered again and again and again 12 times all in the same day
i was throwing up blood for six hours but i am [ __ ] protected against covin
my blood is 75 vaccine now i can't see out of my right eye but that's okay i'm
not gonna get omnicron jesus christ mike calm down they say that the omicron
variant is starting to burn itself out what well how could that be
shouldn't there be another variant that's even stronger and then another variant and then
another one one after the other that gets stronger and stronger
but i don't want it to end jay more variance more variance endless
[ __ ] variance endless endless j i i i just want i want this forever i want it
i want it forever jay i i don't know how to tell you this and then i'm sorry i'm sorry
it's just that this pandemic has been going on for so long i don't know how to live
any other way
hey [ __ ] turn it down
uh mr plinkett where have you been well not that it's any of your business but it's at the casino
the pharmacy a fish fry then i went to my ballroom dancing class
uh the sauna oh and then i accidentally got an evite to an office christmas party i must have
sent it to the wrong email but i went anyway you know for the cold
food and the hot sex it was a wild party some lady was
xeroxing her balls in the coffee machine why would you say it was a lady if she
had balls jay i just joined the twitter and i learned
it's not okay to assign gender to anybody she was a pretty little lady with a
beard i'm sure it was a man and you're assigning gender by saying it was a lady
get woke bro you guys this is the stupidest conversation ever mr plinkett what happened with your
covid oh yeah no i wasn't got a test i had the omicron variant yeah but just felt like
a mild cold and then i got better but but i thought you had the dreaded omega
variant you know the thing that i made up inside my own head
a mega variant what the [ __ ] is that but mike you should be happy there is no omega variant the pandemic is slowly
burning itself out [ __ ] finally but jay our plan
we were going to knock mr plinkett unconscious with a bowling trophy then slit his wrists and drain out all of his
blood into 12 different buckets and then pour his blood into used coffee filters
you know to strain out those precious omega variant antibodies and then make our own vaccine in a
margarita mixer then we take that vaccine and march right up to the front door of the white
house wearing clown costumes and sell that vaccine to joe biden and then
they'd award us the medal of freedom mike i think it's time to admit that this scam is over and like all of our
scams it didn't end with us being rich or powerful
oh hey hey guys uh you want to watch a movie huh huh i i just picked this up from the red box
remember red box they have one at my bingo hall it's for people who don't know what an internet
is this is the new bruce willis movie which one
apex american siege out of death hard kill
cosmic sin midnight in the switch grass survive the night survive the game deadlock
breach fortress which one which movie is it oh
look guys this whole conversation has made me tired i need to go take a nap
well mike what do you say we fire up the 127 inch tv and see what bruce willis
has been up to
hey i thought you were dead get out it's time to get up you could
hey mike seen any bruce willis movies lately in fact jay i have we just watched
several of them on mr plinkett's big screen tv really taking advantage of that that giant television i know
watching these these carefully crafted films they're they're works of fart
why did we do this mike well for years we've noticed films in the red
box on demand uh with with a with an aging movie star
on the cover all look like junk movies and we always call them redbox movies
and we laugh at them and we never really knew we always suspected they were made
you know abroad foreign countries you know like cheaply we didn't really know much about them
yeah there's movies that appear you never see trailers for them there's never nobody ever talks about them or
reviews them no they just show up in that crappy little red box right or or
you know amazon prime or voodoo or whatever like the on-demand service and you say hey this has a famous person in
it how have i never even heard of it exactly and and they're not you know
they're they're famous people that are kind of they're fading stars yeah um but they're
still names you're you're john travoltas yes nicholas cage keeps bouncing back and forth between these and good movies
thank god he he takes a good script every now and then but yes you're you're nicholas cage robert de niro al pacino
bruce willis bruce willis is the the biggest criminal of them all
uh well that's that we've talked in previous half in the bags and the most recent half in the bag we mentioned the
the never-ending pile of bruce willis movies and so we said hey let's dive
into those what are these where did they come from then somehow i saw an article on the internet it was on
vulture.com an article by a guy named joshua hart from may of 2021 and it was
called the the king of the the geezer teaser which is which is the name for these
types of movies where they have an old male action star actor as
as the pole yeah and and who's barely in the movie and it was called the king of the geezer
teasers and so that was kind of the genesis of of this discussion and diving into these bruce
willis films because bruce willis has made eleven films in the last two years
uh and that's walked in front of the camera for 11 films exclusively and i'm not i'm not like there isn't like an art
film or like a like a tv appearance in it and this it's specifically only
11 films and they're all trash and we're gonna get go go through those
all of them yeah i think the original idea for this was like ah we'll make fun of these crappy bruce willis movies
because you've heard about like oh he uses body doubles he barely acts keep working old man
i'll take you anytime punk and so that was kind of i was going into it like that like oh this will be fun to make
fun of but most of them are too pathetic to be funny bad and it led to a much larger discovery of
this this factory this exploitation factory yes that is going on that is
completely under the radar because nobody watches these things somebody must they get made
they get bought for distribution and then nobody watches them
uh a good business model would collapse if nobody watched them that's what i say
they get i'm sure they get paid you know uh cosmic sin is one of them that's on netflix right now once upon a time
you're a big bad [ __ ] but now but
there are places everywhere where they could stream and they have an audience and it says it was uh the article said
it was mainly men over the age of 35 35 to like 60.
that's their demographic because no one under 35 gives a [ __ ] about bruce willis right it's probably even older than 35.
um probably guys in their 50s well people that still rent dvds from redbox
yeah it's redbox and it's streaming but so before we dive into the movies that which is the fun and interesting part uh
we want to credit the article make sure you go read it um it it is it is about this guy
named randall emmett he is the king of the geezer teasers
can we call him the geezer sleazers i think that's funny these are sleazers sure geezer exploitation yeah
elderly abuse whatever you want to call them well this guy uh he
he started out as um i think he was an intern for like jerry
bruckheimer productions but then he was mark wahlberg's personal assistant and
he's the inspiration for the character turtle on entourage okay a show i've never really watched but i know that i
think i've seen one episode of it and didn't like it this guy another guy they talk about the canon group uh canon=
films like how they kind of started the model of doing the cheap i i wanted to compare this company to canon and to roger
corman but we'll get there yeah um and and interestingly enough the the one movie that kind of kicked off
this whole thing was the expendables oh that makes sense you remember watching that and you're like
something's really cheap and bad about this and i don't quite know what it is this doesn't feel like a real movie but
it was in the theaters i'm assuming that they probably have a formula where all the budgets are kind of the same maybe a
little bit more for a sci-fi movie than like a gritty cop movie um but i mean they're not putting any money
even in the cop movies they're not putting any money into the facts squibs anything like that it's all plug-ins
right uh which going back to the expendables that's what i remember about that movie yeah they were promoting it as like it's a return to gritty 80s
action and it was a big lie because every every uh squib is just a digital
uh plug
there's something that felt off about expendables i was like this is a great concept all these washed up 80s 90s
action stars all together in one big movie what a great thing i remember being confused by that one too because
it was directed by stallone and i liked the couple movies he directed before that he did rocky balboa
and he directed uh the fourth rambo movie and i actually like his directing
in those so it's like oh he's doing the expendables and then i started watching it and it felt like every shot it felt
like the actor was shot in a different time in a different location this is like the precursor to these these uh
bruce willis movies and so there's there's a handful of players there's you know this guy randall emmett has
produced uh he has a movie credit as a producer for 110 films oh my god his movies have
grossed more than 1.2 billion dollars so the model is he accepts money from
anyone who's willing to offer it most of the money goes to an aging star
like bruce willis etc um they use that actor's name to pre-sell
the movie even before it's done to foreign markets to help pay the rest shooting locations where
the tax credits are the best i.e not in the u.s probably i a lot of
the ones i watched were uh shot in georgia georgia has a lot of productions there yeah um or canada or yeah i have i
think apex was canada right there's those like actors that you always recognize oh sure and i was like that's
canadian actor this is john canada yeah and so uh movies shot in two weeks or less
so basically like yeah if you watch one of these movies there's like and we're gonna do a super cut here too to show
you there's there's a million different like logos in the front probably people who put up money or that was my very
first note when i started watching my very first film from this this group was there are so many opening company logos
yeah that was before apex i started laughing out loud because they just kept going venture capital yeah
and so everyone wants a piece of this they'll throw money in and then
most of the movies are shot in two weeks or less two weeks
two weeks bruce willis gets ninety percent of the
budget and then and does zero percent of the work they do they make the movie as
cheaply and as quickly as possible and make a poster and dump it and then and then move on then it probably ekes out a
small profit and then they move on and and so it's um it is a factory it's it's an assembly line like i said
it turns the art of filmmaking into just a despicable
disgusting product well that's that's why i wanted to compare him to roger corman because roger corman notoriously
cheap made tons of low-budget movies lots of them were rip-offs of bigger budget movies or star wars or jaws or
whatever but roger corman was smart enough to hire young talented filmmakers
to make the movies fun joe dante make a ripoff of jaws joe dante says can i make
it funny he says sure do whatever i thought i told you not even to say that word
what about the goddamn piranhas they're eating the guests sir or they fill their their they use their budget not on aging
stars but on car stunts or or spaceship special effects and they make the movies
fun these movies are joyless slogs and they're they're so cheap and so
poorly made and they they they do hire young uh directors
uh one of the the the prime suspects in this whole operation is edward drake i watched
edward john drake i watched a few movies by him one of the worst [ __ ] filmmakers
ever i did see an interview with him he seems like a decent enough guy it's like this young british man
he just seems to be like happy to have the opportunity but holy [ __ ]
which one did he direct uh he did apex oh wait i know this because because i uh
i wrote i i went and i went i made a spreadsheet and i i linked all of these characters
all of our players yeah edward drake directed three a guy named james cullen bresek directed
two uh matt s kendari directed two
and then three uh the other four well there's 11 bruce willis films that came on the last two
years and this is all he's done in two years is junk films yeah the la the the anomaly in his latin
the last like five six years of his career i think is glass that was like a real movie yes i mean uh
you know i i i can't speculate on someone's financial situation but you think like
doesn't he have just a ton of money like you know and is he has he blown at all yeah you know what i mean it's none
of our business but the one thing that is certain is that he's not doing it for the love of the craft oh yeah uh it's it's
i i knew that he was doing these cheapo movies or he wasn't putting in any effort and i was still shocked by how
bad he was it's it's like shameful yeah and and it's it's almost like
unless you're desperate it's it would be so demoralizing and embarrassing
hi robert this is a beautiful day today isn't it it sure is
i watched the movie breach we're going to talk about all these movies and it is like
it's bad that's the sci-fi one right yes the sets look just like the space cop
sets they use the exact same pieces of material yes and the and the movies made with like styrofoam sets that are spray
painted can you imagine being bruce willis and
walking onto that set and how like ashamed you'd be at how low of a production it is you know what i
mean like and so unless you have horrible amounts of debt you owe taxes
you blew through all of your money maybe you have to pay like [ __ ] child support got a bunch of kids yeah if
you're unless you're bankrupt why would you do this unless you're just like hey it's super easy work and i get like five
hundred thousand dollars for two days work he gets he gets over a million dollars per movie for maybe two days of
work okay so you do you know four or five of these a year that's all you got to do all year i mean that's
okay okay and then you just like uh gosh a million for one of these movies more
than a million okay i want to say it was like one of the articles i read i want to say it was like 2 million okay then i
i i'm just i i stand back so i think it's that it's laziness of of
just oh i get a bunch of money for doing the barest minimum of effort sure to the
point where i'm not going to memorize my lines did you notice the earpiece no
and we both watched we didn't both watch all of these but we both watched apex
and i noticed in one scene i saw an ear a little thing in his ear and my first thought was oh my god
they're just feeding him his lines so then i did a little bit of research and i discovered something about bruce
willis i didn't know could it be a hearing aid he is like 75 deaf in his left ear
from a gun going off right next to his head when he made the original die hard
well going that far back okay so then i was like oh well you know he's got a hearing hearing aid i'm not
going to make fun of him for that but then i noticed in some shots it was there other shots it wasn't so it's a
continuity issue but that's his left ear and also in apex and other movies he has
a little earpiece in his right ear as well so somebody's feeding him lines
he walks on set someone says into a microphone what he has to say he just says it well then he goes back to his
trailer there's that scene in apex when he's talking to the hologram the the hologram lady who's coordinating
the the hunt kill hunt thing i'm a popular guy how you stayed alive this long is beyond
me the luck of the irish so yeah should we explain the plot of apex real quick
yeah well okay let's we're gonna get into the movie stuff
okay we've we've we've referenced uh the king of the the geezer teaser the stage
is set the stage is set um and you can go into this article because it's crazy
they talk about like the russian mob and all these people want to kill this guy and and uh he he's being sued by this
person and that person and it's just this like completely tangled mess of he's super hated in
hollywood but he makes these movies he he actually um
martin scorsese was having trouble finding money to produce uh uh what's this uh silence
okay yeah yeah that's kind of a not very commercial idea not a commercial movie they talk about this
this concept of like an old like an old-time artistic filmmaker like martin scorsese
and the phrase one for them one for me where he makes like a commercially successful movie and then he's able to
make something like last temptation of christ or silence or canoon or an artsy fartsy movie that's
not going to bring in huge money at the box office but it's something as an artist martin scorsese wants to make
so he had trouble finding money for uh silence and then uh this guy also got a
producer's credit on the irishman a non-union producer credit cause i don't think he's in the producers guild of
america okay and i don't i think most of his movies he he tries to shoot without union
he tries to get around that i mean i'm not like saying exactly what this guy does this is all detailed in the article
and so and so so that's this guy you can read about him great bruce willis i
understand a little more about why he makes these movies because i didn't think it was that big of a of a payday
yeah but that does sound like 98 of the budgets of these movies and you have to have some nerve
to walk onto the set of a trash movie where you're taking 98
of the money and and everyone else around you is either working for free or or peanuts yeah and and i would feel
like a huge piece of dog [ __ ] if i did that doing absolutely nothing doing barely not
anything and everyone else doing tons of work and trying to make make it in the business and you're you're riding that
wave of your name i get it you earned that name but i would still feel like a piece of garbage like making that much
money when someone else is making a hundred dollars to hold the boom mic i would feel crappy yeah i mean you're a
movie star you're the draw but at least put in the tiniest bit of effort into a performance that's related to the
earpiece thing again i found an article from like i think it was 2017 where he was in bruce willis was in a staged
version of stephen king's misery him and laurie metcalf which sidenote i
would like to see that laurie metcalf as annie wilkinson sure sure she'd be great um but i found a bunch of articles that
were criticizing him because it somehow it came out that he was having his lines fed to him and usually like when an
actor goes back to doing like a stage production it's kind of like because they want to you know they work on these big movies and they want to kind of get
that feel of what it's like to be a real performer again why the [ __ ] are you doing it if you're just having someone like tell you your
lines what did he get out of that it's so weird
maybe he made a deal where he got 98 of the ticket sales i don't have no [ __ ]
idea we should get in there save the day
well that would be stupid
apex is we'll go into apex yeah it is wait first oh my god eventually we'll get to apex
yeah we got to tell everybody the names of these movies oh yeah because uh i know so you cannot watch them for
yourself and also i put them in order of their rotten tomatoes scores oh yeah that was
the original idea for this is we were only going to watch a few of them that had zero percent right but it grew into a larger project yes um
uh okay so number one ironic ironically apex i was gonna say that's the most
ironically titled film of all time uh zero percent american siege zero percent
out of death zero percent hard kill zero percent
cosmic sin three percent oh midnight in the switch grass that's gonna be a little bit higher i'm
guessing eight percent okay um that this guy the the the king of the geezer
teaser actually directed okay that's his first film and i think he might have wrote it too co-wrote it okay but he was
i did i didn't watch the whole thing i skimmed through that one and it looked it looked mediocre but it was better put
together than a lot of these i think they tried a little harder on that i think so they only managed to get it up to eight percent
survive the night 14 survive the game 14 oh my god deadlock
uh wasn't not reviewed by anyone but it has a 15 audience score
but it made all of its money in puerto rico i have no idea
breached 20 and fortress tops it out at another 20 wow i'm surprised any of them got into
the double digits yeah so to be fair some of the ones that are zero percent only have like five six
reviews yeah but well let's talk about our first film apex
the one we both saw it's the most dangerous game
with the sci-fi twists and by that i mean there's an opening shot that looks like exactly like the city shot in space
cop if if your movie is being compared to space cop you know you've done something really wrong
this is the worst one that i watched by far i did find out it was made during covid
so the part of the reason it was made the way it was was to have minimal people
but uh talk about bruce willis having his lines fed to him i texted you like halfway through the
movie because you had already watched it i was like is he going to be in a single shot with another actor
and he's there's a couple shots one shot there's there's a couple shots where he's in the frame with probably a
stand-in because i don't think he was in this same shoot with any of the the other actors in the movie but yeah most of the
movie is him leaning against trees in the woods well here's the premise uh neil mcdonough who's a k some kind of
character actor he's been in a lot of things you recognize his face uh i think he was he on star trek he's
probably in star trek he's probably in some star trek
he's an example of of a pro a professional actor he's working on
this cheapo [ __ ] movie but he's still trying to put in a performance he's pretty good yeah it it
it's in the future they have holographic computer screens that are added later
and posts cheaply so it's the future my favorite piece of future technology
is the fireplace which is just a normal fireplace but there's just like a red glow coming from
it because it's the future oh god um but um and so a cast of unlikable
lovable characters who all or a bunch of fat white guys and some girl
i'll go to this island to kill the ultimate prey which is bruce willis who is in prison
for life and a hologram lets him out uh that opening scene with him in the prison cell with the holograms sets you
up for everything you can tell they just pointed a camera at him and they said say this line
now say this lie yes hey buddy are you lost
holy hell sir how are you still alive come closer and i'll show you
enjoy the rest of your day you're coming on a little strong maybe you could settle down and visit
the grandkids great kids i don't have any grandkids so yeah you can literally feel the cuts
and what he's saying it's like he doesn't even know the context of what oh yeah no i mean especially to learn that
he's having his lines fed to him through his ear yeah he's just saying words yeah he's literally just saying words
okay oh man well the premise is yeah they're chasing
bruce willis through the woods to hunt him first i guess for sport is there any mention of money or anything i think it's just for sport yeah yeah um they
they pay money to do it but bruce willis he's so clever that he puts it in their minds in one line of dialogue he says
hey can the hunters kill each other and the hunters are like oh we've never thought of that hey i got a question
you're coming through loud and clear to all can hunters kill other hunters
and then they just kill each other in the woods through the rest of the movie while bruce willis looks through a bush
well they let bruce willis out of his little room right this is this made me laugh out loud it's like this
what appears to be like a tropical island yeah and they cut and they're like okay bruce willis go we'll give you
30 minutes head start why does that even matter yeah he doesn't set traps he doesn't do
anything clever he just stands behind a tree so that so there's some a stand-in who's running like on a golf course and it's
over the bottom behind the shoulder shot well that's and then it cuts and we don't see bruce willis again for an hour
that's the main staple to point out in all these movies is the body double uh whenever it's not bruce willis's face
it's some other guy
prepare to die skeleton uh in american siege there's a part when
he's running up to a guy to shoot him and the the guy he's running up to shoot is in the foreground so i guess they figured hey the body
double his face he's facing the camera but he's out of focus and this is a gritty action movie so shaky cam so
maybe people won't notice it's not bruce willis but they do but i noticed oh i noticed there is literally no reason for
all the hunters to kill each other it's just one it's like one scene after the other there's two hunters that that
have a long conversation about nonsense you killed your wife bro so you can save
me the sanctimonious oh i'm here to better myself [ __ ] and you can put that down
these people just talk to each other they argue about something and then they kill each other and and bruce willis has
nothing to do with any of it no no other than asking the question in the beginning he just kind of stands there
behind a tree and and peeks out occasionally and literally
does nothing there's a montage of him doing nothing it's so weird they play this like pepe music for no reason and
he just like it just holds on him walking around eating berries
yeah they they say it's like oh pretty soon you're going to start tripping yeah you're about to trip some serious bulls
it doesn't bother me as if that's going to be like something that is a detriment during the climax
but then it isn't it just kind of happens and then goes away and then it goes away and then the movie continues
it has nothing to do with anything and that's the that's the that's the phrase of the day
i suppose it's just wasting time it's just filling time oh yeah nonsense characters talking
about nothing cutting to bruce will like str spreading out his screen time you're just standing behind a tree
i remember thinking like oh is bruce willis ever gonna actually fight anybody in this whole movie and there's one shot
where i think he runs up and he hits the gun out of his hand yeah and it did that shot didn't look like a composite shot
or something so i think that was like they're like we're making an action movie where you're being hunted on an
island we gotta put you in the frame with somebody at some point you've gotta you've gotta fight someone or people are
gonna complain that there isn't even one interaction between you and anybody else
in the whole so all right fine one thing one thing where i knock a gun out of some guy's hand yeah
it's like a such a far cry from like die hard it's like like amazing yeah my brain can't
handle it
well there's a there's a scene in this and i i think it's supposed to be like the end of the the day and the beginning of the
next but bruce willis falls asleep on camera it's like 45 minutes into the movie and
he just goes this is the close-up of him yeah and then i i literally thought he fell asleep on camera and then um then it
cuts to like th and it's like the next day yeah cuz the black and he opens his eyes and it's like the same exact
lighting they shot it like a minute later and i was like oh oh he was his character was actually getting sleepy
and he fell asleep they didn't do a scene where he like climbs up in a tree and finds like a secret spot to sleep for the night and
you know makes or makes a bed like under the ground yeah like it does like
it's the bare minimum oh my god the bare minimum for what can pass for a
movie is that before after he finds a cigar in the middle of the woods yeah a cigar
and a lighter right next to it yeah i guess you could say that was like oh one of the people that got killed on the island probably was because he finds a
skull but oh yeah you should have had it like in the hand of a like a skeleton hand or something
and then he rips it out you're not going to be needing this pal there's a awkward moment where yeah he
he and again i just picture in my head him going i want to smoke a cigar in the movie yeah i brought this girl cigar to
the side and [ __ ] smoke and everyone's like uh sure i guess so um and i
i want to say he's he probably told the camera guy or the director like watch me blow smoke rings
and then he tried and it didn't work he couldn't do it anymore and then they just left it in the movie
uh yeah they got to use every frame of footage they have of them oh and there's also the scene with the mongrels do you
remember that oh my god all of our main uh hunters have been killed and they're like i guess we need more action in this
movie west i'd like to buy five mongrels please
so so neil mcdonough calls up mongrels which i guess are just like
low-level hunters that all beam to the island and bruce willis body double just shoots them one after the other
with no effort and there's nothing clever about it no it's just a montage of bruce willis from the neck down
shooting people neal mcdonald is the head bad guy he's a doctor he collects severed heads as trophies right why is
the trophy room in the the house why would it not be in his own personal house that's a very good
question but he puts the the the head into it's like a glowing doorway that's
supposed to be like i guess a transporter where he puts it in this transporter and then it shows up in his trophy case that is for some reason in
the apex house yes but uh you can tell it's just a doorway to the house because
it still has the door hinges on it you know you pop out the pin and you take off the door but the hinge is still
attached to the frame and he just sticks the head in there i don't know
but neil mcdonough is the apex apex uh man he's the bad guy the big bad guy
uh and so he's for no reason he's the one that has to have the confrontation with bruce willis bruce willis says i'm
hungry hey you got anything real that i can eat i'm starving and so he goes there like
the craft service table is inside that's why he's in the house at the end because he wanted food there's a table of food
and he goes up to the table of food and um which uh i don't know why they
let i can't remember but they have their confrontation and they are green screened in
mr malone
[ __ ] well bruce willis says i don't think the uh neil mcdonough is i know
the the green screen didn't quite look convincing so they just color corrected the scene to be like all red or blue
it's bathed in red i guess from the future fireplace future science fiction something something
something is a way to try and conceal the bad key effects it was but very clearly can you imagine if the climax of
die hard was bruce willis just green screened in looks like an snl sketch or something
did you rehearse that and they didn't even fight no they fired two guns at each other
a one with like a bullet like an explosive giant bullet and they hit each other
and then bruce wells leaves he just walks does it go like this he's like
and and i just don't you just you can see him
just like stumbling out there and just going what do i do i don't know you walk in between those glowing rods and it's
going to beam me away what do i do i don't i don't just oh and it goes like this and then the movie ends and it just fades to credits
it's it's so bad and i want to tell you a little something after every one of these i
watched i watched two yeah uh i rated them five stars on vudu
so that others may be tricked into into watching these it's like the ring you have to get other people to
watch it for your own survival yes
well that's not how i do things it's like watching just some employee at their job just
doing the bare minimum who has no effort he's like he's like the fast food worker
of actors you know what i mean yeah but they just don't care at all well i think he's probably hoping at
this point that eventually he will get paid to not even have to act should we bring up the russian
commercial oh sure this is a good time zenny i guess he got paid millions of dollars for his likeness for a deep fake
i don't know yeah vodka or some kind of alcoholic beverage i watched it it's him and another guy like
tied up it's like an action movie looking thing right but yeah he he got paid
for the commercial without literally having to do anything yeah it's just a deep fake he wasn't even there it's like
can you just [ __ ] scan my head in now and just you know he would he would be the first to sign up for that yeah the
there's a really good movie about that called the congress with uh robin wright's in it and that's what it's all about is that scanning an actor
and using them forever i think the difference between
between like a crappy worker like a cog in the machine kind of worker who just has no enthusiasm for
their job just hates it isn't helpful just does the bare minimum
to get by to get their paycheck the difference between that and bruce willis is that
an actor is is an entertainer you know what i mean it's like if you
went and saw like uh who's like who would be a good example of a of an aging like
singer you know share okay share you go you go see sharon concert and and
she just kind of sits in a chair and goes she shows up in sweatpants right she doesn't get dressed up she doesn't do
makeup or hair just shows up in sweatpants and like a like a t-shirt with stains on it sits in a folding
chair and goes if i could turn back time
uh yeah like she doesn't like she doesn't even try to sing yeah she just like maybe talks
because she knows she's gonna get paid yeah and so so you go and you pay to see cher
perform and you sit and you're like oh my god she's just wearing sweatpants and she's sitting in a folding chair yeah
and she's she's not even standing up and she's just she's just mumbling the words to her song that's like the
equivalent of what bruce willis is doing in these movies you pay to see this action movie with bruce willis in it and
he's phoning it in as they say
this man he's he's perfect
we'll get out of apex and we'll go to breach uh breach is a as a giant pile of dog
[ __ ] um this is him on a spaceship yeah
i think i saw a clip from it where he's shooting an alien with like a flamethrower yeah and he's putting in no
effort he's just shooting the cg thing and he's like get out of here guys as he shoots them
breach is basically a zombie movie in space okay guy and gal
they the earth's population is like 19 billion people and they're it's about to explode not the earth itself but
everyone's about the earth's [ __ ] everyone's going to die i don't know why there might be a reason
overpopulation uh disease hunger something so that they're all going there's
people who get picked to go on a spaceship to go to the new earth earth two new earth something uh and so
they get on a spaceship made of styrofoam and cardboard and uh the the kid's a stowaway he's the
the admiral or the general or one of like space marines are on it there's 300 000 people on the ship but they're on
cryo except for like 10 people that's very convenient yes and uh uh he he's a stowaway uh the thomas jane
is in it oh i saw him he's wearing like sunglasses he looked pretty cool for the next six months we will blaze across
space and time for most of us in crime this journey will be but a dream
he's in he's in one scene in the beginning he gets put in the cryo freeze and then he shows up at the very end
he's five minutes of screen time he goes from the expanse to a styrofoam space cup sense for a
film shot for 50 bucks is he on the expanse yeah oh good for him um he's getting out of movies like money plane
and breach money plans another one of these [ __ ] movies man you want to bet on a dude [ __ ] an alligator
money plane some saboteur who thinks or all of human humanity
should die brings a worm on board and then the worm uh is like an alien life form that that
transfers to different bodies and turns on everybody into zombies that go home oh god
that's a good way of not having to have a creature throughout the whole movie yeah you just had people go yes exactly
and throughout the whole movie is is the key phrase because at the end a bunch of zombie bodies blow up but
then the creature kind of morphs them all into like like a like a big cgi blob
thing with a mouth that is an ugly [ __ ] hey
[ __ ]
that's what i saw bruce willis shooting at yeah so they have and it's for this movie
it's not bad looking okay surprisingly decent looking um
but the the star of the show is the sets um
they have a little like mess hall set that that i think they they even like show like you know dolly shots of it
when it's empty to show it off wow a handful of scenes in there um but then they just it's like hallways space cop
hallways um and those plastic home depot panels on the walls everything's spray painted
like when they're clo there's a scene where two actors are talking and there's like close-ups and they're sitting against the wall
and you could see where two pieces of styrofoam were butted together to make some kind of weird panel yeah but
weren't quite lined up so it's like a little off-centered and it's like right in the shot and so they're just gluing anything to
the walls yeah like you know when you buy like computer monitor or tv you know that styrofoam
like oh yeah the packaging the framing like [ __ ] glue that to the wall and spray
paint it silver just [ __ ] stick anything on the walls that's great it's so dingy and disgusting and awful
looking they should have gone with like a clean like clean white spaceship look
because it's so grungy looking it's ugly and the whole movie takes place on the spaceship
you idiot well actually bruce willis is in this a lot and he has lots of lines and he's kind of
like laughing and he's he's actually acting in it oh so i'm
going to give credit where credit is due he's actually kind of trying
just christ how do they do that i don't know it's an anomaly that's why it's a 20 percenter that's why i said it's
literally at the top of of the reviews in in this particular cluster of 11
movies uh because he is trying and you know what like as a movie
that's just a piece of garbage it is not that bad okay when you uh
adjust the curve you know well i guess when you compare it to apex apex threw the curve off the
grading curve where apex was so low it brought everything else down so this looks like
you know alien or 2001 a space odyssey well there are
many in watching just looking at the sets and stuff it reminded me of do you remember when we did space jacks with
corbin bernsen yeah the best of the worst yes yes that had really shitty uh shitty spaceship studs
who directed this one do you have that on your nose of course i do oh good i'm gonna assume it's not edward drake
i'm convinced edward drake is the worst filmmaker ever no it's not uh
this is directed directed by john suits wow so
randall emmett the the king of the geezer teasers he wrote uh fortress midnight in the switchgrass
edward drake the worst filmmaker ever he wrote some of these movies that he didn't direct
yes he wrote apex cosmics and he wrote breach and american siege uh but yeah breech uh
some zombie makeup they have a uh they have a like a like a warp core like a
like an engine core that's just a bunch of fluorescent tubes that light up and then
over the course of the production the sign that says like like engine room or warp core is
are you sitting down it's it's a piece of like the quarter
inch foam foam board with like a sticker on it
that someone printed out on their home printer oh okay where it's not even glossy are we sure we didn't work on
this movie we did okay i'm pretty sure but at some point somebody banged into
it and like bent the corner of the foam board and the sticker and so the corner of it looks like all jagged and [ __ ]
up and they have like they have like a that's the sign for the the warp core engine room okay it's made of foam and
it's foam and paper it's not even like plastic it's probably more expensive yeah
so the sets in in their detail are just amazing but to his credit bruce willis
is kind of trying and i wanted to point out the the the muzzle muzzle flares in breech are
terrible oh sure uh and but they are decent in
apex honestly i think they're shooting blanks in apex that would be a shocker
if they were because there's that shot where they're like i think the you know he's over there everybody fire your guns away oh the predator shot yeah yes the
predator shot and and you can see um shells flying out which which could very well be a plug-in
now but it they look more real and then in the space movie breach they're like
very bad they look like like they're like 40 year old plug-in effects and
then the flamethrowers are terrible looking too [ __ ] [ __ ]
well i watched because we both watched apex you watched breach i watched american siege
which is another edward drake join uh and i watching it right after apex
again with that the grading curve was like oh this isn't this doesn't look too bad it's one of those things where
you look at it from a distance it's like oh this is fine but then you start looking at the details and you're like oh this is this
is [ __ ] um it's it's a georgia shot one not in canada it was shot in georgia and
everybody has a southern accent and it's all handheld to give it that gritty
gritty cop movie look and you add a [ __ ] brown color grade to everything so
it looks like a real movie but within the first 10 minutes because you when you think about like
the sound or something's wrong something's wrong because when you think about like sound recording for a movie
everyone pictures the guy with the boom pole but a lot of movies also use wireless mics rarely do actors smack their wireless
mic oh no like this and the sound is kept in the movie oh my goodness gracious that happens
stephanie lewis are you on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
but the plot of this one is bruce willis is a cop he gets a call that a doctor is
being held hostage in his house the hostage takers are there because one
of them just got out of jail so it's him and his i think it's his brother and his girlfriend and they go uh and hold this
doctor hostage because they're convinced that this doctor knows something about what happened to the
sister she went missing i don't know what happened to her and they're convinced that the doctor knows something about it
he's in some sort of big conspiracy i'm so bored he has a comical fake like bank
vault door in his house and they're trying to get it open and it's just got [ __ ] like glued to it
like hot glued to it is it made of styrofoam it looks some of the pieces could be made of styrofoam
i'm going to find out all you secrets i am but they're like the secret to what happened to his sister's gotta be behind
this bank vault door that's in this two-story house um they finally get the
bank vault open halfway through the movie and this is a two-story house in georgia and when they walk down it leads
to stairs going down into a basement the basement turns out to be like an underground
like drug ring where they're like making new drugs and testing the drugs out on
like captive people and the bank vault was the door to the underground yeah so they walk down the stairs and they're
magically in like like a 20-foot tall warehouse
that's supposed to be underneath this residential house even though it's underground there's windows with
sunlight shining through okay so between that and the the lady hitting
her microphone is like again they're not even trying oh wow but
but the big twist of the movie is that uh the sister that went missing she was actually they thought that they like
kidnapped her and held her hostage in this drug basement but turns out she was actually like the ringleader of this
whole drug operation but also the cops are in on it that's the big twists
except for bruce willis he finds out the cops are in on it and then he just walks out of the movie
and then i guess he has a change of heart and he comes back and his big clever plan to stop the dirty cops is to
just walk up to him one by one i love it that's where you see the bad uh it's
like double yeah walking towards the camera yeah he doesn't he just walks up to him and just
shoots them just lots of shots i'm just standing there shooting ninety percent of the movie is the cops
just standing on the front that's the meat that that's the filler yeah the filler of what we're in the woods they
try to send a drone and the the the criminals inside just immediately shoot it down and then that's the end of that
yeah because you know when you make one of these ship movies you can't afford the time
to have twists and turns different locations yeah different characters you know well the twist i
guess is that the cops are in on it that's that's you can have a twist but i mean like you can't afford like multiple
locations multiple locations multiple story lines multiple you know they leave the house and then it goes
here and there in the middle you you need your setup your ending and then fill the middle stretch the middle
and like apex the the bad guys two of
them run into each other then they have an over-the-shoulder uh uh conversation that goes on for
eight minutes where they say yeah i'm i'm a hunter generic movie dialogue i come here to
show who i am on the inside because uh out there in the real world uh you know
i'm just this guy and here on this island i can hunt down and go and then and then they kill each other and bruce
willis goes insert shot of bruce looking behind a tree if they kill each
other one kills the other and leaves then two more find each other and talk for 15 minutes yeah that's that's your
meat and then the end so i was wondering about american siege in in breach it's walking around
hallways
one other weird thing going back to
bruce willis having an earpiece that feeds him his lines there's one shot in the movie where it shows up so much like
they don't even try to hide it in some of these shots but there's one shot where it's like a complete profile
and i think they tried to like digitally brush it out because he has like a
cavernous void in his ear it's like pure black and i think they like brushed painted that over the frame
are you talking about i think they painted over the the earpiece with like just black so it looks like like pure black inside
his ear trying to cover the earpiece trying to hide the earpiece yeah okay okay but then like in
the next shot yeah but then the next shot you just see it and it's like an extreme close-up of his head
so i don't know it's so the earpiece thing is weird to me some shots it's there and then he turns
his head and it's the next shot and it's gone bruce willis he went from a hairpiece to an earpiece
so that's the ones that we watched in
their entirety yes jay um and you you you rented all of these films absolutely i
paid money for all of them like like a good citizen you paid to own them yes these are in my digital library you're
allowed to have a digital copy of all these movies because you legally bought
all of them of course of course and i scrubbed through them okay and i found uh reoccurring things in a lot of them
but there are multiple movies where he spends a good bulk of them uh cameron mitchell style just sitting in a
chair and then going along with that during action scenes he frequently gets tied to a chair
because then you can have an action scene where he doesn't have to do anything and a character just walks up and punches him
there's a really weird edit in one where he's tied to a chair and he's getting his face punched and it's clearly it's
from behind so it's clearly a body double and then somebody else throws a bomb into the
scene and the bomb goes off and it cuts to like a freeze frame of the back of his head close your eyes sir
and then just dissolves to the villain laying on the ground and i didn't know what was happening
whenever bruce willis gets punched i'm just curious it cuts to the body double glass oh yes
yes he won't it doesn't even cut back and forth there's one shot and i think it's i think it's deadlock it might be
fortress i get all these movies mixed up but where it just holds on the villain punching him repeatedly in one
continuous shot
oh also fortress is a weird one i wish i would have watched the whole thing because every time i skimmed through it i found something great so there's this
one scene where bruce willis walks in and it's like shannon doherty and a group of characters and even though he doesn't do this in
the rest of the movie bruce willis just has a gravelly voice all of a sudden he's like how can i help you guys it's
frederick balzari dad that's not possible it's him what does he want
me it's like sounds like krusty the cloud
well maybe that was like the first scene they shot and then they said well let's lose that ease up on the voice maybe
maybe it's it's it's it's like uh christopher nolan's batman but they forgot to say
he's up on the voice the entire film oh [ __ ] you'll be in a better channel
forever we're supposed to stop we're supposed to tell christian not to do that i'm not wearing hockey pads they're
cutting the movie together and they're like christian bale talks like this through the whole thing where are they
oh day one line one we said we were gonna tell them to stop oh
[ __ ] i showed you well i guess we got to keep it for the next two films
keep working old man i'll take you anytime punk it's
astounding the level of laziness in these movies is is unparalleled
it's shameless it's shameless shameful it should be shameful shameful yeah they are shameless
so what's what's our takeaway from this what is our take away from this what what what what
is our takeaway from this we are fascinated you and i we we love movies we love the
the movie business well we also love bad movies
yes that's true and these aren't funny bad movies no apex comes close but it's very boring
they're all boring they're all boring if it was just a junk movie that
somebody made for you know a couple thousand bucks and it ended up on streaming and we watched it and but the
fact that they have a like like a former a-list celebrity in in them
and then they're banking their entire business model on that yeah where they like we don't have to do
anything else and there there is there's there's a business angle to it
that is fascinating to talk about well there's only a business angle to the movies i guess that's the interesting
thing they've completely removed even the like the smallest element of art from any of these and and yes the
the movie business is a business um and so yeah you're a director of a film you have x amount of days to
complete it you have a budget you know they're it's that fine line between art and
entertainment and art and a product yeah and and that's that's fascinating to us
but this is like you know where the the levels you know so the scales of justice you know
the blind woman with the justice scales where they're just like it's like this
where where uh the director has just a razor thin
razor thin uh amount of wiggle room for for any kind
of artistic expression there's almost zero percent yeah it's like you gotta get this shot and you gotta shoot bruce
willis scenes in 48 hours yeah and there's 95 pages of dialogue how are you
going to do that well we'll put a [ __ ] earpiece in him and have him in this scene for 12 minutes and he just go
go go lie okay get get them in the car going to the golf course we're shooting that scene there go go go go you know
and also speaking of the dialogue and the idea not just the dialogue i guess but the whole all the movies are nothing
but it's like like they're just writing what sounds like it would be in a movie you
know just like the most generic of cliches and conventions my name is jack
jack harris i'm a cop
my wife uh she died and never trying to like elevate it past
that in any way right she's like this is the things you have to put in a movie in order for it to be considered a movie
right yeah it it it spins my head around well when the
movies are this bad i know like like the idea like we talked about the the pre-selling the movies that was
something that uh charles band did with like empire pictures he would come up with these posters these fun concepts
like dungeon master or like puppet master or whatever and he would pre-sale pre-sell the movies in foreign markets
based on the poster all the posters and these are just bruce willis bored face it's just it's just
banking on the celebrity's name yeah that's it that's it um and that name will eventually run out
of steam or be tarnished yeah like i i kept saying edward drake is the worst
filmmaker ever but it's like what stipulations was he given like maybe if he was left to his own devices he would
do something better i don't know is he the best filmmaker ever because he able was able to pull this off pull his
movies off who knows was he all i know is if you have an actor smack their microphone in the shot
you don't leave it in the movie yeah yeah yeah but i don't know how much uh say he had in the editorial process they
just gave him the footage and someone went through and used the first take of everything and said i'm done what if
it's like like what if edward drake is just like a genius with time management and and and stay
she smacked the mic and take it doesn't matter we have to move on yeah we have to move out
we have four hours left with this actor or actress we have to move on it's fine
we'll fix it in post we'll remove the bump the you know and then they forgot to do that
unbeknownst to him you know you don't know yeah i guess that's the ultimate thing is like yeah the movie is the
thing you watch the movie and that's all that really matters we can speculate about behind the scenes stuff but if
you're just some random person looking through movies on amazon or whatever hey bruce willis
movie and you watch it you're gonna be disappointed it's gonna suck and and also it's it's
it's your time too which is more valuable than anything yeah these movies aren't worth
right any of your time no there are much better movies any movie literally any movie
i i'm speaking earnestly yeah any movie that's on streaming
is worth your time more than any one of these 11 movies yeah but so should
people watch them no out of curiosity no oh don't support this
like we did you've seen enough in these clips now you get it now the word is out the word is out to
avoid any movie with bruce willis basically yeah unless it's directed by quentin tarantino
that's the only exception i'll take you anytime punk
