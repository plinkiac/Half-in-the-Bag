Half in the bag.
well jay it's official wisconsin has
locked down again
Fuck man
this is the third time we've sheltered in place reopened and then sheltered in place again
i'm starting to think no one has any idea what they're doing
what
oh fuck it
i say we just all get coronavirus and get it over with
we'll probably lose betty white
but who cares
she wore blackface
and with california closing down again who will make all these terrible movies that we endlessly complain about
ah jay
do you remember the good old days when there was a new marvel or star wars movie released every five days or so
now we have to wait till 2025 to see black widow in the movie theaters when they reopen
if they reopen
well they did reopen last week
and i actually did go to see a movie
i had to download a chinese app in order to download a different russian
app that linked to my bank account
in order to buy a ticket from something
called movie ticket
magic it was very sketchy
right then when you walk into the
theater they take your temperature
and make you stand in a plexiglass box
where a teenager in a hazmat suit
scans your phone with some weird device
the device has all sorts of weird
radiation stickers all over it it kind
of freaked me out a little bit
well i tried to buy concessions at the
movie theater
oh my god i couldn't wait in line
because of social distancing
so i had to download a north korean app
called popcorn
magic in order to buy concessions
i placed my order on my cellular phone
and a drone emerged from the ceiling to
bring me my popcorn and soda
after it had delivered my popcorn and
soda it disinfected the area with some
kind of
antiseptic mist most of it got in my
food and in my eyes
after the drone flew away it lost
control and crashed into an elderly
couple
setting them a fire they screamed and
screamed and yelled aloud
help we're on fire
a teenager rushed over with a fire
extinguisher
and tried to spray them but because of
social distancing
the fire extinguisher couldn't reach
them so he did the only thing he could
watch them burn well in my theater
they only sold five seats out of a
hundred because of social distancing
but it's okay because the ticket was
discounted to a dollar
fifty it's a business model that's sure
to last
well i was the only one in my theater
jay but right before i went to see the
movie i had read an article that said
coronavirus can get into your eyes
and into your ears so while i was at the
movie i wore earplugs
eye patches over both eyes and a facial
mask
so how'd you even see the movie
or eat your concessions what
jesus christ what'd you say about jeff
sessions
i said how'd you see the movie or eat
your concessions
oh i didn't do either the movie was the
matrix so i seen it before
yeah you know i saw that the matrix was
in the top box office for the weekend
along with back to the future three
a bunch of harry potter movies footloose
mean girls austin powers e.t
greece the avengers they all grossed
right around a thousand dollars each
there are literally no new movies out
for theaters to show
other than followed all i know
is that the top grossing film released
in 2020
was bad boys for life and the
second top grossing film was 1917.
a movie that didn't even come out this
year
i can't wait for the oscars here's the
list of the nominees
you know jay i've been watching a lot of
streaming movies lately
would you like to talk about say two
that we've both seen mike i can honestly
say
i've never worn blackface what
what
number
the please of night in light of this new
evidence
cdc recommends wearing cloth face
coverings in public settings
where other social distancing measures
are difficult to maintain
i.e grocery stores pharmacies especially
in areas of significant community-based
transmission practice good hygiene avoid
social gatherings in groups of more than
10 people
wash your hands especially after
touching your genitals
or other frequently used items or
surfaces
avoid touching your face your partner's
face
your grandma's face or your grandma's
vagina
so the vest of night um uh
movie that's been out quite a while now
uh and uh you know it's a
it's it's in our uh it's in our
wheelhouse
our love of science fiction low budget
movies
uh both of the movies we're talking
about are low budget we should point
that out
one more skillfully made than the other
we all know which one you're talking
about
of course of course uh
but yeah that's the night um uh wow what
a film
what a film i watched it on my
television this is i guess it's kind of
been like a word of mouth movie where
people started saying like have you seen
vest of night have you watched fast of
night yeah
i think it's probably a little divisive
because if you're just looking at it
from a story perspective
not much happens um but it's
the way the movie is made it's a little
a little
um it's a little hard for an average
viewer to slide into this movie it
doesn't start off showy
and uh look at me i'm a movie arlo's
under the stands figuring it out because
last time it happened it was a squirrel
that had bitten through a wire but the
wire was still in the squirrel's mouth
of the skeleton so it just
launched all the electric cause we can't
roll up the slicker it starts off
in these in these really long one-take
shots and um which are show-off if
you're paying attention to the
filmmaking but they're not like drawing
like bringing attention to themselves
right it just kind of happens naturally
as
characters talk a lot i guess we'll have
little speakers and microphones instead
and on one side you'll have the dial and
on the back the back will be a little
putt screen so like a miniature
television screen
and it's neat it's not done in the
traditional setup
uh like how how you how you think a
movie would be constructed you know you
know all the shots he pulls up and stops
his car and gets out and they call him
he
answers the phone at the radio station
we have establishing shots at the
basketball game
it's just like the cameras are sort of
flowing behind him and he's just
chatting with people and there's things
it's
martin scorsese the good fellas one take
shot kind of thing it's not one take
there's breaks of course but there's
like little details going on the kid
with the trombone
or trumpet he all uh why drops you going
around and goes under under the
bleachers there's an electrical problem
everyone they got them confused with
another person
it's building its world it's a little
small town everybody knows each other
we don't have to be told too much
information we're just kind of thrown in
and so it's a little off-putting at
first because you're just like
the movie's not acting like a movie it
normally does
this is weird i can't understand what
anybody's saying and uh what's going on
and they start to explain like that
whole opening they're talking about the
tape recorder and they're just
establishing all the characters
without uh a bunch of like blanket
exposition
right you get to know the characters
just based on the way they interact with
each other especially the main
guy in the main girl right uh yeah
everett and faye
faye is the uh everett's the guy works
at the radio station
and then faye is like i don't know a kid
in high school and she's interested in
the
the tech stuff the radius she has her
own tape recorder which is a novelty in
1950 something yeah um and she works at
the uh the phone
yes she's a switchboard operator which
uh
is one of the most impressive scenes in
the movie
boeing has introduced its new line of
very own
and this is this is where uh because
also based on the film like we said the
story is
is whatever aliens are invading but it's
the way the story is told and this is an
example of like really
building atmosphere and tension without
seeing anything is her at this
switchboard going back and forth
and it just holds on her it kind of very
very
subtly you know goes in comes back wider
and it goes on forever
and it's all just listening it's her
listening and then later in the movie we
have
everett at the radio station just
listening on the phone we don't see
anything
it's all told with just atmosphere and
uh using your imagination and sound yeah
i'd be curious to find out how long or
how many times that actress
practiced that scene that moving the
things around yeah well that's the other
thing too is expecting a young actress
to know how to work an old-timey
switchboard like that i'm sure that
required some practice practice
practice they got a nine-year-old lady
in there oh i used to do this to do this
and this and this
yeah yeah she learned it that's what i
that's their job actress you want to be
an actor you got to be good at
remembering lines you should be an
acting teacher
i know you got to go to remembering
lines and you can't constantly fuck up
that's
49.95 for my class
you were entering paradox theater
uh it starts off with a little play on
the twilight zone where it shows like
like an old 1950s tv and it's moving in
and
they're basically saying this is an
episode of the twilight zone in movie
form
so don't get your your hopes up too high
you know we're not making independence
day
we're not making independence so yeah it
establishes that tone
right away with that shot and goes into
the tv but then the tone isn't
corny it's not trying to be like a
throwback movie no it's just takes place
in the 50s and it's very simple
but you say corny uh when you think
it's a movie about aliens and you know
uh uh but but the the the word aliens is
never spoken
they never say roswell and uh flying
saucer none of that's ever come up
and it's just the kid the kid basically
says like
ruskies or you know is it the commies
and because the flying saucer thing you
know
roswell was 47 and that wasn't until
like the
50s the first that couple that got
abducted
it wasn't in the the mass culture
mindset flying saucers and abductions
yeah so not quite yet
played it nice and straight and simple
but we have lots of long takes
you know we're talking filmmaking we're
talking techniques lots of long takes in
the beginning
but then once like things start
happening
kind of it shifts gears and it becomes
lots of
fast cuts close-ups and certain times
the technique changes a lot yeah when it
needs to when it needs to it keeps you
keeps you interested yeah it's not uh uh
just like endless long takes out last
days by gus
van sant yes exactly well then there's
also a go to
talk about long takes even when there is
a long take there's like that one shot
that
i think it starts at the uh like the
switchboard or at the the phone company
yeah and then it like goes all across
this
field and into the uh the gymnasium but
it's like it's like all of a sudden it
turns into a sam raimi movie and it's
it's
impressive it's a little show-offy but
it's also just establishing how close
all these things are
to each other they're like hey we're in
a small town yeah
we had a collaborator who's one of our
executive producers who
literally for real uh
laid himself out on a go-kart that we
sourced from an 18 year old farm boy
locally there in whitney texas
and then it was and then it was off to
the races at 40 miles an hour and then
it was other handoffs
and yeah and then it was you know build
these lights in a way that
whenever you pass underneath them you
don't have a shadow you know of this
go-kart in this camera system but then
it'll also slow down
they go to an elderly woman's house at
one point and it's just just
holds on her that's another one where it
feels like it's probably 10 minutes of
her explaining the story
i love shots like that or scenes like
that when
when someone is telling like a really
long
emotional story and they're not playing
for
cutaways all the whole time and then you
just you're just sitting there just like
kind of engrossed in
the story like like you're there
listening to it yourself and you're not
and then you finally see the reaction
later
and that night in the middle of the
night he walked out the front door of
this house
and vanished how
he was taken up from this earth yeah
that sequence reminded me of the uh the
jaws the indianapolis speech that quint
does and jaws i think that does cut to
their reactions a little bit but a lot
of it is just
going in on robert shaw's face and there
are
should we go into spoilers um
yes
it's it's it's a movie that isn't isn't
really like twists and turns constantly
it's interesting but um it does have a
conclusion
and we'll talk about that and skip past
this time code to get to
our aqua splash review
which is a whole different kind of low
budget movie
equally light on story though equally
light on story
yes uh slightly
less impressive performances but we're
gonna get into splash
so if you really want to just enjoy vast
night as a fresh view we probably give
it our i give it my recommendation oh
absolutely
um so go ahead and watch it uh well i
was just going to talk about
a spaceship does show up at the end
and as far as the resourcefulness of the
filmmaking where it's it's an impressive
effect the ship itself is you don't like
the ship
oh no i'm fine with that okay i'm
surprised yeah no no i was fine with
that because
it's been building up so slowly
throughout the movie
i would be disappointed if they showed
it and it was like a shitty cgi
like it looks like it's probably a
miniature or something
like it looks impressive and
incorporated into its environment
way better than you know 100 200 million
movies and it's only shown very briefly
so it's like okay
they dumped the appropriate amount of
money into getting that shot right
yeah so it feels as kind of real and
believable as the rest of the movie did
well that's that's the uh the the the to
be your not to be
moment at the end it's the fork in the
road
yeah and i'm sure there's people on both
sides of the fence that say
they shouldn't have shown it they should
have just like like looked up and maybe
saw some lights and then they were gone
oh did they did they get killed by the
zodiac
with his you know he showed up what
happened to them did they just
uh something mysterious happened did
they cross into
to a fucking lay line and go into
another dimension
did aliens beam them up who knows or you
do the artsy non-ending
where they go to a field and they're
walking out and the music swells and
then you just cut the black
it's like the ending of sopranos right
doesn't it just cut the black and you're
like what happened
tony soprano got shot in the head you
don't know that
yeah well we don't know what it's like
to be shot in the head and die
i wish anyways uh so yeah ambiguous or
non-ambiguous
i for one really liked the ufo ending
because you spend this whole time you
know
building it up and they're they're
skirting around aliens
and then it's like oh my gosh it's real
and then they get abducted
and it's kind of like oh you know it's
sad
you like your characters yeah so
something really bad happened to me
and all they're doing is just trying to
figure out what the fuck is happening
yeah it's a very simple story i don't
know who produced it it's an amazon film
but i don't know if it was made
independently and then amazon picked it
up
yeah okay um it played a bunch of film
festivals like it went over really well
filmed festivals
crowds liked it much like our second
film
they're right yeah same uh critical
darling they call them i don't know if
you could call the uh the director's
basement a film festival
well the director's mom's basement okay
okay somebody else put
on the film festival not the director
it's the director's mom okay
yes so that makes it legit there's a red
carpet but it's just because
the mom has a drinking problem and she
spills wine a lot mm-hmm
he asked for jokes the jokes just like
they just appear and most times they're
bad
they've come here before they've liked
this place
they always have but yeah invest tonight
that's worth the watch
yeah absolutely um it's it's uh
especially
in these times oh yeah you're just where
everyone's just looking for
entertaining things to watch it's a
movie that it's uh you get sucked into
the atmosphere
and you just kind of let it wash over
you it's it's really
really sad um
it's becoming a desert an entertainment
desert while
going on streaming like netflix and uh
amazon and i saw a trailer for baby
frankenstein
and and it's like that's one of the more
recent and it's just
i want to watch baby frankenstein watch
the trailer for us we'll show a clip
here
oh god it looks like it was made in 2004
there's a kid with just makeup on and
he's just running around in the woods
is it a baby frankenstein baby frank
frankincense not not like
infant frankenstein but more like i
don't know ten eight-year-old
frankenstein
that doesn't have the same ring as a
title but they show it like the cover of
course looks like a terrible like asylum
or red box cover
and it's just like a baby frankenstein
with a rattle well that's the thing to
point
out yeah it's because you hear like oh
super low budget
you know alien invasion movie or
something i just picture all the
like the production value of something
like a baby frankenstein like
there's so many of those type of movies
on especially on like amazon prime
where they all yeah they all look like
they were shot they're like came out
last year but they all look like they
were shot on
you know a camera from 15 years ago they
just look like trash
i lost you clown
and then you get something like vast of
night which has a low budget but
is incredibly resourceful and knows uh
exactly where to put all of its elements
yeah it looks it looks good it looks a
little
over post produced they added like a
film grain effect
which which a lot of lower budget movies
do but they usually do it very subtle
where you don't even really notice it
it's just there to give the image some
texture
they overdid it just enough in this
where i i thought it worked as far as
like an old-timey movie goes and they
kind of
uh decrease the contrast a bit it looks
slightly
you know less contrasty than most movies
which i
liked because you look at bigger movies
now and they
crank up that contrast they crush the
black so much
and everything's like over saturated and
the blacks are super black
and i don't like that i like it a little
more subtle so i like the look of this
movie a lot good thing
it wasn't a big like summer movie season
something like bass at night
just vanished gotten buried that's the
advantage of uh
streaming services and especially
releasing something like that
direct to amazon yeah is a movie like
that or like uh
even like the irishman even though it's
made by martin scorsese
if that were released in theaters and
didn't go to netflix it would have
flopped
with today's like audiences and what is
successful at the box office
irishmen would have just been like a
gigantic flop
yeah but the people that are a little
more
patient they stay at home and they watch
a three and a half hour martin scorsese
movie and they can soak it in
the elderly would have liked irishmen at
the theater that would have been a big
hit for them
they would have made it to the end of
the movie though
the last thing they would have seen is a
digitally de-aged joe pesci
before they they went up to the pearly
gates
there's something in the sky
all right everyone listen up the ride
committee have worked hard to make this
weekend to die for aqua slash is thought
to spread mainly
through close contact from person to
person some people without symptoms
may be able to spread aqua slash we are
still learning about how
aqua slash spreads and the severity
of illness it causes
you know what's weird when you read the
the the synopsis for aqua slash
all i hear is like the coronavirus shit
i know it's just it's everywhere that's
all you hear anybody talking about no
it's like even when you're just trying
to explain the plot of some
bad b movie it's weird it's weird it's
weird it's weird
speaking of weird yeah why didn't we
watch
aqua slash uh this one i hadn't even
heard of this thing you're just like
look at the trailer for aqua slash
i i do some deep diving when it comes to
looking for
films to watch digging into the the
bowels of voodoo
looking for anything to watch that uh
might be interesting and then i saw this
trailer for aquas
slash first thing we got to point out is
the title is fucking terrible and hard to say
yes i had to look it up because
obviously aqua slash you know it's a
play
you just in your brain you know that
it's aqua splash
even though i didn't know what that was
i looked it up i found like a pool
company called aqua splash
so i guess someone knows what it is and
they're doing a a clever play on that
but yeah see i during the film i was
hoping for
uh like a a clever that was the name of
the
the water park aqua splash and then like
um s
p l a s h s
l a s h right yeah so it's just the one
letter
where like the p breaks and falls off
yeah
like motel hello yeah yeah yeah where
it's like oh okay
yeah the o burns out of motel hello
which becomes motel hell
uh well okay so the premise
you know so it's like watching this hey
hey hey
hey uh annoying teenagers are going down
water slides
and then they ching they show blades go
through and yeah and it
it's like i'm in i'll watch it yeah um
but then
you know you got to watch that trailer
and the trailer was deceptive
for aqua slash i don't know i think it
it offered exactly what you get in the
movie because the movie has
one idea
which is these crossblades going through
uh a water slide that's the one idea the
movie has
so what's wrong with the movie why is
the movie bad
because it delivers on its promise
of uh plus oh another very important
thing to note the movie is
71 minutes long it's barely a feature
film well that's that's
i want to give the movie some credit
because uh
i mean it is bad it's not quite best of
the worst bad
it's just sort of generally bad but
they know that they only have one idea
so they just said let's have a first act
and a third act and then get the fuck out
so he has no second act
sets up of all of our characters because
you hear that title and it sounds like
oh it's gonna be a slasher movie set
in an amusement park or in a water slide
park so i was expecting like a slasher
movie
and it really isn't it's a bunch of
boring
interchangeable crackers for the first
45 minutes
but then the final act of the movie is
they keep finding ways
to have people i was like oh there's not
lots of different types of killings like
a friday the 13th
it's just this one water slide and they
just keep finding ways to make more
people go
down that water slide and that's where
it started to become entertaining to me
this uh we have we have um we have radar
for for what's american and what's not
and my this is not american radar went
off
and oh because painfully obvious later
that it's canadian
because they give up trying to hide
their
accents i'm just trying to be here to be
a dad yeah
not happening why are you here anyway
what's your name get off the platform
don't go down
hey fuck you dude
this is not american
i can just tell
even though it takes place in connecticut
they have connecticut license plates on the cars
and i'm just like no no no no
looked it up
canadian
canadian
whether they shot it there or if they just crossed over
like the pit
like the pitt, yeah
remember that
that was a canadian movie that was shot in wisconsin middle of nowhere wisconsin
they went around the niagara falls and they got down in connecticut and filmed
their movie ran back up
before anybody noticed before anybody
noticed shot it on a weekend my guess is
they had access to this water park that
was
defunct sure um well i don't know if it
is because there's a part
where the the cheating husband character
uh someone we have the point of view of
the killer
and they have a gun pointed at him and
that entire time he's like pleading not
to shoot him
you can see people going up the water
slide behind him
oh and so like the gun goes off
someone would have noticed that but
nobody apparently did in the film
so i wonder if that that was shot while
the park was actually open yeah
maybe maybe they closed for a couple
days yeah who cares
i think this movie obviously knew it had
a one
trick gimmick and they they
they did all the the right things
to kind of create a little plotline
and then lots of lots of little drama
going on between the characters and try
to
um justify the logic
of having many people get killed on a
water slide without anybody
figuring out how to stop it we'll talk
about those real quick but i just think
the execution was so
so poor it reminded me of like like
haunted ween
or one of those like like 80s best of
the worst movies that that are just like
bafflingly bad what was the movie where
death throws the guy off the roof
oh spookies spookies yeah it's funny
that you say that because that's exactly
what i wanted to mention
is if this movie was made in 1987 and
was shot on 16 millimeter
it would be getting a beautiful blu-ray
release from vinegar syndrome right now
yeah it feels like that without
intentionally trying to do this
without being intentionally retro or
we're making natives movie it was
it was that 80s mid 80s incompetent
yes just just blindly
done without without
irony which kind of kind of has its own
charm if you're into that kind of stuff
i know you're less so than me but i've
seen or i've started to try and watch
a number of movies on amazon prime like
i was talking earlier about stuff that
is just like shot on cheap like digital
cameras and they look like
garbage and they're all trying to do the
like 80s throwback
there's so many like 80s style slasher
movies and they're all
awful and they're all really like
tongue-in-cheek
they feel like trauma movies or
something and this was so sincere
it was bad but there was still something
kind of charming about it to me
yeah i mean if if oh god
it becomes you start to go cross-eyed if
they were trying to make
a legitimate unintentionally bad
80s movie without
being ironic about it and without
like self-conscious but not or
self-aware but not trying to let the
audience know it's self-aware
yeah then they succeeded like
they wanted to make a modern day best of
the worst movie
okay so so the premise is teenagers have
just graduated high school
it's tradition in a small town to go to
this water park
and just do cocaine and ecstasy and
heroin and whatever goes
everyone's going crazy doing drugs
apparently there's injuries there every
year that it happens there's some line about that
every fucking year wilkinson
yeah yeah
thank you doctor
okay can you just get them out of here please
a couple goes up to the top of the water slide and they're having sex
mmhmm
and somebody cuts the guy in half and
his torso falls in the ground and that
has nothing to do
yeah that that doesn't especially when
you get the reveal of who the killer is
at the end it's like what did any of
that opening have to do with anything
well
the only thing that had to do is to set
up the red herring which is the old guy
i'm conrad carter i'll make everything
work here all by yourself
how old are you man you want to find out
kid
it's funny they show him in 1988 and
he's like like a 20 year old guy like
the you know and then it cuts to now and
he's like
78. he's got he's got like obi-wan
kenobi syndrome
and he's like i used to work here and
all these kids and so he's a red herring
to make you think he was the one who
committed the murder
he's got characters in every slasher
movie yeah so it's like okay what's that
him
right i rolled him out right away that
whole scene in the beginning was
pointless i don't know who killed
those young lovers on top of the water
slide
it wasn't the old man that has nothing
to do with anything yeah it's just a
misleading so then we've got to
establish some characters we have
we have the band that's going to play
some 80s songs they licensed an
actual lady song i was surprised by that
and
sung it very well oh my god
we gotta hire an actor who can sing too
so we don't have to dub the vocals over
the studio track would it be cheaper if
we just hired someone to
connect or sing oh let's do that he was
a fine actor
he was fine the the the woman that runs
the water park with her husband
she was pretty good go to hell what
come on what's your problem
fuck you paul
well that that seemed like at first i
thought she was one of the teenagers
yeah she doesn't look too much older no
and then they show her walking right
and and she's in like a bikini and i was
like well what's the problem and they're
like
she's a milf that'll that fucks teenage guys once
one teenage guy every i'm like what are
you talking about
they're like she's class of 1992
and i'm like that would make her like 48 years old
i heard she chooses one guy every year
a guy
to do what
to fuck
have sex you idiot
uh but i thought she was like an old b-movie scream queen kind of thing
that's how you cast in that role
exactly
and i think they maybe they tried but i looked and you know oh one character on csi and kind of been in some real things
yeah
who
and then um and then uh okay so then you have the little the little the rock and roll guy and he's in love with a girl who's dating the jock
everybody's cheating on everybody in the opening half of this movie
so there's some some fucking
both of the owners of the water park, it's a husband and wife, he's cheating on her
she apparently cheats on him with a different kid every summer
yeah so just everybody's cheating on everybody
yeah
are you fucking kidding me
get out of here
i'm so sorry dude
the dad of the rock and roll guy
our lead character i don't remember his
name and he's like
you're the lobster scene
the eyes oh don't be grossed out
i don't believe in waste
and so there's like some kind of little
plot about who's gonna control the water
park
and and it's just you know it's just
filler um the premise is to get
kids into a slide so that they could get
cut
it's one after the other and so there's
some rubber torsos
it's pretty great those last 20 minutes
the fact that they keep coming up with
convoluted ways to have kids just keep
going down those slides
conrad can we send the next ones down
it's basically a case where everybody
has to be as stupid as possible for the
events of the movie to happen
right yeah because that is something we
say a lot on best of the worst
it's like why are they doing this oh
because the movie needs to happen yeah
we need an abbreviation or some sort of
some sort of phrase or word for that
aqua slash we'll just call it but then
you have to say aqua slash over and over
and i never want to say that again
well it's funny you mentioned too the
you know something's off is this
not shot in america it turns out it's
canadian but then there's weird stuff
that reminded me of some of the bizarre
like 80s italian movies like there's the
little kid
that doesn't really tie in with the rest
of the story
here cover it up where he's like on the
beach and he has a cut
foot that's not really explained but
he's sitting on the beach and he just
finds an old like cassette tape walkman
buried just under the surface and the
kid seems like dumb
mom look and he has nothing to do with
anything but then there's like a
mid-credit uh stinger did you even see
that part
no and it's like what is this supposed
to mean sequel bait
sequel bait because the the real killer
was traumatized as a kid so maybe this
one's traumatized
yeah the real killers
yeah the real killer is the lady but if
that's the case put that in the movie
now does a credit stinger because you've
spent so much time building up this dumb
kid
spent a little bit wide yeah yeah he has
nothing to do with anything and then his
mom falls in the bloody water
just all this random shit happens
yeah so many just weird dialogue weird
choices it's hard to describe the
weirdness
i think the director is well i guess if
he's from canada because i want to say
his name sounded french but he could be
french canadian
so yeah yeah i guess if if maybe he
speaks no english
right he just speaks french and he's
trying to direct this movie
it has that feel of yeah like we've seen
so many best of the worst movies that
are clearly shot by someone that's not
american trying to make an american
movie your troll two effects
yes where they're trying to like
listen this is how american teenagers
party right
because that lobster scene i can't get
over the lobster scene
i'm in the middle of dinner oh sure
okay later i've got a 35 year old
lobster waiting for me
look who eats a lobster picks it up and
eats it with their hands
you know yeah was this supposed to be
funny was it supposed to just
say that this guy is just like just this
evil rich monster that just consumes and
doesn't care what he looks like or
his manners i don't know it just comes
off as bizarre so many little moments in
there
like there's that scene where chad
is he's in like a hot tub
and then the girl comes running trying
to find
the bandleader guy um i'm happy you're
still here
where's josh i thought it was with you
and he comes out and he puts a towel on
and they sit down on the bed
and she's like where's you know bobby
you know oh yeah and then
and then he's like i don't know and then
bobby whatever his name comes comes in
and he's like what's going on
what happened with your dad
what the fuck is he doing here
he wants something and i don't know what
or why i don't know
he was looking for you okay bye
come on let's go for a walk
i'm like oh was that wasn't that a setup
for like
she might be with this guy now like why
is he in a towel like
what why um so so many weird things
it's a high doggy scene how much is it
it'll be 18.
keep the change hi doggy you're my
favorite customer thanks a lot
bye this is very brief and it has
nothing to do with anything why are we
seeing it
no jay he was getting roses and we
needed to see him go to the store to buy
those roses
hi doggy you're my favorite customer
that was another weird part is we have
the
owner there's the the female and male
owners of the water park
the male owner starts to go down the
water slide he's oblivious to the fact
that there's blades in it
yes but then we can reason he stops
himself for no reason yeah he starts
going down it and then we cut him like
trying to stop himself like he knows but
then he
he didn't but then he just does
how did he know 
don't let go
don't let go
what the fuck's going on
i think they realized they had to kill him off in order to make the heroines plot work
then why not just kill him off
why not him just go down and get sliced
why does he suddenly stop himself i
think we had to make our hero
the the singer in the band try to do
something heroic
oh sure because he hasn't done much else
so yeah he didn't do anything he tried
to
heroically climb up the slide just maybe save people
tell your dad to go fuck himself
i'm sorry kid
no
and so our girl, our 49 year old 30 year old
yeah
won the day because when she was a little girl her father got cut or died in a water park accident
yes
they show his head floating underwater
and she's like daddy daddy
so she was traumatized and she carried that trauma with her until she was 48
and then said i'm going to for a day for years and years and years and years and years and years and years have sex with random teenage boys water park
until this random year i decide is the year i will put swords through a water slide
why does she even
decide to work at the water park
because someday she wants to put swords
through
one of the slides she coincidentally
married a guy who
owned that water park it's a complete
coincidence huh
it's all a very messy
illogical confusing
pointless nonsensical
setup to have people go down a water
slide and get cutting out by swords
that's why it's not
pointless that is the point
literally that's literally the point do
you remember the the the half-ass
like dance-off you're miss remembering
it jay
oh we've been practicing our moves you
want to see what you've been missing
yeah show us what you can do
it's not a dance competition it's their
moves
when they go down the slide is that what
that's supposed to be
see i thought that was supposed to be a
dance no no it's it's their moves
when they're going down the slide in the
big competition
yeah okay guys that's good but just
please keep it for the slides okay
so jay would you recommend uh aqua slash
i'm almost tempted to the first 45
minutes
oh it's 70 minutes right 71 minutes yeah
the last like 20 minutes i
i was genuinely entertained but you have
to sit through a lot
some of it's like so awkward and weird
it's kind of interesting
but it's also just a lot of boring
would a virgin do this
hello so
i don't know if you're feeling
adventurous and you got nothing else to
watch maybe
yeah i'm looking at it from the
perspective of someone that watches a
lot of
b movies and watches a lot of like i
mentioned like the amazon
prime shit that is all worthless yeah
okay this sort of is interesting
in that world your bar has been lowered
yes yes
um uh it it is uh a good
case study in a train wreck we've been
seeing each other once a week for
three fucking months you asshole
just just you know what come here have a shot
you're just tripping way too hard
because we always talk about like a
concept
like you get this great concept and how
do you make it work
yeah and so if you're if you're
interested in that sort of perspective
because i'm looking at it like yeah
we've got thank god it was only 71
minutes
we got 71 minutes to fill until we get to our ending
it's 35 years this weekend
35 years since what
the murders
fuck that
we just want to slide
and that's another interesting thing to
point out real quick
is when the killings start happening
when they start hitting
hitting the sh the blades
the score ends and they have that like
monotone ringing sound like droning
yeah yeah it's like that the saving
private ryan scene when all the sound
goes out
and it's just like oh
you know where it's like in a real movie
it would be like oh this is this is the
part where we stop
yeah and we're shocked because they pull
all the sound out it's a way to like
intensify what's going on and i'm
sitting there i'm just going
uh i i want to laugh that people are
being cut
because this i'm not taking this movie
seriously see the fact that they made
that decision is what made me laugh the
stuff like that where they're
taking this dumb concept so seriously
and trying to execute it seriously
like that's where the humor came in for
me it's it's a
it's a matter of interpretation and it's
a matter of like
what what would you do yeah it's it's
just all these different decisions
many are poor decisions but it's it's
interesting it's a
how do you mold this pile of clay into
something you've got a premise
you've got a location you've got some
random characters how do you put these
pieces around differently to make
something that's actually workable
yeah um so it's fun in that regard where
you watch it and you kind of go like
oh that was bad oh that kind of worked
um
they could have done this they couldn't
so you know i i would say
for 71 minutes don't waste your good
time
but you say yes i say kind of kind of
yeah
so odd what an odd movie it's very odd i
never want to see it again in my whole
life
so how long do we have to stay in the
vcr repair shop anyway
i don't know i guess until there's a
vaccine or they say it's okay to go back
out to the bars again
then we get coronavirus we all panic
rethink our two option only strategy and
then i'll go
back inside again oh brian singer is
trending again oh my god
is he finally getting charged with
something
no hollywood is so desperate for new
content
that they're finally letting him direct
the newsies reboot that he's always
wanted to make
for some reason
so anybody can get cancelled for
something they did 15 years ago
but brian singer doesn't get cancelled
for doing 15 year olds
there it is
