half in the bag
i don't get it
whose fucking hand
is that and why would she leave the door to her hotel room unlocked
i don't get it doesn't she remember what
happened to that guy when oj
tried to steal back his sports
memorabilia well now that we've finished
the haunting of blind manner do you want
to talk about it
oh geez oh i really want to drink this
coffee
but i don't know if you can see on
camera
a chip piece of glass came off
my my job of the hut mug
i may have already swallowed it it may
have fallen on the floor or it might be
in the liquid
so i've got three options okay
one is a bad one drinking it
having already swallowed it well that's
the worst one yeah yeah but if i drink
it very slowly
and sort of filter it i may catch it
before i just ceramic
there's actually a fourth option which
is that you move the liquid to a
different cup
that's an option well there's brand new
halloween cups over there can you guys
hey there you go
yeah hold on everybody so hold on
if you need to go use the restroom these
haven't even been open
okay good that means they're probably
sort of eventually we might oh this
one's got a giant crack in it
uh eventually we might talk about some
streaming things but this is more
important
all right here we go
if you're just coming back from the
bathroom now
i'm pouring the liquid in here to make
sure there's no oh my god it's spilling
everywhere
it's all over the keyboard
i found it did you really i found it
everybody i found it
oh show it off to the camera this is
important like it i could say hey look
at that
i could sleep well at night uh i found
the chip
so whoever sent this in i will not be
suing you
for my my bleeding ulcer
that will result from this so i found it
and now i can drink
my coffee out of a plastic halloween
novelty cup this is legitimately the
best news i've heard in months
and this is one of the most riveting
half of the bags
oh it flew right on the ppe oh god
someone's gonna inhale it
so one of our uh our heroes at the
hospital
i'm gonna put it in the shot glass
now that putting it in a different glass
that's meant to consume a liquid is
probably
also a bad idea why don't you just dump
it on the floor jay okay
okay now we're going to talk about a
haunting of blind manor
yes because there's no movies out no
what's playing in theaters you know i've
never looked
well the last one is tennant the last
movie ever
what happened to um black uh black swan
black widow canceled due to corrodovirus
it's just put off that's that's in the
nebulous we don't know what's happening
with it yet
because the movie that was supposed to
save theaters and bring them back and
bring the hordes of people back was
tenant
and it flopped horribly so all these
movies that were gonna come out in like
december
november december they're like never
mind you gave them cold feet
so tenant ironically was the movie that
killed theaters just to be clear
like for people that keep saying when
are you gonna review tenant when are you
gonna review tenant one we're not going
to the fucking movie theater but two
i didn't care about tennant either way
no no i don't wow my christopher nolan's
stuff
i bet it's just as good as other
christopher nolan movies and i don't give a shit
i can tell you this i've never seen a
trailer for tennant
it never crossed my path okay i'm
vaguely aware
that it has something to do with um
time going forwards and backwards yes
and then i thought the movie was called
tenant for the longest time and then i
saw it was called
tenet and then i said oh
well that's neat that's a palindrome
yeah and then i fell asleep because i
had too much rum
okay that's fair and then the next day
i forgot about everything that happened
the previous day
welcome to 2020 mike yeah so that was
the last i thought about attendant
yeah um did you ever see uh it was
called tent
and it was about a circus that went
backwards and forwards
like like like like an elephant stumbles
during its action falls into a crowd
and then like the the the wrist the ring
master runs in the back and he has a
giant like switch
like a time switch yeah and it's like
built by this like this magician
like it's all uh it's all it takes place
in like the 1800s and this like
weird magician built this magical time
oh no
coco the elephant fell on the crowd he
pulls the switch
then it turns out that one of the people
that coco the elephant crushed
was a young adolf hitler oh and so they
have to
in 1942 the gis under a special mission
have to go find the old switch hidden in
in a in a basement in bulgaria where
there's
over time again yes and and no go back
to that moment when the elephant fell
crushing young adolf hitler yeah in the
bulgarian circus in
1892 yeah yes and then
and then they realized that sitting next
to adolf hitler was
madame curie who who created
uh a cure for um botulism or whatever
and so they have this moral dilemma it's
much like that uh episode of star trek
uh city on the edge of forever okay um
so a premise like that but
you have a bulgarian circus in the late
1800s
and a horrific elephant accident and a
time traveling
uh lever created
by a magician played by hugh jackman
played by hugh jackman who may or may
not be human oh
oh my god and then and then the ring
later of course
we'll get danny devito because he played
the ring leader in dumbo
what a great ring later or maybe we'll
get peter uh
uh uh peter um
not sarah fenowitz uh who's the littler
peter
peter dinklage dinklage she would be a
great uh ringleader
sure ringmaster what do they call it
ringmaster ringmaster
not ringleader ringleader somebody who
like runs an underworld
crime yeah i meant ringmaster the whole
time i was saying that um
and then yeah with this whole thing
peter dinklage will be much older in the
future in 1942
he'll be elderly and he'll have to
accompany
the crack team of uh like like uh
united states marines during world war
ii and
they have to fight past the nazis to get
into the underground
bunker where the bulgarian circus
equipment is held
okay i like this okay it's called tent
if studios or if movie theaters want to
bring back people
this is the movie that would do it not
not christopher nolan's loud convoluted
crap
that everybody's tired of they want
circus elephants
sitting on hitler right right
who doesn't want that anyway let's talk
about haunting of bly manor
uh this is a netflix original it is
the next film in the haunting of series
the original
or the first one was haunting of hill
house
uh gothic horror is my jam
and this is based on the turn of the
screw
partially two kids in a mansion that's
about where it ends and there's spooky
ghosts it's
a 1896 horror
novella by author henry james and i'll
tell you in 1896
a guy named henry james is not writing a
lesbian love story
you don't think so i'm just saying it
probably didn't happen
but you take this this this classic the
other one is shirley jackson
um this is this is a different author
but still they're mining
the gold from those those vintage
uh uh gothic horror novels or novellas
that i'm sure coincidentally your public
domain oh i don't know
all i know is if you want to see a more
accurate
remake or retelling of turn on the screw
you should watch a film that came out
earlier this year called
turning starring stranger kids yeah i
saw that
i didn't think it was as bad as everyone
said it's not
particularly good but that was like at
like zero percent on rotten tomatoes and
people were saying it's the worst thing
ever
i was like no no good performances some
decent atmosphere it's just that the
story gets kind of stupid
and it doesn't really have a ending it
has like multiple endings and no ending
i was watching the haunting of blind
manor and then i was like oh
okay uh this is based on the turn of the
screw
there's another film base on the turn of
the screw it's called the others
with nicole kidman
i have not seen that since the theater
is that what it was based on yeah
that was another in incarnation of the
turnout of the screw
and i watched um uh the turning
and i was like is that the movie where
the parents
walk into the lake at the end and kill
themselves
well that's the boy i was like oh that's
the boy that's
a little classier production called the
boy but it was
it was also but it was similar in the
fact that a
nanny au pair girl out of her element
comes to work at a big
palatial estate somewhere in england i
guess i don't know
this is kind of where all this like the
ghost stuff comes from
that that uh mid-1800s period when
people started doing seances
yeah i mean obviously they talked about
ghosts before then
but the the the uh modern
era the edwardian period of of
society when when they would start to do
seances
uh ghost photography was a thing way
back in the day when photography first
started
and then photographers realized they
could double exposure
i can i can take a picture of your dead
loved one
pay me 100. and your dead loved one will
appear in a photograph of you
and then there's a there's a i just need
a picture of your dead loved one
preferably a negative
so i can conjure their spirit then they
do a double exposure and there's a ghost
in the photo and everyone's amazed are
you telling me that people have been
taken advantage of for centuries now
this isn't a new thing there's a whole
building devoted to it it's called zach
baggins haunted museum
listen jay uh but ghost stories where
uh the the first episode or the first
season of
uh american horror story is about a
haunted house
yeah it's a very classic traditional
people that die in the haunted house are
trapped in it they can't leave the
the perimeter and that's kind of hunting
a fly manner
uh a an american
au pair in the 1980s
comes over to england and then she has
to take care of
miles and flora our two little kids who
have been portrayed by numerous actors
over the years in the turn of the screw
sorry if i scared you i am sorry
i like gothic horror i think you do too
i don't know
well i like yeah i do sometimes depends
on how it's executed of course but i
like mike flanagan a lot
who i was disappointed to find out he
only directed the first episode of this
season
he did the entirety of uh hill house
and i think this suffers a little bit
from that this feels a little more
generic tv showy in terms of the
execution
cinematography is fine like the lighting
and stuff is still very similar but it
doesn't
seem to have that kind of uh life that
he brings with like his camera movements
there's nothing like the episode in hill
house
that's all almost all like one take
there's nothing quite like that in this
i i i would have to re-watch every
episode and take notes
but i think i disagree with you because
when
when the credits would roll i would wait
for that directed by credit
and then i would see a name that i don't
recognize and then i would say oh this
is going to be good
this is going to be artsy they got
somebody that i've never heard of
and then you notice little style choices
that are different in every episode it's
like
like a movie with multiple sequels with
different directors yeah
some are a little more like or a season
of a tv show where there's different
directors for different episodes well
you know what
this is though that this has more
artistic artistic freedom well
what i like and don't like about this
whole kind of format because now it's on
netflix
it's a limited series it's not like a
continuing every season
you know it's just continuation of the
same story and what i
like is that that allows the
storytelling to be done in a different
way
how it's like okay the first few
episodes we set up our main character we
set up her scenario
but then we can do a whole episode
that's just focusing on one character
which you can't really do on a more
traditional tv series so i like that
uh freedom as far as the storytelling
goes yeah yeah
um the side characters in this i like
that they could do that that focus on
them
but in terms of this series it didn't
completely work for me
i like the side characters i just don't
think that the once
especially when you finish it the
overall story i didn't
feel like it added that much to it
knowing the specifics of their
backstories
i suppose i could see it that way i'm
more happy that the
ending was was satisfying and
um i don't want to get into spoilers too
much you you got the
backstory of the origin
of the maine ghost and that flashback
episode that went back to
sixteen hundreds whatever it was on the
black and white episode the black and
white episode um
which was my favorite episode it was
excellent um
let's just break it down like this right
episodic television you got something
like
star trek the next generation i haven't
brought it up before
but i'm going to bring it up now star
trek the next generation you got 26
episodes a season every episode has to
have a beginning a middle and an end
it has to end unless you're doing a
two-parter of course and it's done in
five acts
it's done in 41 minutes and science to
it intro 4x
you can't stray you can't take 25
minutes
to have a scene where uh counselor troy
smokes a cigarette and reads this book
and
and has a flashback to when she was 10
years old
and something happened to her and that
it takes up 20 minutes of a 41 minute
episode
you can't do that you don't have that
freedom you have to hit all of your
beats
perfectly down to the second and
every every you know because you also
have to factor in commercial breaks
yes those are the acts yeah and and so
you have to
ramp up to the commercial break
something interesting happens right
before it next act starts
uh rising tension rising tension
conclusion yeah
it's like a like a perfectly laid out
blueprint and every episode's different
yeah you're still telling a story but
you do have that confinement it's very
confined and then you have
something like haunting of blind manner
where you have freedom
of uh 10 episodes
to go off in these directions but as
long as you tighten it up
and you conclude it and you know what
your ending is
yes that's an important part too see
that's that's
that's the positive of of these
freewheeling
ten six eight i don't know long episodes
but then you have like dumpster fires
like star trek discovery
or star trek picard to where
the show starts and halfway through the
season
all the writers quit no one knows what's
going on they're making shit up they don't know how it ends they
just keep stringing you along
until the season's over and then
everyone shrugs their shoulders and
and they say thanks for watching all 10
episode suckers
we didn't know what we were doing yeah
that's what happened with star trek
discovery season two
no one knew what was going on it was a
dumpster fire from beginning to end
and they just kept stringing along or
like was that show lost
lost yes i mean that was that like so as
long as you have a really good plan
and you can you can flesh out characters
you can go this way and you really have
a good
idea of where you're going that's that's
what haunting of blind manner felt like
to me it felt indulgent at times but
then it felt
uh worthy of indulging at other people
well it had a yeah it had a satisfying
payoff and they
they managed to successfully
end two episodes with the exact same
cliffhanger
yeah we have a cliffhanger and you're
like oh my god i gotta watch the next
episode you go to the next episode
you watch the entire episode and then
you get to the end and we're right back
to that cliffhanger from the previous
episode and it works
there is a ghost that comes out of the
lake spoilers there's a ghost in black
matter yeah yeah yeah there's a ghost
and she has no face and she comes out of
the lake and she drags people
into the lake she cracks their neck
first in some cases
drags them into the lake and no one
knows why yeah and
this goes on for like seven episodes you
never know
and a lesser show would just have that
happen lady in the light
it's spooky it's spooky but an entire
hour-long episode is devoted to setting
up the lady in the lake's backstory yeah
and it's not set up in the beginning
it's string not strings you along but
you get invested in the modern day story
you don't really understand what's going
on with the ghosts
and then they say okay before we wrap
this shit up
we're gonna we're going to
really expand on this backstory and it
had a more powerful
impact as a result of it yeah done
telling it that way
because then you you know it's like it's
like a double
double whammy it's like you get punched
in the face then punched in the gut
so danny our lead hero our au pair
gets grabbed by the ghost and we had
seen
previously uh with with the guy
character i forget his name too the same
fate happens to him
so that that's that's always key too in
horror you set up
just how horrific something is that can
happen to somebody yeah
then it starts happening to someone you
really care about
and then you're like oh my gosh and then
we're like
that if that's not scary enough because
we know
we get the backstory of it yeah and then
it becomes even more depthful
and uh well it becomes well yeah it's
you're already uh
concerned for the main character but
then when you get the backstory of the
ghost in a very kind of
traditional classical ghost story way
there's a sadness to it
as the title says like a haunting
quality to it where there's a sadness to
the uh
the supernatural elements melon melon
melancholy
yeah that's the whole crux of gothic
horror
yes and i like that more than i mean the
james juan stuff
conjuring movies can be fun they have
their place too but
in terms of something that like
resonates and sticks with you yeah
this is where it's at there's emotion to
it it's not it's not um
uh what a visceral no like
primordial like fear you know the just
survival
this is the texas chainsaw massacre that
has its place
you know and that that there's a certain
quality to that too but this is more
um yeah it's more emotional it's more
sad especially
the end of this yeah well this
especially
bittersweet yeah i'd say more so than
the first season this is
i mean the first season's very emotional
too but this one that's about like an
entire family this is so centered on
two characters really tragedy it's yeah
there's a it's it really is
like and it it earns the emotion that it
gets by the end of it
definitely because that's it's barely a
horror story
it's a love story it's a love story and
they they're right if i had a complaint
about the show it's
there's a lot of dialogue that is very
telling you exactly
what the themes of the show are he said
it was a ghost story
it isn't it's a love story
and she could not risk the most
important thing her most
important person sometimes
once in a blue goddamn moon i guess
someone like this moon flower just might
be worth the effort
um and that's one of them like it wasn't
a ghost story it was a love
like yeah we got that that the
conversation with a bride
was a little on the nose there's a
handful of that throughout the
season where it's yeah it's really the
dialogue is spelling out
how you're supposed to feel and so much
of it is told just visually
where you don't need those specifics but
uh damn if
every actor in this isn't great there's
not one
one standout that's bad they even cast
greg sestero from the room what's going
on here
he kind of took me out of it because
he's at the very beginning in the very
end
but it's almost like it takes some balls
to cast him in a serious project
and they went for it uh and through no
fault of his own he was distracting but
it's like you cast him and you know
like people are going to see him and
they're going to i suppose yeah
a soccer mom watching this just because
it's on netflix
i didn't recognize him at first he's not
he's not given close-ups shall we
i think i'll stay here a moment you okay
just enjoying the fire
good night good night yeah i think hill
house is more consistent
uh in terms of quality from episode
episode uh but i think this one has a
stronger
payoff yes because this this season
it starts pretty you know it's slow but
it starts good the middle couple
episodes lost me a bit
like they introduced the uh the dream
hopping stuff which i found kind of
annoying and didn't really have a
satisfactory payoff i mean it ties in a
bit with the theme of like
ghosts as memories or memories of ghosts
like i get that but
like in terms of how it was executed i
didn't really like it
but then those last two or three
episodes solid
but see that's me coming from a
lover of all things paranormal and
ghosts i like that
idea of what
a different version of what it is to be
a ghost
where memories they exist
in moments and and time doesn't have any
meaning and they have to keep repeating
moments sometimes horrible ones it plays
with time it plays with perception
and what it's like to be dead yeah so
uh haunting of blind manner great
six hour or eight hour long movie and
that you don't have to sit in a corona
virus-filled movie theater
next to a fatso eating nachos in your
ear and as we said it's something that
they can
uh play around with the traditional
narrative structure with
because they don't have to follow the
rules they're not in a uh
3 000 theaters and have to please the
same audience that's going to see the
avengers
media is changing i know it's great it's
on netflix the same platform if that's
not your thing you can watch the latest
adam sandler
turd
or you can watch a 30 minute short film
where david lynch interrogates a talking
monkey
right she was the love of my life
"i'm not shitting you"
endless possibilities for the way stories can be
told in streaming media in your your
mainstream horror film no characters
have to have a case of the not gays you
can just go ahead and have them have a
case of the gays they're just fucking gay
and you know what
fuck it everybody loves it it's a way to
experiment
like yeah and you don't have that risk
you don't have that risk of
oh god we're putting this in 3 500
theaters
you have to put this element in this
element and take this out yeah you have
to do this and this and our we have to
have all these kind of main characters
and
you can just go you can go off the rails
you can tell whatever kind of story you
want you could cast whoever you want
and it finds its audience it finds its
audience you don't have to worry
that much about the the uh the money
like the market i guess things can flop
on netflix and be bad and
like damage their business you can have
a horrible backlash to something they
put out like that cuties movie
right you got to be careful go too far
but you know
like i you don't have a crazy
nut jobs protesting outside of the
theater
yeah you can't show a lesbian ghost
story in
my amc theater why it's two miles from
my church
you don't have that kind of crap you
just have it you know
and if somebody doesn't want to watch it
you don't got to watch it yeah
so i'm the only the only freedom jay
absolutely the only downside is that
sometimes it can be harder for things to
gain any momentum
or to find things like you might tell
someone like hey have you seen this
movie it's on netflix and they're like
i've never even heard of it
because things just get lost in the
shuffle because there's so much of it
that's why we're here jay sure we're
stuck in this vcr repair shop we got a
streaming television right over there
and in fact we're
we're the heroes heroes work here
put that sign in the vcr window or
embrace your repair shop window
well jay another movie came out an
actual movie that
uh i assume was probably
going to end up in the movie theaters i
don't know
that this was uh the trailer for this
movie came out
and i sent you a message about it i was
like
sasha baron cohen made a secret borat
sequel and not even heard about this
it just showed up one day which was very
exciting
14 years ago i released movie film which
brought great
shame to kazakhstan
well a lot of this movie seems to have
been shot
pre-corona virus i think it's something
he probably started production
coronavirus happens so he just sort of
worked it into the story yeah
which is the advantage of something like
this where you can
and i think in certain cases have to uh
rework your story as you're going along
yeah
um but overall first impressions i was
blindsided by the return of morat
yeah 16 years i think we're on the
record just saying we're fans of sasha
baron cohen
and his awkward uh sometimes horrible
comedy
i yeah i love sasha baron colony makes
me crack up
um from even brothers grimsby
the the dictator bruno all those movies
if it's a hidden camera thing
or a guise of it being a documentary and
you're tricking people
and he's doing these like crazy
characters even when that's not the case
though like brothers grimsby wasn't
that that's that's like a narrative that
was the dictator right the dictator had
some
hidden camera stuff it was mostly
american yeah so yeah but borat was like
the first movie even after two years of
people doing bad borat impressions the
movie itself was still funny
the character is funny i rewatched borat
and it holds up
yeah it holds up i mean i mean he's
talking about
bush and there's a couple dated things
you know obviously the time he filmed it
there's an element of politics to
uh sasha baron cohen's oh sure more so
with this one than the first move
michael bennis
i brought the girl for you the the first
movie is i mean there's some of that but
it's mostly
what works about the characters that
kind of he's
he's naive but he's racist but
when you present that character to
certain people it brings out the worst
in them
i see a lot of people and i think
there's a dead young muslim wonder what
kind of
bomb he's got strapped to him yeah in a
way where you let them dig their own
grave
yeah uh the the most infamous example in
the first movie is
when he's on the busload of the party
bus with the dumb frat boys and they're
saying like all these horrible sexist
things
and it's like he kind of just lets them
talk right he puts them in a position
where
they they think they can talk to this
person uh so openly about these things
because he's this
naive foreign man character they tricked
people in the first one
and this one there's a there's a guy
from kazakhstan he's touring america and
he's making a documentary
you know sign this contract yeah and
there's already people talking about
suing him for this one yeah i know they
tried to assume for the first one too
oh yeah yeah but hidden in the contract
very carefully
by high-powered lawyers is is wording
that
means you are giving away your rights
and you can't
sue and you could try but um so he goes
to this dinner party and
you know he's saying offensive things in
my country
they would go crazy for these two
not so much and they're like oh he's
just a foreigner
but the most i think the most telling
scene from that one was that he's like
well i go
i got to go make toilet okay go upstairs
and he comes down with a bag of poop
and while funny it's like the lady then
takes him upstairs and says
okay the poop goes in the toilet and you
you know you have to wipe yeah and and
the
the mere fact that someone has to feel
like they have to explain that to a
grown adult
from a foreign country shows their
opinion
of people that live in foreign countries
that they they
they are so unsophisticated that they
can't even wipe their own butt
right it's like really really telling
and and
where you don't immediately pick up on
the fact that this is all a ruse
some people should you should know right
away yeah um
which does lead into this movie where i
feel like
way more this is more hit and miss than
the first movie and it feels like
there's a lot of scenarios in this where
he probably had an idea of
how he hoped it would go it didn't go
that way
so then they had to kind of manipulate
it more in editing than the first movie
this felt like way more heavily edited
like again i mentioned that scene with
the
the party bus in the first movie where
those those frat boys are just talking
and you just hold on them
this movie felt like there was lots of
editing lots of
uh like adr or those parts were like
borat or his daughter their faces aren't
facing the camera and they add in lines
there's a big to-do about the rudy
giuliani scene yes
which i don't have any love for rudy
giuliani but that feels i almost feel
bad for him because that is so heavily
manipulated
the layman will watch it and go oh my
gosh you know
uh he was trying to have sex with her or
something but
he does come off bad in that scene but
they they definitely
amp it up with the editor it's it's you
could as editors ourselves we know you
can make
people look terrible you can cut the
cutaways that
maybe they're smiling creepily in a
cutaway
and then you match that with audio that
happened ten minutes ago you know i
i don't know what the daughter said well
she's like let's go into the bedroom and
have a drink
shall we have a drink in the bedroom but
like her backs to the camera
you can give me your phone number and
your address the the
they said that there's something they
had to either get the lav mic
out of his shirt something so people
don't know live mics are hidden through
your shirt
right under your belt in you know in a
pack and so you have to take it out
and he didn't have to i don't know why
he's laying on the bed that's that's
really she probably said why don't you
lay back and i'll pull this cord out
and he had to tuck his shirt in so then
you got a shot of him putting his and
then when they're walking into the
bedroom his back is to the camera and he
goes
let me get your phone number you can
give me your phone number and your
address
oh yeah and that's so it's like i could
have been taken from earlier that audio
felt weird
she's 15 she's too old for you but the
jokes
when he writes the jokes the running of
the americans thing at the end was
hilarious
yes um
his costumes when he goes in with the ku
klux klan outfit
he's the jewish guy going into the
synagogue oh my god
so when he does his bits his bits are
brilliant
um and oh the debutante ball
when she's having her moon blood see
that didn't quite work for me either
that that to me was like there's a
couple parts where it's like like i said
he had an idea of how he thought it
would go but like
that part and like the the mike pence
part when he runs in he's dressed as
donald trump
or as he calls him mcdonald trump which
is why where it's like
okay nothing really happens other than
everybody looks awkward and mike pence
just kind of stares at him and then he
gets escorted out right away
where it's like conceptually i can see
what was supposed to be funny about it
but there's no real uh humor that comes
out of the actual situation other than
the idea
i mean i was a hard a hard get to try
and get into
like a the the what was it the cpac yeah
convention
with a trump costume carrying the lady
over your shoulder
you're not gonna get very far right so i
guess the idea is just the fact that he
got away with it that far
um he tried yeah and there was a couple
of shots with with pence and he's just
like
he's just kind of stairs yeah yeah and i
don't know if that's footage of him
from earlier this is yep
i always think back to that scene at the
rodeo in the first one oh okay he's
getting prepped by like that super old
racist man
and you probably aren't emotional maybe
that's not your name i am a kazakh
i follow the hulk but you look like
i ain't gonna kiss you why not the
people that do the kissing over here are
the ones that float around like that
are they all alone yeah stay away from
them the kids
in my country they take them and they
take them to jail and finish take them
out and hang them
yes that's what we're trying to get done
here high five
and it's like again like i said it lets
people dig their own graves
and this one doesn't have as much of
that there's more like like moments
in the first one where where it's like
oh my god
yes some of these people are real what
did work better in this one though
is the actual story this worked better
as a movie than i think the first one
did
yeah the whole the whole uh relationship
the buddy and relationship between him
and his daughter
actually worked in like a storytelling
movie kind of way it's not the most
original thing but the budding
relationship i thought was good
um the actress that played his daughter
kept up with him
i thought she was great she there's
actually a lot of moments in the movie
some of the best
stuff is the stuff with her that borat's
not even there for
when he takes her to the uh like the
babysitter
who apparently that woman's upset too i
mean i understand what you're saying
that your daddy told you that
yes but that's not the real world i will
touch your vagine
who may yes have i ever touched it yes
yes for even though she comes across
good well that's the thing yeah i read
that but yeah she
she's doing doing all the right things
she's given her advice she's like do you
really want to be sold off to marriage
you're a strong young woman you've got a
smart
mind you could do more and which works
narratively
i thought yeah that's what leads to the
daughter's art yeah i thought she came
off as like
as a really good person so i i think
it's just more the idea that you were
lied to about what the point of the
movie is
so there's that someone should do a
kickstarter to get her a little more
money than
3 000 bucks well it was even less than
that originally the first scene
where bora brings the daughter in i want
to say it was like 300 bucks or
something
um but then there's she shows up again
at the end borat's like will you be my
my black wife or whatever yeah i have a
pain in my
titties because you're giving away your
baby
to do that scene they gave her more
money because it was pandemic times
yeah yeah hollywood isn't isn't keen on
giving away money
but if you say babysitter watch this
guy's 15 year old daughter
we're going to give you 25 000 it might
raise a red flag to her so they have to
pay her
a wage appropriate amount of money for
babysitting somebody but
when the movie comes out as respectable
people
then you give her a little bump and you
say hey sorry we did this to you
you know here's 50 grand thank you yeah
you did a really good job in the movie
that's what i would do
but i'm not a sleazy a hollywood
producer
that's like the how's it the james
cameron titanic thing
the the the the first
officer of the titanic mr murdoch
lightholder was the second officer i
know a lot about the titanic
murdoch murdoch in the movie kills
himself do you remember that part
when first he shoots somebody
and then he's like oh my gosh uh i don't
i i feel so terrible i'm killing myself
that was like some people said that he
shot himself most people said he just
drowned heroically
so then afterwards the the murdoch
family in ireland
was like this is kind of awful
that you portrayed our great great
grandfather in this way he's got
grandchildren he's got a family legacy
he has a foundation
he's kind of famous he was the first
officer on the titanic
and then james cameron was like you're
right here's one thousand dollars
his foundation that was all
i mean i guess it was something shitty
like that okay
and it's like the movie made 197 billion
the biggest movie in the history of
movies
and you exploited this poor man who was
a real life person
who didn't die all that long ago yeah
and uh he made him look bad by murdering
someone and then
killing himself and uh well
here's a thousand bucks so hollywood
they're a bunch of sleaze bags
and that's the one thing that kind of
i'm on the fence about sasha baron cohen
i think he's really funny
at the same time i feel bad for
some of the people that have been
exploited um
the frat guys awful
they come off awful 
"fuck the shit out of her, and then you never call 'em again!"
out of it
yeah and then you never call them again
why you don't call them because they do
not have a telephone yes
no not because of that they don't have
never you know i mean
our country the minorities actually have
more power
anyone that is minority has the the uh
upper hand i'm sure all those guys look
back on that movie now and they're just
like
horribly embarrassed yes and now they're
38 years old and they have
probably have kids and they're different
people they've grown up and
then this is on their this part of their
life forever
a word to the wise never sign a contract
to appear in a documentary
and then and then he goes down to like
the most
the most rural rednecky parts
you know of in the world where
people might not get that this is a guy
from hollywood in a costume yeah you
can't pull that off in new york city or
los angeles they'll be like
yeah which is one of the smart things
they do in this movie is the idea that
borad is now famous
because of the original film so he has
to wear different disguises yes
and that adds to the fun of the movie
stupid foreign
yeah i just remember an old i think it
was ali g
ali g's funny as fuck
i love
i love ali g did a lot of
interviews and and it's just like this
did he interview
trump well my idea is to come out with
just like these ice cream
gloves that make the ice cream not
go on your hands and make it all well
sticky good luck folks it's been nice
seeing you you take care of yourself
where is your going to be in on that
well it sounds like an interest and
trump's like we're done
he just immediately recognizes that this
is bullshit
and that happens a lot and so
you go down to
west virginia how many other girls are
gonna live in here with me
how many uh girls you normally put in a
cage this size
uh one people are just like what
so they kind of answer the question but
they look bad yeah
so sasha baron cohen making people look
bad
uh this one feels sort of sorry for some
of the people
not so sorry for the others yeah this
one like i said more so with this one it
feels like he didn't quite have
as much damning material to work with so
we had to do a lot more manipulation and
editing
and more focus on an actual story i can
open a beer with my small hole
i can't i look we got to be appropriate
and ladylike
okay this is what you're not supposed to
do
um i think most of borat stuff is shot
in romania
because kazakhstan will be like
executing they're not happy with them
so they film in like rural romanian
villages and then the
the ministry office where they show is
like a romanian building
um but kazakhstan is
is a gigantic country oh yeah i i
thought it was small but i never knew
anything about it and i looked it up and
it's it's like the ninth
largest country land-wise in the world
it only has like
18 million people so it's like all
spread out there's a couple of big
cities but it's so
like spread out and rural and um
i was like playing with google maps you
zoom in on these like small
rural cities and some of them have like
like little markers for like businesses
ah
oh boy is it funny a store
crime scenes investigation community
center
keep up the good work not home
good store for your shack
horse cafe auto restoration
service doing a great job grocery store
kazakhstan's second largest grocery
store
very nice kazakhstan's first costco
kazakhstan's biggest movie theater one
screens
cafe cosmodrone now cockroach free
home credit bank most trusted bank in
all of kazakhstan
maximum security prison i mean school
train station greatest museum in all of
kazakhstan
cafe for delivery or takeouts
cafe for hillary clinton's water utility
company
highly rated weapon of mass destruction
monument
five-star hotel
but yeah so so uh sasha baron cohen is
making fun of
uh uneducated redneck whites
in the south primarily yeah uh and then
he's
also on the flip side which is the
controversy with the first one
was all the anti-jewish stuff and of
course sasha baron cohen himself is
jewish
he's making fun of kazakhstanis
uh and their hatred of the jews or just
ignorance of other cultures in general
yeah
specifically that culture um so
he's kind of but it's meant to to
parallel ignorance
in the us and in the way people react
the borax character and it all just
comes down to whether or not you find it
funny and
and why you find it funny i'm sure
there's somebody out there who's
laughing
at the running of the jew in the first
one
in the wrong way the funny part about
you
really that's like the people and this
was a everyone saw it becomes like a
controversy on twitter people start
talking about like
south park they're like south park raise
people to
to uh uh think that cartman is the is a
hero and they
they look up like nobody cartman is a
joke cartman's he's racist
and like like uh borad he makes fun of
jews all the time
nobody looks up to cartman nobody's ever
looked up to cartman
but there's this other side that tries
to act like there are people that
actually
uh think cartman's funny for the wrong
reasons and i think that if there is
it's such a
just like borad it's such a small
minority of people yeah
so that to me is almost like a non-issue
you're laughing
at the ignorance yeah that's the joke
that's the joke is that
borat has his daughter in a cage and all
that
that book that he has her vagina became
very
angry and bit her hand
about not a girl not touching don't
touch your vagina or it'll eat you
yeah and the babies that are reading it
she's like this is not true
right the contrast there of the how
exaggerated that is or how ridiculous
the idea
of that book is and having people try to
react to it
seriously because they think that this
is you know
someone from a foreign country yeah and
so someone might say they're trying to
be polite
that he thinks misogyny is funny and
it's like no
the fact is the joke is that those
things really exist
or have existed right where
misinformation like that
um demonizing people or cultures and
and making fun of that's what he's
making fun of he's not
um he's not doing that as the joke right
so in a way it's a good thing
in a way it can be misleading or
confusing for
people that are dumber well that's yeah
like we talked about the rudy giuliani
scene and now people are
some people are like outraged at rudy
giuliani when it's so
like i don't know someone like you and
me look at it and just it's so clearly
so heavily edited it works as a comedy
scene
in a in a movie like this and it serves
a purpose in the story of this movie
you look at the the the way the footage
is manipulated or the way the scenario
is manipulated
and how heavily edited it is yeah and
it's it's super easy to do
even very subtly like and
and you see it in tv i see it in tv
shows all the time where so
something goes it's like the ending of
chopped you ever watched chopped
oh yeah they always had that dramatic
music it's someone just standing there
i love the salad i almost thought it was
like a black truffle vinaigrette when i
first saw it honestly
little did i know it's blood and
broccoli
i think that you know you just sort of
like warmed up the ribs
they're good but i wish you like
transformed these a bit and just a
little bit more effort into the rib
well they go there uh ted
ted allen is going five four
four three two
one time's up please step back
three and then you cut the footage of
them they're they're oh
they're pouring the thing on at the
three two
one and you know all that happened maybe
30 seconds ago
oh yeah in the in the way it's edited
every single episode of chopped ends
with everybody finishing at the last
possible second
three two one time's up please step back
three two one
time's up three
two one time's up please step back
yes and and and you can
manipulate time you can manipulate
reactions
um someone can go like that to something
and they could be they could have done
it 20 minutes ago to something
else right it's super easy to do and and
and you do it for dramatic purposes like
like chopped yeah and that's that's most
people watch dropped and go oh my god
hurry up
and i'm just like that happened a minute
that happened five minutes ago
sure for that guy over there and you'll
see mistakes too you'll see
that guy over there is on his phone he's
all done with his
his his uh four plates and he's seen him
in the background of a shot
yeah and you catch him there five four
and then two seconds later they're
cutting to him
and he's still plating you know so we
know how it goes
and it all just depends on what is the
end result the end result
it's it's that kind of thing is more
forgiving in yeah like a reality show
or even this movie where it's basically
a comedy
not as forgivable in what's meant to be
like a serious documentary
right right this kind of rides that line
a little bit because he is approaching
it with
sort of a political angle yes so it does
have that questionable aspect to it
that i didn't really get from the first
movie because first movie
isn't as overtly political it's more
just exposing ignorance
yeah if the end result is to make you
laugh i laughed quite a bit
i think i laughed the most at the
debutante ball i think i was more
surprised that that exists
that's still a thing yeah it feels so
antiquated
miss drummond is attending grand canyon
university
where she is double majoring in cage
maintenance and electronics with a focus
on vcr repair but yeah this feels like
a a good borat
sequel it could have come out 10 years
ago it could have come out
two years after borat won that's kind of
nice though that like the first movie
came out
it was a huge hit and everyone was doing
their annoying borat impressions
five-star hotel not
and he didn't immediately it's not like
austin powers where it's like
you gotta make sequel you gotta make
another sequel it's like he let it die
15 years later when no one was expecting
it oh here's a borant sequel yeah
it's uh it's it's it's not as good as
the first one
uh it's a little choppy uh the ending
was was cute
it was a nice way to tie it up yeah made
sense
uh yeah like i said i think it actually
works better as a the first movie is so
flimsy in terms of the story that is
just an excuse to get from one set piece
to the other
and this one the set pieces not all of
them are as strong but the story is
stronger
yeah so it balances out and the the
romanian girl they dug up she was great
yeah
i thought it was just a american actress
doing an
accent she's just a nobody romanian
actress that they plucked out and
probably auditioned a hundred of them
just to say can you ad lib
you know can you do this so i think her
accent might be real
okay um which and and of course you know
if she was someone
sort of famous here she might get
recognized right it's a good
good pick yeah but it's on amazon prime
and it's free
and you don't got to go to a movie
theater
ever again
movie film you pissed me now if he's
still
all right what do you prefer you fixed
me in life you still same time
fist each other yeah there you go
huh why is there a gun on the table
jay do you know anything oh my god
jay's been dead this whole time
i wonder what will happen next
come on come on get it plated
