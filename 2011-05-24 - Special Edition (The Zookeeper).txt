["Half in the bag."]
["Special edition?"]
["Who do these guys think they are, George Lucas?"]
Mike: Hello, and welcome to a special edition of Half in the Bag.
Mike: I'm Mike Stoklasa.
Jay: And I'm Jay Bauman.
Mike: And today we're going to do something a little different.
Mike: We're going to review a short video that Jay discovered on the internet recently.
Jay: Yeah, it's essentially a parody of a real movie trailer, and it's done so brilliantly, you, you can't even tell the difference at all.
Mike: Right.
Mike: It's made to look like some by-the-numbers, big studio, piece of shit movie, but it's done so perfectly.
Jay: Yeah, I can, I can see this fooling a lot of people because of how well it's done.
Jay: But, uh, anyway, I guess we should show people what we're talking about.
Jay: This is the fake trailer for a movie called The Zookeeper.
["Five years later, the world's most devoted zookeeper..."]
["Come on, Donald."]
["Let's move you out of the sun."]
["...is getting a second chance."]
["I hope my baby doesn't make you uncomfortable."]
["I'm not uncomfortable."]
["So comfortable."]
["Ah!"]
["Oh, my god!"]
["No, it's fine, it's fine, I got it."]
["Oh."]
["Ohhhhh, god, it's barbed."
Mike: Oh!
Mike: Wow!
Mike: That's amazing.
Mike: Do you know who made that?
Jay: No idea.
Jay: But what's really impressive about is the fact that they seem to have gotten the real Kevin James to be in it.
Mike: Yeah.
Mike: Or a really good look-alike.
["Really?"]
["I know it shouldn't bother me that you're a zookeeper, but it kind of does."]
["Really?"]
Mike: So they made this trailer look like a bunch of people just got together and said, "We need to plug in all the appropriate elements into a movie to make dumb people go see it in droves."
Jay: Yeah, the cliches in it are so laughably bad, but it's so close to reality.
Jay: It's right on the line there.
Jay: I could see this being an actual movie, sadly enough.
Mike: Eh, for me, it goes a little too far in the stupid department.
["How long's it been able to talk?"]
["Let's see."]
["Today is Tuesday, so, um, always."]
["You're the best zookeeper we ever had!"]
Jay: They did hit all the right marks, though.
Mike: Yes, yes.
Jay: I can see this being a movie that tons of fat idiot retards just flock to and enjoy.
Mike: There's a lot of them out there.
Jay: Like, you've got the, uh, the lovable schlubby guy with a woman that's way out of his league.
Jay: You've got talking animals, for no apparent reason.
Jay: Uh, it's got really awful unfunny physical comedy.
["Oh, crud."]
Jay: Like, it just hits all those notes.
Mike: It even has that, like, obvious boyfriend character that's going to be the competition, and he's like, you know.
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: It's like...by the numbers.
Jay: It's perfect, yeah.
Mike: Um, cliches aside, there's, there's some general dumbness in the trailer.
Jay: Some?
Mike: Well, there's, there's, there's one part that stuck out where Kevin James is being taught how to release his inner bear.
["You need to unlock your inner bear."]
["Rawr..."]
["Wh-, wh-, wh-, no, no."]
["Roar!"]
Mike: And, and there's apparently no jokes in that scene.
Mike: It's just him growling and going "Wguguuuuh!"
["Yeah."]
["That's good!"]
Mike: It's so horrible.
Mike: I mean, if this were a real movie, it would be so embarrassing for anyone involved in it.
Jay: Right.
Jay: I don't even think that Kevin James would be in a movie this bad--
Mike: No.
--in real life.
["Are you okay?"]
["Yeah, yeah..."]
Mike: Like, it comes off like one of those movies, like, late in someone's career, like, I'm just desperate for money--
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: --kind of thing.
Mike: And anyone who's an actor with any kind of integrity would not star in this film.
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: Unless they're just a horrible sellout.
Mike: Um, and I don't know that much about Kevin James.
Mike: I know he was in Paul Blart: Mall Cop.
Jay: And that says it all, doesn't it?
Jay: Well, it's kind of nice that he's able to poke fun at that image by doing this--
Mike: Yeah.
Jay: --by doing this parody trailer.
Mike: Yeah, yeah.
Mike: Because I think it really is him in the trailer.
["Wow, not cool!"]
Mike: Yeah, maybe he did it on the weekend, and they thought it was like a funny thing, and he was poking fun at himself.
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: Like, this is a movie I could potentially star in, you know?
Jay: Right.
Jay: I never would, so...
Mike: Yeah, yeah.
Jay: ...but I have enough sense of humor about the dumb movies I've made that...
Mike: Right.
Mike: Exactly.
["Kevin James..."]
["The best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female."]
["Come on, soar like an eagle!"]
Mike: There's also a brilliant product placement gag in this trailer.
Jay: Yeah, yeah.
Jay: All those, those real Adam Sandler movies have some sort of whorish product tie-in, with like a restaurant chain--
Mike: Yeah.
Jay: --or some sort of product.
Mike: Yeah.
Jay: So the fact that they included that in this is, like, perfect.
Mike: Yeah, yeah.
Mike: There's a, there's a talking gorilla in the movie.
Mike: And for no apparent reason he says he loves TGI Fridays, or that he wants to go to TGI Fridays.
Jay: Yeah.
["Is TGI Fridays as incredible as it looks."]
["It's pretty good."]
Mike: And, and then it, and then later on, he goes to TGI Fridays.
Mike: And, and that's the joke?
Jay: Well, he goes, he sees the TGI Fridays, and he goes, "Shut up."
Mike: Like, yeah, yeah.
Jay: Like, in awe.
["Shut up."]
Jay: I'm picturing, like, retarded people in the theater just laughing hysterically because they've heard of TGI Fridays.
Mike: Yeah.
Mike: And the fact that that, uh, gorilla wants to go there.
Jay: That's also the scene where the gorilla is in the car dancing to that hip-hop song that was popular, like, three years ago.
Mike: Yes, yes.
Mike: The apple bottom jeans song.
Jay: Yes.
["Apple bottom jeans"]
["Jeans"]
["Boots with the fur"]
["The fur"]
Mike: It's always, like, a dated song.
Mike: Slightly dated.
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: And it's, and it's perfect.
Mike: The apple bottom jeans son is perfect.
Mike: And one thing it was missing is, they really should have had one of the animals log into his myspace account, just, just to make it, just perfectly dated.
Jay: Yeah.
Jay: I, I was a little disappointed that the, the fake trailer didn't have either a fart joke or, like, a kick to the crotch.
Mike: Yeah.
Mike: Right.
Jay: It was also missing, like, a wacky sidekick.
Mike: Mm-hmm.
Jay: Like, a zookeeper sidekick character to Kevin James, played by, like, I don't know, like Justin Long.
Mike: Yeah.
Jay: Or like a rapper.
Jay: Like that would have been, that would have been perfect.
Mike: Mm, yeah.
Mike: Well, in order for the gag to work, though, you probably would have had to get the real actor, you know, so maybe they couldn't--
Jay: Maybe they couldn't get somebody.
Mike: Maybe, maybe it was just a thing where, whoever made this knew Kevin James, and had him for a weekend or something like that.
Jay: Yeah, yeah.
Mike: You know, so, like, it would have been perfect have like Ludacris in there, you know, or someone like that, like--
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: --as the wacky...
Jay: Wisecracking sidekick.
Mike: Wisecracking sidekick, who you wouldn't think works in a zoo..
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: ...but does!
["Zookeeper"]
Mike: And they even got the font right.
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: You know, the shiny, semi-reflective, embossed, pastel-colored, 3D, soft-beveled font.
Mike: The kind that looks like candy!
Mike: It just makes you want to eat it!
["She hit the floor"]
["She hit the floor"]
Mike: So, Jay, how does this fake trailer compare to other recent fake trailers?
Jay: Like what?
Mike: You know, uh, Old Dogs...
["Penguins!"]
Mike: Grown-Ups...
Mike: Furry Vengeance...
["I'm gonna find you"]
["I'm gonna get ya get ya get ya"]
Jay: Mike, those were real movies.
Mike: What?
Mike: Yes?
Mike: Thank you.
Mike: Um, The Zookeeper is a real movie.
Mike: I'll go first.
