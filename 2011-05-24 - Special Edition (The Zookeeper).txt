PLINKETT:
Half in the bag.
Special Edition?
Who do these guys think they are?
George Lucas?

MIKE:
Hello, and welcome to a special edition of Half in the Bag.
I'm Mike Stoklasa.

JAY:
And I'm Jay Bauman.

MIKE:
And today we're going to do something a little different.
We're going to review a short video that, uh, Jay discovered on the internet recently.

JAY:
Yeah.
It's essentially a parody of a real movie trailer.
And it's done so brilliantly, you, you can't even tell the difference at all.

MIKE:
Right.
It's made to look like some by-the-numbers, big studio, piece of shit movie.
But it's done so perfectly.

JAY:
Yeah.
I can, I can see this fooling a lot of people because of how well it's done.
But, uh, anyway, I guess we should show people what we're talking about.
This is the fake trailer for a "movie" called "The Zookeeper".

VOICEOVER:
Five years later, the world's most devoted zookeeper...

GRIFFIN KEYES:
Come on, Donald.
Let's move you out of the sun.

VOICEOVER:
Is getting a second chance.

STEPHANIE:
I hope my baby doesn't make you uncomfortable.

GRIFFIN KEYES:
I'm not uncomfortable.
So comfortable.
Aughhh!

STEPHANIE:
Oh, my god!

GRIFFIN KEYES;
No, it's fine, it's fine, I got it.
Oh.
Oh, god.
It's barbed.

MIKE:
Oh!
Wow!
That's amazing.
Do you know who made that?

JAY:
No idea.
But what's really impressive about is the fact that they seem to have gotten the real Kevin James to be in it.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Or a really good look-alike.

GRIFFIN KEYES
Really?

STEPHANIE:
I know it shouldn't bother me that you're a zookeeper.
But it kind of does.

GRIFFIN KEYES:
Really?

MIKE:
So they made this trailer look like a bunch of people just got together and said:
"We need to plug in all the appropriate elements into a movie to make dumb people go see it in droves."

JAY:
Yeah.
The cliches in it are so laughably bad.
But it's so close to reality.
It's right on the line there.
I could see this being an actual movie, sadly enough.

MIKE:
Ehh, for me, it goes a little too far in the stupid department.

GRIFFIN KEYES:
How long's it been able to talk?

DONALD THE MONKEY:
Let's see.
Today is Tuesday.
So, um...always.

BRUCE THE BEAR:
You're the best zookeeper we ever had!

JAY:
They did hit all the right marks, though.

MIKE:
Yes, yes.

JAY:
I can see this being a movie that tons of fat idiot retards just flock to and enjoy.

MIKE:
There's a lot of 'em out there.

JAY:
Like, you've got the, uh, the lovable schlubby guy with a woman that's way out of his league.
You've got talking animals for no apparent reason.
Uh, it's got really awful, unfunny physical comedy.

DONALD THE MONKEY:
Oh, crud.

JAY:
Like, it just hits all those notes.

MIKE:
It even has that, like, obvious boyfriend character that's going to be the competition.
And he's like, you know...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's like...by the numbers.

JAY:
It's perfect, yeah.

MIKE:
Um, cliches aside, there's, there's some general dumbness in the trailer.

JAY:
Some?

MIKE:
Well, there's, there's, there's one part that stuck out where Kevin James is being taught how to release his inner bear.

BRUCE THE BEAR:
You need to unlock your inner bear.

GRIFFIN KEYES:
Rawr...

BRUCE THE BEAR:
Wh-, wh-, wh-, no, no.
Roar!

MIKE:
And, and there's apparently no jokes in that scene.
It's just him growling and going:
"Wguguuuuh!"

GRIFFIN KEYES:
Yeah.

BRUCE THE BEAR:
That's good!

MIKE:
It's so horrible.
I mean, if this were a real movie, it would be so embarrassing for anyone involved in it.

JAY:
Right.
I don't even think that Kevin James would be in a movie this bad...

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
In real life.

STEPHANIE:
Are you okay?

GRIFFIN KEYES:
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

MIKE:
Like, it comes off like one of those movies, like, late in someone's career, like:
"I'm just desperate for money."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Kind of thing.
And anyone who's an actor with any kind of integrity would not star in this film.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Unless they're just a horrible sellout.
Um, and I don't know that much about Kevin James.
I know he was in Paul Blart: Mall Cop.

JAY:
That says it all, doesn't it?

MIKE:
So, yeah.
He's cashing paychecks.

JAY:
Well, it's kind of nice that he's able to poke fun at that image by doing this...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
This parody trailer.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.
Because I think it really is him in the trailer.

CAR SALESMAN:
Wow!
Not cool!

MIKE:
Yeah.
Maybe he did it on the weekend, and they thought it was like a funny thing, and he was poking fun at himself.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like:
"This is a movie I could potentially star in, you know?"

JAY:
Right.
"I never would, so..."

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
"But I have enough sense of humor about the dumb movies I've made that..."

MIKE:
Right.
Exactly.

VOICEOVER:
Kevin James...

JANET THE LIONESS:
The best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female.

BARRY THE ELEPHANT:
Come on, soar like an eagle!

MIKE:
There's also a brilliant product placement gag in this trailer.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.
All those, those real Adam Sandler movies have some sort of whorish product tie-in, with like a restaurant chain, or some sort of product.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So the fact that they included that in this is, like, perfect.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.
The, there's, there's a talking gorilla in the movie.
And for no apparent reason, he says he loves TGI Fridays, or that he wants to go to TGI Fridays.

JAY:
Yeah.

BERNIE THE GORILLA:
Is TGI Fridays as incredible as it looks?

GRIFFIN KEYES:
It's pretty good.

MIKE:
And, uh, and then, and then later on, he goes to TGI Fridays.
And, and that's the joke?

JAY:
Well, he goes, he sees the TGI Fridays, and he goes:
"Shut up."

MIKE:
Like, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Like, in awe.

BERNIE THE GORILLA:
Shut up.

JAY:
I'm picturing, like, retarded people in the theater just laughing hysterically because they've heard of TGI Fridays.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And the fact that that, uh, gorilla wants to go there.

JAY:
That's also the scene where the gorilla is in the car dancing to that hip-hop song that was popular, like, three years ago.

MIKE:
Yes, yes.
The apple bottom jeans song.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
It's always, like, a dated song.
Slightly dated.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it's, and it's perfect.
The apple bottom jeans sonG is perfect.
And one thing it was missing is, they really should have had one of the animals log into his myspace account.
Just, just to make it, just perfectly dated.

JAY:
Yeah.
I, I was a little disappointed that the, the fake trailer didn't have either a fart joke or, like, a kick to the crotch.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right.

JAY:
It was also missing, like, a wacky sidekick.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, a zookeeper sidekick character to Kevin James, played by, like, I don't know, like Justin Long.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Or like a rapper.
Like, that would have been, that would have been perfect.

MIKE:
Mm, yeah.
Well, in order for the gag to work, though, you probably would have had to get the real actor, you know?
So maybe they couldn't...

JAY:
Maybe they couldn't get somebody.

MIKE:
Maybe, maybe it was just a thing where, whoever made this knew Kevin James, and had him for a weekend or something like that.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
You know, so, like, it would have been perfect have like Ludacris in there or, you know, or someone like that, like...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
As the wacky...

JAY:
Wisecracking sidekick.

MIKE:
Wisecracking sidekick, who you wouldn't think works in a zoo..

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But does!

VOICEOVER:
Zookeeper!

MIKE:
And they even got the font right.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You know, the shiny, semi-reflective, embossed, pastel-colored, 3D, soft-beveled font.
The kind that looks like candy!
It just makes you want to eat it!

MIKE:
So, Jay, how does this fake trailer compare to other recent fake trailers?

JAY:
Like what?

MIKE:
You know, uh, Old Dogs.

CHARLIE:
Penguins!
Aww...

MIKE:
Grown-Ups.
Furry Vengeance.

JAY:
Mike...
Those were real movies.

MIKE:
What?
Yes?
Thank you.
Um, The Zookeeper is a real movie.
I'll go first.
