you don't just pull a giant snowmaker machine out of your ass= in the third act right jay
in the modern era of movies you do
yeah things just show up
yeah
what's that
hey there's wonder woman's golden suit
they they talk actually they jay they did talk about wonder woman's golden suit
when little diana loses her um her her uh american ninja warrior competition
mm-hmm
she's very sad and she's sitting in the arena and all the the amazonian warriors go up to a statue
and they're like that's our most proudest warrior and which turns out to be linda carter
yeah
at the end
in the post-credits sequence
and when when humans tried to invade their island once she fought them all off with the golden suit of armor
and and she's our most proudest warrior
and and then
but then they never said like how diana got it
yeah
apparently it was shipped to her
uh when when wonder woman uses the suit even though we got this incorrect in our half in the bag her power she already had her powers back so the suit is completely pointless
yeah
all she's doing is fighting a cgi cat lady
yeah there's no high stakes there can
can we talk about this for just one
second and i want you to include this
even though we're talking about the blob
and i know you're thinking i'm gonna cut
this
no i'm not actually okay uh because
we're talking about the difference
between the
movie like this structure versus
wonderful yeah but i also want to just
um
elaborate a little more on our wonder
woman discussion
because we often and this is this is
where i'm i'm
fully prepared to admit that you and i
are wrong
on a certain level we hate movie
theaters yes because movie theaters
often have slobs in them
and annoying people and awful things
happen yeah but the little skit that we
did at the end of half in the bag
where we are distracted by things going
on
in the house is also true
oh sure
and the luxury of pausing a movie
walking away from it
doing some laundry while it's on like
when you get bored
when you're in the movie theater you are
locked in and even if there is
like a fat guy eating a hot dog in your
ear
yeah you're locked in on that screen
which makes us less likely to miss
things
i remember when wonder woman
was saying goodbye to chris pine yeah
i wasn't in the room okay
i i was like they're talking about
something
the point being like if it was a good
movie and you were engaged by the story
you would not be distracted by
everything around me sure with the blob
i i i focused sure because we're doing a
review and i've seen the movie a bunch
but i haven't seen it in a very long
time yeah
um but with wonder woman yeah i was i
was in and out
because i was got so bored yeah but also
my confusion
came when i thought she hadn't renounced
her wish
i'll always love you diana no matter
where i am
because why else would you show up to
fight
cat lady covered in a suit of armor
unless you had a weakness
unless you were vulnerable to attack
that's how you structure your story yeah
yeah and so
it's like and then she's like okay i
have to fight the cat lady but i don't
want to yet renounce
my wish for chris pine and then when all
the [ __ ] hit the fan and she realized
that all those wishes have to be
renounced in order to stop donald trump
i mean
uh max power powers
uh i better wear this golden suit of
armor to protect my weak ass
from the cat lady and then there's that
triumphant moment where she's like [ __ ]
the suit of
armor yeah
it's structured like she's regaining her
powers there yes so
maybe it was a thing in post-production
where they
because there's a moment where she's
like they show her and it looks like
she's thinking
yeah yeah why
why not renounce your wish during the
fight
yeah because that would seem like the
point of the golden armor
anyways we've we've sidetracked but we
want to clarify some things
it is yeah we can admit that we weren't
paying full attention to the film but
that is our fault
yeah um but when you have a solidly
structured movie with a story that
you're engaged in
you don't lose interest quite as easily
