no no
oh god damn it oh [ __ ] come on
that's the last [ __ ] straw
is your nft doing that bad no i was just sick and tired of hearing about amber heard and johnny depp
shut the [ __ ] up about it already johnny's suing amber i hadn't heard that
he's suing her for defamation i heard it was because of defecation
defamation causes defecation which causes defamation
and it's gripped the nation i hope none of the monitor went into my coffee
i hope it did so did you see any good movies this year we're back for another catch-up episode i guess we saw films in
2022 it's it's uh nearing june the halfway mark of 2022
and uh instead of watching the batman i'm never ever gonna watch that ever
ever gonna watch the batman that's become like i remember do you remember the boondock saints do you remember that
film i've never seen it i heard it's a dude bro douchebag movie i've never seen it because
when i think it bombed in theaters but it was on video there's so many people dude you guys see do boom ducks saying she's got like the
dude unboxing the dude box saints all the people that recommended that movie to me were so obnoxious about it
that i intentionally avoided it and now we have that same situation with the batman dude you understand it's not like
other comic book movies it's not like a batman movie like but it literally is a batman movie
it might be great i'm never going to see it ever out of spite
despite going to your grave without seeing robert pence that's going to go on my tombstone he never saw the batman the
batman don't forget to like and subscribe and post a comment on what you'd like us
to review next are guaranteed to listen if we get to a hundred thousand likes
we'll watch the batman oh yeah yeah yeah i said we'll watch it we'd have to talk
about in a video how about a hundred thousand comments what if we instead of 100
because this will be easier to keep track of because we can pin a comment like one of our own comments under the video oh okay so we'll pin
we'll watch the batman if this comment gets to a hundred thousand uh likes yes
yes yes and if that comment the pinned comment at the top of the comment page yes gets to a hundred thousand because
can you like a comment yeah oh so all you have to do is like the comment i didn't know this yes this is rarely on
youtube uh so if you like the comment that says we will watch the batman and it gets to a hundred thousand likes we will watch
the batman watching the batman not guaranteed um but it it'll happen so click that like button smash that like
button smack that like button i heard darth vader's coming back oh
great he's coming back again in the only one kenobi show with darth vader it's
really hard to smash a big lump of darth vader wax but you know what i'm gonna do
it i'm gonna do it oh that was weird
what happened nothing it fell on the floor oh probably because you knocked it down there
yeah i saw there was like some big article that came out yesterday about the future of lucasfilm and like a big retrospective on kathleen kennedy and
their plans for star wars and i didn't even click on it i don't care vanity fair does their big like they get annie
leibowitz they take her out of her coffin and they wheel her onto this because she's a vampire uh and they
wheel her out she's on she's on like a dolly like like hannibal lecter okay and and uh she hasn't seen all these tubes
going yeah and she has an assistant that holds her camera in and she has like a little like
little clicker and she's on the dolly and she's got the hannibal lecter like like face mask on
so she doesn't bite someone's ear off and then annie annie how would you like everyone to stand well
everyone will be slightly spaced apart in a big wide format photograph oh yeah
and everyone will go remember that photograph for the dark
universe did they wheel out old annie for that probably i want annie leibowitz to take
a picture of you me and rich like like we'll get the half in the bag
set right yeah and when she'll get her wide format picture it'll be like the threefold in
vanity fair and it'll just be you me and rich and we'll all be separated just
enough arm's length because star wars is just a a big like
pile of of human feces and so they're trying to make it look like something fancy yeah and it's like no it's not
it's not high art well it's like you were talking about picard how it's like reviewing it now is like reviewing any
random show that's how i feel about star wars it's like being excited about the next season ncis like it's just a show
who cares anymore yeah it's just a product there's like gonna be like three new shows ashoka
ahsoka yeah is that how you say it yeah oh i don't know but she's gonna have her own show and then baby yoda has a show
well that's the mandalorian right now there's a there's a coming of age story and i think it's about baby yoda oh
what about yaddle what are they gonna bring back yaddle uh yeah damn it
so justice for yaddle forget about justice for johnny i can't keep up with all these shows hashtag justice for
there's there's so many marvel and star wars shows i just can't keep up i just don't get now they're star trek shows
too everyone says to watch strange new worlds they say it's not
that bad it's like the difference between having stage four and stage one cancer it's
like stage one's better than stage four that's what they should have called it
stage one cancer that's just star trek state cancer okay yeah
anyways we're not here to talk about the endless marvel and star wars products that are available for consumption no
we're here to talk about all the shows that netflix has canceled netflix just laid off 150 employees i
know netflix is going down now we'll never get to see anti-racist baby we've been deprived of anti-racist
babies what is that about other than an anti-racist baby i think i think it's all there in the title i don't know are
they are they going to release an episode of stranger things every six months to keep people subscribed keep coming back
i know this season that's coming out they're releasing in two parts like one's that's become a thing though yeah
i think it's gonna become a thing splitting a a series into a season into two mini seasons i should just release
them every like week i mean like i used to be for a while i was all on
board with the dump it all at once and i'm kind of past that now i kind of like the the like releasing an episode once a
week i do too um it keeps you more engaged you watch them all at once and it's like it washes over you and you
forget about it sooner that's kind of happened with the first thing we're going to talk about severance
oh okay yeah we're getting right off on track here we're gonna talk about severance the best goddamn show i've
seen in a very long time yes but but your your caveat here is that it washed
over you now no i guess that's a bad segue they release it once a week so it's the opposite of that okay so
everything i just said i mean the opposite sounded like a setup for the fact that severance has washed over your brain no
it has not no it stuck with me partially well one because it's really good but also because they were releasing it
weekly ironically you did not forget severance exactly every time you find yourself here it's
because you chose to come back well jay tell our audience about
severance one of the very few good shows on apple plus i think that's the biggest detriment of the show if it was
somewhere else it would be getting way more attention than it has although for apple tv plus it's gotten a decent
amount of attention but it deserves a lot more because it's really really good very sort of weird
and mildly comical but not doesn't push it too far each of these is
a real smile and they rotate these through the true number of smiles may well be in
the millions yeah i don't even know if i'd call it a black comedy or a sci-fi series or a horror series or a drama
series it's sort of like a little piece of everything all in one and it's in a way that works that doesn't turn into just
mush it's a little mind [ __ ] a little because it starts off as this concept
uh the concept is you can have your brain severed where you you once you come to this work
this job you don't remember who you were outside of the job and vice versa so once you
get in this elevator they do a hitchcock zoom in pull out and then you go
and then you and this company is very strange so when these people come to
work adam scott and uh john tuturo and uh lady who was really good i don't know
who later and then the other guy i don't know the actors names but they come to work and i guess they're that part of their brain
that that says this job is so [ __ ] weird is gone too yeah they're in the
department of data refinement something like that right it seems completely nonsensical yeah there's like numbers
they have old old uh retro computers yeah and they're they're retro futurism
is that a term yes it is i think um but uh so they're on the computers and there's numbers and they're like you got
to take the numbers and put them in these little folders it's like intuitive like you'll know when to click on this
one it makes noise it's very like spike jonesy yeah that aspect of it as it goes on
the the aspect of the business gets weirder and weirder and more like bizarre and they find a
room with goats in it and and these weird little like celebrations if you reach a certain goal
at your job you can have like a pancake party or a waffle party or whatever yeah and uh it's like looking at a m.c escher
painting where it's like you recognize things that look right but and in a way they're wrong you know what
i mean well that's the thing is everybody's essentially playing two characters because you see they're outside well innies and audis they call
them they're basically two disconnected characters and adam scott's great with that because he's his backstory is really sad and on
the outside world he's really depressed which is kind of why he wanted to take this job where he could just disconnect for eight hours
and the the the complete difference in his performance inside and out is
is like perfect yeah it's subtle but but very effective because you could just see the change he's a little
he's a he's like talks different he's more like mumbly outside yeah yeah he's
yeah and inside he has a little more confidence because he his wife died that's one of the plot points
um and it's not really a spoiler um and that's why he wants to sever he
tried to go back to teaching and he just couldn't do it so um but there's a more nefarious uh plot
going on with the severance you know leader like it's almost cultish yeah and so you're like what's going on what's
going on and then there's some the ending of the season it's just fantastic you're just like hooked it's
one of those things where we've talked about like limited series how it just feels like a long movie but this is one of those things where you get to the end
and you're like oh no now i gotta wait for another season yes and that's that is where it gets
dangerous i trust this show and it's it's smartness to continue on
in a good path but i've i won't name the shows but i'm on i've started seasons
two of shows and stopped yeah um because i'm like
i got what i wanted from season one i'm out that's my fear of this show is
because i've been i've been completely desensitized to ongoing mysterious tv shows thanks to
lost that ruined my faith in anything ever so it's like that fear of like if severance keeps going like as it's gonna
be another lost or they just keep introducing new mysterious weird things and the the
uh conclusions to them get less and less satisfying so far though as one season of tv
severance is great it's important your eyes be kind do you know how to make your eyes kind of
on a beautiful day
if if we're going to bring off lost i will bring up a show called from
[ __ ] love it but i'm a little concerned about the lost effect because i think some people
from lost are involved in it or something one of the actors is yeah but it has that feel where it's like
compounding mysteries um both with their setting the premise of the show which was what intrigued me
is uh people get trapped in this like small town it's barely a town there's like five buildings a little diner
a police station a couple of houses and uh you can't leave and people have
gotten stuck there from all over the us they're just on a road trip and they just find themselves stuck in this town
they're like how the hell did you get here from wherever and they don't even know where they're at right and it's like if you try and leave if you keep
driving you just end up at the start of town on top of that is
uh when the sun goes down you have to be indoors and you have to have a talisman
like a rune kind of covered rock that they found hanging on the
window of your house to ward off these monsters that come out at night and they are monsters they're
like vampires they look like when they show their true form they look like nosferatu vampires like big teeth
but they look like dead people at first and they try to lure you out of your house or let you in
come here come inside it's me grandma and it's like a ghost and the little girl's like hi grandma i missed you
the very very stephen king-ish i'm so lonely baby
please just maybe i can come in
very stephen king and uh one of the first episodes they there's like a mother and a daughter
and the husband goes off and he gets drunk at a bar and he forgets to go home and the girl lets the demon in
and they show full-on little
eight-year-old girls ripped apart corpse oh my god and the mother too but i'm like they don't show
her getting killed but they come in the room and they're like oh there's that little girl from five minutes ago and her entire like chest cavities ripped
open jesus and it's like whoa it really sets the stage for how like
vicious and awful these monsters are it's almost necessary okay um but it's creepy and um
very uh engaging and there's all these wonderful different characters all over the
season there's like a guy who's like like tony stark meets elon musk he's like a tech guru
like super smart guy who gets trapped in the town and um
he's helping this other guy or main character who's an engineer he is he's an engineer who builds roller coasters
okay so it's just like random people that's yeah that's he's like you never see that as a character yeah he's like he's like i'm an engineer but i build
roller coasters he's like okay well you're the second smartest person in this town next to me i'm a tech
genius and so they build like a radio tower to try to transmit uh like it's
it's that premise that i love where people are trapped yeah and they all have to work together to figure out a
solution continuing on
with our lost discussion and extremely disappointing endings ozark
oh did ozark suck at the end it dropped the ball like it was made
not just of lead but a condensed neutron star that weighs 150 billion times the weight
of our entire solar system wow that ball there went through our earth and it punched a
hole in the space-time continuum i'm just sick of having blood on my hands wendy
it doesn't bother you that's my fear when everyone says like you gotta watch breaking bad you gotta watch mad men you gotta watch one of these like long
running shows it's like ah game of thrones everyone was all about game of thrones then the last season
comes out and it sucks so bad or i'm like oh well i'm glad i didn't invest the time in that you know ozark i i will
give it a pass because 95 of it was excellent and engaging and
the performances jason bateman so good in it everybody's so good in it laura linney
um and it's just like they just didn't know how to end it yeah
it was kind of like the last season or even the second half of the last season where it's just like
we're like oh god we don't know what to do yeah and i'm sitting there like you did you could have just done this you
could have just done this could it let's just say i don't i don't know if this is spoilers if it is
shut it off if you care it ends with gunshot fade to black oh no
yeah the like a cliche yeah uh and it doesn't even make a whole lot of sense and you're like that's the ending of
this show yikes but uh the show is so good up until that point okay i will tell you this though breaking bad ends
pretty well it's worth the watch same with mad men they both they both conclude fine those
are more i've heard they end fine i'm just it's just there's so many seasons of it it's like oh that's such a commitment breaking bad is is is a
developing every every season it develops yeah it doesn't feel like it's
spinning its wheels you watch walter white a mild-mannered uh
chemistry teacher turn into a a horrible monster
and his transformation is slow yeah and uh there's and there's pivotal points
throughout it when he does something even worse than what he did before
to keep this it's very ozark where it's like every season just things get more and more complicated it's very
breaking bad where the characters especially his wife wendy she becomes more and more like
corrupt power hungry and he's just trying to keep things even
keel and get them out without getting killed and they get involved in all these different drug organizations and
all these different like you know ties to this and that and it becomes this like tangled web
and uh so many people die because of their actions and their and then they just
spiral out of control they open a casino riverboat casino to launder money just all sorts of crazy [ __ ] happens but
it's just really like well done and it sounds goofy but it's like it was was smart
but that that and they didn't know how to end it they didn't really know how to end it and what they chose out of a list
of 65 different possibilities was the the the bottom of the barrel yeah so
it's very sad but i i still love the show so that's a show that ended this year so
it's technically in 2022. sure but uh check out from
check out severance and if you're watching this in the future i'm so sorry that they both went to [ __ ]
because then there's other shows like i watched if we're still talking about shows archive 81 on netflix which was a
decent show uh had a premise of a guy who has to restore vhs tapes i've seen
the trailer high eight tapes is like oh that's right up our alley and it's very like slow building and atmosphere looks
like a horror movie it's yeah it's it's very but it's it's got a really slow build to it but then occasionally
they'll be like a cgi creature that looks stupid kind of takes you out of it but the overall and then like it's
partially found footage because you're seeing what he's the footage he's restoring and it's not great but it was relatively
engaging but then it ends with a big cliffhanger for season two and then netflix didn't renew it and it's just
done oh so that's that i mean don't waste your time on it even
though it was okay because it's gonna go nowhere show's being canceled this is not a new concept of streaming though i
remember the first time i found out a show didn't continue was alf the the because they didn't know if
they're going to get renewed for another season so it ends on a cliffhanger where alf is surrounded by all these fbi guys
and i was like oh no elf and that was just the end of the series did you cry yourself to sleep in your
college dorm pour one out for ralph buddies at the frat party i was too distraught to go to
the frat party oh okay okay you didn't you didn't pour a 40 out for elf no and
then get [ __ ] wasted i just cried into my elf pillow i cried into my star wars pillow and
they killed han solo i think you're gonna say you cried in
your star wars pillow when they killed star wars oh yeah i don't have that many pillows
this is for you
watching the new kids in the hall i guess yeah brief mention of kids in the hall it's great
who are you people i love kids in the hall you know a lot of their skits are hit and miss
for me it's like a yeah russian roulette six three bullets and a six chamber gun it's
like half and half the time i guess that's a bad analogy well the thing i think i like it sounds like
you're killing yourself um in this case a bullet to the head is good yeah well my favorite stuff from
the original series is the more kind of filmic cinematic sketches
he's got my pen
some of it is just just filmed like a generic sitcom or something like an audience and so the new show is all
cinematic stuff pretty much yeah there seems to be a i'm not that familiar with kids in the hall but i'm watching this because i'm
like interesting i've seen some old stuff i'm like why don't i watch this uh and it's a mixed bag of styles of
sketch comedy um like you said anti-humor weird stuff
but then there's like more traditional stuff that feels kind of like improv or a very scriptedy improv and
i'm like no but then there's bizarre stuff my favorite bit was the shakespeare bust
i was gonna mention that one yeah
uh genius and then the 60 and on the poll like that like a great
comedy setup uh that's that has like punches lots of good little bits within
an already funny premise that's so hot
and they didn't and one that's self-deprecating the show is very
self-deprecating about the fact that they're all old though yes you got to do that humor
humorists are often self-deprecating the first five minutes of the show is them just making fun of their
failed movie right that's funny brain candy has made its money back i
knew it would you know i thought it would take a week wound up taking 30 years well you're
never wrong don and they bring back uh don roerder is his name he's the the guy in the towel no not no that's that's
bellini the the don reuter is like the the owner of the company where he's like they're bringing back the kids in the hall oh yeah he's basically because the
original show and this one was produced by lauren michaels so he's doing a lauren michael's impression and he did that in brain candy before mike myers
did it with dr evil look are we ever going to get the big table in here or do i have to go ahead and cut down that [ __ ] tree myself
yeah kids in the hall eight episodes it seems to elude at the end that they're gonna do more which would be nice
they haven't haven't uh missed a beat those kids in the hall they're still very funny
hilarious what else you got i got the opposite of
hilarious and i can't talk about it too much because i only watched one episode and i was done
mike myers everyone's favorite 90s comedian who hasn't been relevant in 20 years he's back baby he's 90
with a netflix series called the pen tavern which is a reference to an offhand joke and so i married an axe
murderer who is he creating a cinematic universe i guess he's bringing that back
because he cannot let a bit die i'm being sent to dubrovnik i repeat
sent to dubrovnik what's the brovnik is that a euphemism for being probed in your no-no hole uh this is like all the
worst i like mike myers i love wayne's worlds i love uh austin powers but after
that he kind of he like this show is like his worst impulses it's like i'm gonna play
every character and i'm gonna constantly laugh at my own jokes and you know the the the kind of word
play he does with like uh i don't know when everyone's seen the rocket in the sky in the austin powers
movie and it's just euphemisms for dicks it has that stuff and it's just it feels so tired
not tonight dear i've got a headache a stuffed steer whereas like i can't do
it i'm sorry mike myers i'm done with you that's right up my alley you were stretching it with the third austin
powers movie as far as like doing the same shtick i'm done with it maybe you'll like it more but i was just
the weirdest thing is because it's like he plays the penthavert is like the secret organization and there's whatever
six seven people that are the heads of it and he plays almost all of them except for keegan michael key
who's surprisingly unfunny on it i like him in general but nobody's funny on it even the characters mike myers are
playing it's just the fact that he's wearing makeup and doing a funny voice like that's the extent of the joke
you'll need to rest for tomorrow you have initiator and you must focus what
i will not do that you must [ __ ] us very hard if you just can't get enough of mike myers doing a funny voice
well what are our television recommendations jay
severance and that's it severance ghost adventures there's a new episode
coming out tomorrow i feel like there's always a new episode coming out tomorrow uh oh my once
favorite ghost show a haunting has gone downhill so bad i didn't even
know that show was still on season 11. oh my god it's terrible but it's it's uh
hilarious at the same time even though it was so scary when it happened
because the production value the cost of the show is probably like 150 an episode
it's so bad and the actors they hire
are so bad we should do like a scary surgical room with like bloody
nurses and doctors like the one we did together back in high school yes but much better much scarier
is that show do they do like recreations or is it meant to be real it's recreation okay it's mostly bad
recreations can be funny yeah it's mostly like they interview the real people and they're like you know being
interviewed and then they have a narrator and with the spooky voice and uh then the whole show is basically like
a narrative recreation whether it's actors we're playing the people telling this real
ghost story it's hilarious if you want to watch a show that's on a major network discovery
channel under the discovery channel banner that is that has the lowest production value
for example there's a scene where
most recent episode i know you're going to cut all this out if i have if i can find clips of it i won't cut it
it's going to cut all this out uh where they're they're in this cabin and the cabin's super old right and the girls
like i i i wanted to remodel this haunted cabin because the ghost kept bothering us
nicole ends up sharing her bed with an unwelcome guest
so i started tearing up the carpet and it was this nasty carpet that probably has been there since the 1940s
and then they show the shot and they went out to home depot and they
bought a brand new roll of carpet it looked like indoor outdoor carpeting from probably the 1940s or 50s
and they laid it on the floor and they unrolled it and then she rolled it back up
and she's like slowly rolling it to pretend like she's removing the carpet made no effort to make it look real yes
yeah and it's like old carpet would you rip it out and there's like dust and there's the foam underneath it and
it's just it was just laying on hardwood right and then they they peel it back it's
just like pretending to roll it i think they added some sound effects of like ripping and i'm like that's brand new
[ __ ] carpet that they just bought at the big box uh home store awesome i'm
like that you're not there's nothing old looking about this car but it was hilarious and then of course the the
thing was that they revealed a blood stain right and the blood is still red and wet
and she's like oh it stinks but it's supposed to be blood that's been there for decades
50 years yeah like a blood stain from 50 years under carpet would just look like a faint brown
stain like blood turns like a brown color and it would not look red and it would
not definitely still be wet so it's like like whoever's maybe a ghost kept it
preserved whoever's making this show they're just like whatever like we have to show someone ripping up carpet in this in
this in this haunted cabin from 1940s carpet they're like well
uh what's the cheapest way we could possibly do this yeah there's stuff like that and then there's some just some really lousy acting i was
laughing hysterically at a recent episode what the hell is that
i don't know it's blood adrian i i gotta say you're selling me on it i
love bad recreations oh you'll like watch just watch the most recent season of uh did it used to have higher
production value it used to be kind of a spooky show in the first couple of seasons okay and then everybody gave up
the the production value was okay they kept using the same set but um
it was a little like more spooky i kind of more so believe this now no no no this is trash
well now that they're not trying i'm way more interested they are trying as little as possible to to get a show
out that sounds great with the worst actors you'll ever see on a
actually produced show on television okay
why are you so scared it's just me i know i this house
unfathomably bad can they pronounce words is the real
question they got to hire me on one of the shows i'll say uh this ghost is unfathomably bad
i'm franken and out of my quits out of my whisk out of my whisk
frightened out of the whisk well that's our section on tv shows recent tv crap
slim pickings but severance is great uh and then we're gonna come back and
we're gonna talk about movies either after this commercial break or in
another video we released in a week and a half stay tuned to find out if the video ends here i guess you'll
know and if it doesn't end here then we'll talk about movies yeah but the important part is to like our pinned
comment saying we will watch the batman
if it gets to a hundred thousand likes we will watch the batman and do a proper review oh i didn't agree to this part of
it what are you talking about i just wanna say you watched it we're just we'll just watch it we don't have to make a video about it oh okay well how
will they know that you've watched it though without a proper discussion of it well i'll just say we watched it
are you trustworthy i don't know what do you people think
watching the batman not guaranteed
