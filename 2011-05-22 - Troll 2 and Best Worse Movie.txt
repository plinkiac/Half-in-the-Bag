PLINKETT:
Half in the bag.
Fuck movies.

SPADOWSKI:
First thing that stands out, it's sort of a nice costume.
You have, you see, you see a movie like, like Spiderman, or Batman, the studio's paid a lot of attention to those costumes.

OFFICER:
Wow.
Yeah, you were right.

JAY:
Yeah, he was just terrible.

OFFICER:
Normally, this department frowns upon murder, but in this case I think I'm gonna make an exception and not report this.

JAY:
Wow, uh, thank you, officer.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean, we thought we were screwed when The Watchman sold us out.
Fucking stupid crime fighter.

SPADOWSKI:
Oh, fuck!

OFFICER:
Murdering an untalented, pathetic loser who wants to be yet another internet film critic is hardly a crime.
At least it shouldn't be.
In fact, we're glad to have citizens out there like yourselves who are willing to do their part.

MIKE:
Yes!
More murders!

OFFICER:
Well, shall we head back to the station, Cooper?

OFFICER COOPER:
Actually, sir, I'd like to stay and ask these boys some additional questions.

MIKE:
Is there something else we can help you with, officer?
You boys live here?

OFFICER COOPER:
Uh, actually no.
This is Mr. Plinkett's house.

JAY:
Yeah, we're, uh, VCR repairman.

OFFICER COOPER:
Are you aware that having more than twelve beer bottles in a non-recyclable container is a violation of city ordinance?

MIKE:
You bet.

JAY:
We love beer!

MIKE:
Are you wearing that, that new Britney Spears perfume?

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
Fantasy.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

MIKE:
How the fuck do you know what it's called?

OFFICER COOPER:
No.
Nope.
Uh, Macy's had a big, uh, bust earlier.
Man.
Perp
Tried to steal panties, and really crappy perfume.
You do what you gotta do.
Tackled the guy.
Got perfume all over me.
It's part of the job.
I love the job.
Go police!

OFFICER COOPER:
You don't talk like any cop I've ever met before.

OFFICER COOPER:
What?

MIKE:
Yeah.
You sound more like an undercover hooker to me.
You know, if you are, and we ask you, you have to tell us because that's the law.

OFFICER COOPER:
Shit, no!
I ain't no hooker!
Boo to hookers!
I'm a cop, through and through!
What do you, what are you guys doing, watching the game?
Hanging out?

JAY:
We're actually on a four-hour break.
Um, we were gonna watch Troll 2.

OFFICER COOPER:
Holy shit!
I love that movie.
I'm gonna go to get beer.
You guys want anything?

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
Sure.
Yeah.

MIKE:
She ain't no cop.

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
No.
Troll 2, man.
That's great.
I love it.

OFFICER COOPER:
Hey, you guys are almost out of beer.
I had an ice cream party in your kitchen.
I hope you don't mind.

JAY:
I didn't even know Plinkett had any ice cream.

OFFICER COOPER:
Oh, he doesn't.
I shit in my hand and smeared it all over the floor.

ARNOLD:
Oh, my god!

JAY:
Have you seen Troll 2 before?

OFFICER COOPER:
Um, yes, I have.
Troll 1 is a movie that came out...
I have no idea...

JAY:
Mid-80's.

OFFICER COOPER:
Mid-80's.

JAY:
Sonny Bono gets turned into a plant.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
I believe I was at the video store.
And I saw that there was a Troll 2, and asked if I could get it.
And I watched it.
And I remember vividly thinking the first 15 minutes, they put the wrong movie in here.

MICHAEL WAITS:
When I was a kid, I had an imaginary playmate, too.

DIANA WAITS:
But it wasn't your dead grandfather.

OFFICER COOPER:
The first time I watched it, I waited through the entire movie for it to come back around to the troll.

JAY:
Yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
And it never did.
And I was so confused.

JAY:
There's no trolls in Troll 2.

OFFICER COOPER:
There's no anything in Troll 2.
It, it doesn't make any sense.

JAY:
No.

OFFICER COOPER:
They turn people into trees and eat them.

ARNOLD:
Grab the pot and drag me out, quick!

FRIEND:
I'll try.

ARNOLD:
Come on, hurry!

JAY:
I, I saw it when it first came out on video, too.
Uh, oddly enough.
It wasn't advertised, it was just there one day on the release wall.
I was like,
"Troll 2?"
"Fuck yeah!"
And you put it in, and, uh...
The only thing I remembered years later about it was, uh, the "I'm tightening my belt so I don't feel hunger pains".

MICHAEL WAITS:
And you can't piss on hospitality!
I won't allow it!

JOSHUA WAITS:
What are you going to do to me, daddy?

MICHAEL WAITS:
TIghtening my belt by one loop so I don't feel hunger pains.
And your sister and mother will have to do likewise.

JAY:
When I watched the movie a little kid, I didn't really understand how bad it was.
But I remembered that part, where it was like,
"What?"
"What is that?"
"Like, people don't say things like this."
And then it, when it was released on DVD, I was like,
"That's the hunger pains movie!"
"I remember that!"

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
And so I watched it again, and it was like, uh, discovering a masterpiece.

OFFICER COOPER:
It is.

JAY:
Where I was like...

OFFICER COOPER:
Completely.

JAY:
"How did I forget about everything else in this movie?"
"That's so amazing."

ARNOLD:
And remember!
Aughhh!
Aughhh!

MIKE:
I have a bit of a different perspective on Troll 2.
I did not see it until recently.
We watched it together with my friend, Rich Evans.

DIANA WAITS:
Who are the goblins?

MICHAEL WAITS:
The goblins?

MIKE:
But it was my first time seeing the movie.
And it's amazing.
It's an amazing film.
The first time you watch it, and I noticed this, uh, you specifically watching it...
You, you're not laughing so much at how bad it is.
You're more just confused.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I was like this.
And then you realize that you're making that face.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

MIKE:
You, you, your brain makes that face because it doesn't know what to do with your face muscles.
Your brain is so transfixed on trying to figure out what's happening that you lose control.
I'm lucky I didn't shit in my pants.

ARNOLD:
No.
Please.
Ma'am.
I beg you.
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do to me with that?

MIKE:
There's bad movies that are technically bad, like, like, Samurai Cop, where the acting is bad and the stories is bad and all that.
But, like, Samurai Cop, like, just the editing...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And the, the shot...

JAY:
The shots.
Nothing, yeah.

MIKE:
Everything's, like confusing.
And Troll 2 is, like, competently made...

JAY:
Yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

MIKE:
For a movie of its time.
But the writing in it...
And the acting is bad.
But the writing is, is so bizarre.

ELLIOTT:
Oh!

HOLLY WAITS:
Release your "instincts" in the bathroom!

ELLIOTT:
Are you nuts?
Are you trying to turn me into a homo?

HOLLY WAITS:
It wouldn't be too hard.
If my father discovers you here, he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them.
He can't stand you.

MIKE:
There's lots, lots of subtle things in that movie that just don't make sense.

OFFICER COOPER:
The scene where he gets up and pisses on all the food.

JOSHUA WAITS:
I must do it!
I must do it!

MIKE:
Doesn't the grandpa stop time for him?

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yes.
That's another magical power the grandpa has...

OFFICER COOPER:
They're about to eat him.

JAY:
Has for some reason.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because then he can stop time.

OFFICER COOPER:
The grandpa can stop time

JAY:
But only for 60 seconds.

GRANDPA SETH:
You have 30 seconds to come up with some way to stop them.

MIKE:
They're eating food.
And it's, like, green.

JAY:
There's green on the corn.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Like, what is that supposed to be?

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
No one would eat that.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm.

MIKE:
No normal person would say,
"Okay."
"Well, it, it looks like toothpaste."
"And it's on the corn."
And you're like,
"What?"
"What's what's going on?"
And it's so fascinating.

JAY:
Why is the daughter starting her dance routine, doing this?

OFFICER COOPER:
I'm American!

MIKE:
Yeah, that's bizarre.

OFFICER COOPER:
One of my favorite crazy-ass things from this movie is where she's trying to seduce that kid.
And they eat a cob of corn together.
What the fuck.

JAY:
I thought that was was a pretty erotic scene, actually.

OFFICER COOPER:
It was very erotic.
They had no idea what the fuck they were doing, and just threw a bunch of shit that seemed, you know, stereotypically American into a movie.
And it has zero continuity.
Nothing makes sense.
And you feel like something's wrong with you because you haven't been able to keep up.
But, it's not that way at all.
It really doesn't make sense.

JAY:
The movie makes you question your sanity.

OFFICER COOPER:
Completely.

JAY:
And your comprehension skills.

COOPER
I really think the cover of the film, the VHS, completely, is a microcosm of this movie.
They're not trolls.
They're goblins.
They don't look like this.
Or this.

JAY:
What is that?

OFFICER COOPER:
This isn't even a goblin.
It's, it's a Troll doll.

MIKE:
Looks like a Troll doll.

OFFICER COOPER:
That you can win at the roller rink that has glowing eyes.
There's a confused kid coming down the stairs in his pajamas, who also isn't anywhere in the film.

JAY:
No.

OFFICER COOPER:
And then an eight-foot-tall werewolf with a pickaxe.
It's, uh, brilliantly shitty.
And I will adore that film the rest of my life.

JAY:
It's, it's the bad movie that everyone can enjoy.

OFFICER COOPER:
It is.
Troll 2.

MIKE:
Hell, yeah.
It's "Nilbog" spelled forwards.

MIKE:
Well, not Troll 2, but "goblins".

JAY:
Oh...

MIKE:
You missed the point.

JAY:
God, you're an idiot.

MIKE:
By the way, um, officer, was it...?

OFFICER COOPER:
Cooper.

MIKE:
Cooper, yes.
Um, I just happen to notice you, you wear a lot of makeup for a cop.

OFFICER COOPER:
I do?

JAY:
Yeah.
Isn't there some sort of regulation about not looking like a whore when you're on duty?

OFFICER COOPER:
Hmm.
What's next?

JAY:
What do you mean,
"What's next?"

OFFICER COOPER:
Well, you said you had, like, four hours to kill.
So could we watch another movie?

JAY:
Well, we can watch, uh, Best Worst Movie.
It's the documentary about Troll 2.

OFFICER COOPER:
Holy shit!
Let's watch that.
First, I gotta take a major piss.
Can I use your bathroom, or do you want me to just go in the bushes?

JAY:
Wow, that was the most heartwarming movie about irony I've ever seen.

MIKE:
It's, it was a beautiful film.

OFFICER COOPER:
It really was.
There's a few times that I balled uncontrollably.

GEORGE HARDY:
I was in a movie back in 1990.
It's called Troll 2.
And it's become known as a worst film of all time.

PATIENT:
Really?

MIKE:
So we just watched Best Worst Movie, which is a documentary film made about Troll 2.

MICHAEL PAUL STEPHENSON:
18 years ago, I got the lead role in my first movie.

JAY:
The movie was directed by Michael Paul Stevenson, who is not the kid on the case for Troll 2.

FAN #1:
There's this movie you've got to see.
I've watched it a million times.

HOST:
Thank you all for coming to the 5th Annual Los Angeles Troll 2 Party.

FAN #2:
Oh, my god.
You didn't see it?

FAN #3:
You haven't seen Troll 2?
We're watching it now.

FAN #4:
That's what people do withthis movie.
They pass this DVD around like it's the Bible.

JAY:
Officer Cooper, what did you think of a Best Worst Movie?

OFFICER COOPER:
I really adored it.
I thought it was fantastic.
There is, you know, sort of that, I don't know, sentimentality to this movie.
I saw it a long time ago, so that's probably part of it.
But it's just so bad.
and you feel so bad for the movie.
That's why I love the documentary, because they really captured that.
It wasn't just,
"Oh, here's a stupid movie that people..."
"And we have no idea why they like it."

OFFICER COOPER:
"Look at these crazy people..."

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

JAY:
"That like this weird movie."

OFFICER COOPER:
Right?
They really capture that.

JAY:
It's more affectionate than that.

OFFICER COOPER:
And also, the people in it are completely insane.

JAY:
Yes.

OFFICER COOPER:
That's, I mean...

JAY:
Multiple people that worked on the movie...

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
Are nuts.

OFFICER COOPER:
I can't imagine how happy he was to go find these people and find out that they had lost their mind.
I mean, from a director standpoint, that has to really be...

JAY:
I, I don't know.
The movie seems to try to be affectionate towards all these people.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
It's not like,
"Well, look at the crazy people!"
But they are crazy, and the movie doesn't try to hide that either.

WOMAN:
So they make noise all night long.
And the noise is so intense it sometimes makes you dizzy.

GEORGE HARDY:
What does it sound like?
What noise does it...

WOMAN:
[unintelligible]

MICHAEL PAUL STEPHENSON:
That is...

GEORGE HARDY:
Wow.
Yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
And they didn't make fun of her.
They weren't mean.
They just said,
"Here's a crazy person."

MIKE:
A little bit.
A little bit.

JAY:
It, it really rides that line.

OFFICER COOPER:
Ehh, you know...

JAY:
That's, that's, yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
They kicked the line a little.

MIKE:
It's edited in a way to where they reveal her, like...
Becasue they they don't show her for the longest time...

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

MIKE:
And when they do, it's intentional, like,
"Ooh!"
Then they just leave these, like, long, lingering pauses.
And she compares Troll 2 to Casablanca.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's, like,
"It's the same, same type."
"It's in the same league."

OFFICER COOPER:
"It's the same league as Casablanca."

MIKE:
And then they just linger on her, on her crazy eyes.

JAY:
Well, they're both movies about people.

MIKE:
So, the two people that like the film are the two people that are the most insane.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Her, and the shopkeeper.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Speaking of the shopkeeper, the moment when he's, he's...
It's like, it's kind of sad where he comes out on stage, and they're all, like, cheering.

DON PACKARD:
I went like this.
I went like this.
And everybody applauded.
I was thrilled!
I never was thrilled at being who I was until that moment in Manhattan.

MIKE:
They're, they're kind of making fun of him.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.
"Hey, you're that idiot in that movie!"

MIKE:
But, but to him, he said it was like, like the greatest moment of his life.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.
So who cares if he doesn't know?

MIKE:
So, so, yeah, it, it's those little moments, like, between people that, that are like,
"Okay, well..."
And then you feel bad because everyone's cheering wildly for him.
And they're not really cheering for him.

OFFICER COOPER:
But he, what if he really doesn't know.

MIKE:
But, but it's like, but it, he felt good about it, so...

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

MIKE:
All these things come out of a movie.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
The people and their lives is what's most interesting about Best Worst Movie.

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I mean, I really like this documentary.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Very good.
Very entertaining because, when you were describing it, I thought it was gonna be about Troll 2.
And, and about, like, how they made the movie...

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And how it was, like, a disaster, and all this stuff.

JAY:
Well, that's a part of it, but...

MIKE:
It's a very small part.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah, yeah:

MIKE:
It's, it's more about, like, all the people that made it,,,
And, and it's, it gets kind of, like, psychological...

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
In a way about how everyone responds to this thing.
Both, like, negative and positive.
And how, you know, some people are just kind of confused by it.
And some people like George Hardy, uh, the actor...

GEORGE HARDY:
Hi!
Nice to meet you!
I don't feel that kind of feeling when I'm doing a cavity.

MIKE:
He relishes the limelight.
The, the attention.
He loves it.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He loves to be in the spotlight.
And so it's, it's kind of interesting on his personality.
And then you have the director, Claudio.

CLAUDIO:
You think it to you the worse movie.
I did a very good movie.

MAN:
He reall believed in what he was making.

CLAUDIO:
Action!

MIKE:
He's a director.
He's like a egomaniac.

OFFICER COOPER:
Completely.

MIKE:
And, um, he loves the attention.
But at the same time, it's like a double-edged sword.
At the same time, he hates that people are laughing at his movie.
So he's, like, he's very conflicted.

OFFICER COOPER:
He barely remembers making this film.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

OFFICER COOPER:
I mean, he doesn't really know what the hell it was about.
But he's furious that these people aren't taking it seriously.

JAY:
Yeah.

OFFICER COOPER:
I really like that the director, too, stayed away from trying to make it all seem like it was easy and good.

JAY:
Well, the, the, yeah.
It shows that there's, you know...

OFFICER COOPER:
Ebb and pull of it.

JAY:
A cult following has its place.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.
Exactly.

JAY:
You try to expose that to people that have no sort of appreciation or understanding of bad movies.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

JAY:
Like, when he's going around, when George Hardy is going around his hometown...

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And trying to promote the screen of Troll 2 to all these locals, that...

OFFICER COOPER:
It's this really bad movie.
Literally, you're gonna want to kill yourself when you watch it.

GEORGE HARDY:
You see that poster right there?

WOMAN:
Mm-hmm.

GEORGE HARDY:
Troll 2?

WOMAN:
Mm-hmm.

GEORGE HARDY:
You know anything about it?

WOMAN:
Mm-mmm.

GEORGE HARDY:
You don't?
Are you serious?
Oh, my goodnes..

WOMAN:
It's a movie or something?

GEORGE HARDY:
Yeah.
It's a movie.
Okay.

MIKE:
The documentary explores that idea of why something that's bad is, you know, so cherished.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You know, like, it's, and it's, it doesn't try to, like, find out why.
It just sort of, like, explores that idea.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

MIKE:
And there's there's, these scenes where, like, the director comes to the first time to LA for a screening, and they're all like, we love you, man!

FAN #5:
Troll 2, yeah!

CLAUDIO:
Did you see me in the movie?

FAN #5:
Yeah!
It's awesome!

CLAUDIO:
What do you think about?

FAN #5:
It's amazing.

CLAUDIO:
It's amazing?

MIKE:
But, it's like, at the same time they don't seem to fully understand...
They don't really like that, you know.

JAY:
Yeah.
It's, it, they're, the audience is cheering and, like,
"Yeah, I got your autograph!"
In, in almost an ironic way.

JAY:
It's, it's, yeah.
It's all irony.

MIKE:
And there's all these different levels of, of like what, how people respond to, to this movie.
And, and how people, like, interpret it, or their own perception of it.
It's, it's very weird.

NEWS REPORTER:
Two decades after it was made, Troll 2 is finding finally an audience.

FAN #6:
It is sold out for tonight!

FAN #7:
My friends and I thought we were the only people in the world who knew about this.

MIKE:
Watching someone else fail miserably is, it's, it's almost evil.
Like, that people enjoy that.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.

MIKE:
It's sickening.
But at the same time, it's wonderful.

OFFICER COOPER:
It is.
It's sick and wonderful.

MIKE:
That, that's, that's like a psychology behind it.

JAY;
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, this movie also contains one of the greatest moments of a person's sort of self-realization ever caught on camera, which is when George Hardy is at the horror convention.

MIKE:
Oh, right.

GEORGE HARDY:
Oh, my god.
This is fricking...
Folks are weird.
I mean, this is not Halloween.
This, what's today?
March the 9th?

MAN:
It's March, yeah.

GEORGE HARDY:
This is fricking weird.
These folks are just...
They've lost it.

JAY:
And he's talking about the washed-up horror actors that are there, signing autographs for a movie they did 20 years ago.
And he's like,
"Don't they have anything better to do?"
And he's like,
"Then I thought, 'Don't I have anything better to do?'"
It's like,
"Oh."
"He kind of gets it."

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
Finally.

MIKE:
Yeah, he kind of goes through a journey...

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Of, of discovery.

OFFICER COOPER:
On camera.

MIKE:
He, he, he doesn't know, you know...
He realizes what Troll 2 is, and that it's, you know...
And then he tries to, like, capitalize off it...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
For his own ego.
And then he kind of realizes,
"Okay."
"Well, I've seen it 20 times by now."
"I'm sick of this shit."

JAY:
Well, that's the amazing thing about this movie is that, throughout it, you get to know a lot about George Hardy, and you get to learn his aspirations.
When he was young, he always wanted to be sort of, like, a famous actor, or someone that entertained people.
He didn't achieve that, because he is a terrible actor.

WOMAN:
It was so bad.
And he was so, um...
His accent and his acting.
It was just so...
Just, the strangest thing to watch.

JAY:
But the movie makes you root for him, be like,
"Man, I wish this guy was a superstar."

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Een though he's terrible.

OFFICER COOPER:
But the thing is, he wants to be an actor because, you know, he says,
"I want to reach people and I want to do things."
And it's, I don't know if he realizes it or not, but he does affect a ton of people.
There's this whole town that adores him, and goes out in like, saying, you know, there are good people.
There's people like George Hardy.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah, well, they touch on that, like, they...
Everyone but him kind of talks about how great he is.

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And, and, and he's kind of like,
"Well, I like my dental practice."
"You know, it brings me a good income."
"And I have a comfortable living."
"But I've always wanted to be in front of the camera."
All the people in the town, the dental patients of, you know, the townspeople, they all love him, genuinely.

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
The other group of people all love him...

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah, that's interesting.

MIKE:
Not genuinely.

OFFICER COOPER:
Yeah.

JAY:
Ironically.

MIKE:
And, and he, he...

OFFICER COOPER:
And yet he gravitates towards that, to the people who like him because of that.

GEORGE HARDY:
When I go to these screenings, I would never have dreamed.
Does anybody want my autograph?
Tell you what.
We'll go over your treatment plans in just a second.

OFFICER COOPER:
It was endearing.
Completely endearing.
They really embraced the people.
Didn't make fun of them.
Which is, you know, if you're going to do sort of a study, a documentary about people, that is what is entertaining about it, is their humanity.
And the way that they live and see things and love things or hate things.
And he just embraced every single person.
Not judging them.
Just, this is who they are, around a crap movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Well, that's, that's like the whole, the whole package with this movie.
It's, it's, it's not about Troll 2.

OFFICER COOPER:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
It is on the surface level.
But it's about movies and people's love of movies.

OFFICER COOPER:
Right.
And it's, it's just kind of fascinating how just, just a 90-minute movie about trolls can affect so many people in so many different ways.
Therein lies the brilliance of Best Worst Movie.

JAY:
Yes.

OFFICER COOPER:
Agreed.

MIKE:
Best Best documentary.

GEORGE HARDY:
I was in a film.
I was in a film called Troll 2.

OFFICER COOPER:
Well, boys, it's been fun watching movies with you, but I'm afraid I need to get back to work.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

OFFICER COOPER:
But first, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to issue a citation for violating the city's open beer bottle law.

JAY:
Really?
Even after all the fun we've had talking about Troll 2?

OFFICER COOPER:
The law's the law, boys.

JAY:
All right.

OFFICER COOPER:
What's gonna happen is that I will write you the citation.
You will need to go down to City Hall to pay it.
The fee will be $20.

MIKE:
Okay.
Fine.
Whatever.

JAY:
Okay.

OFFICER COOPER:
I've written them the ticket, and they have agreed to pay it...

JAY:
What?

MIKE:
Wh-, wh-...
I knew it!
You're a hooker!
You're an undercover hooker!

OFFICER COOPER:
Sorry, boys.
I'm just doing my job...as a hooker!
Ha ha ha ha haaa!

JAY:
You bitch!
You lied!
You're worse than a goblin!

MIKE:
All we wanted to do is just watch Troll 2 and Best Worst Movie!

OFFICER COOPER:
Too bad!
Now it's time for you to pay us money to perform humiliating sex acts!

MIKE:
Fine.
Damn you, cop hooker!
You won't get away with this!

OFFICER COOPER:
Come on, girls!
You know what to do!
Fuck those losers!
Ah ha ha ha ha haaa!
