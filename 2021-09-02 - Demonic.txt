half in the bag
i think he's still
breathing it's hard to tell
either way the biohazard suits that we
ordered should get here in a couple days
then we could finally go back and get
some plinkett blood
money money money
because we're going to sell the
antibodies to joe biden is that what's
happening yeah oh because blinket has
the omega variant
the most dangerous coronavirus variant
of them all oh and if he survives then
his blood will create precious precious
antibodies to fight off this new
dangerous variant of which mr plinkett
is the only person to have it but in the
future it's going to spread around and
if we have those antibodies
money in the bank oh so we're following
through on this whole story line huh
look mike i know we're wearing these
masks so we don't catch crazy hey keep
your mask on you idiot
i was the one who was in close contact
with mr plinkett not you
remember come here you prick oh you get
in the wheelchair i'm not cutting no fucking wheelchair oh
so shouldn't you be the one wearing the
mask no it's to protect you from me in
case i caught the omega variant
idiot but mike people wear masks to help
prevent the spread of coronavirus no you
wear the master you don't get it
plus there's currently a mask mandate in
our state county or local well if
there's a masked mandate then shouldn't
you be wearing a mask it's a voluntary
mandate
that's right a voluntary mandate
oh
would you look at this a judge in our
state county or local just put a stay on
a lawsuit that was pending challenging
the mask mandate
what
oh wait no sorry i read it wrong what
there was a stay on a temporary order to
lift a ban on the voluntary mask mandate
what
oh
wait
they just updated the news oh
the stay on the ban of the voluntary
mask mandate has been challenged what by
lifting an order to overturn a ruling
that a ban on a voluntary mass mandate
is unconstitutional
wait
now a judge has overturned a block on a
stay of the challenge of the ban of the
voluntary mass mandate what well that's
good bad news
what the [ __ ] does that mean
it means you have to wear a mask but i
don't this is [ __ ] this makes about
as much sense as people still giving
money to neil blomkamp to make movies
your mother angela issues are patient
what i've been out of touch with her for
a very long time
what hey do you remember that game the
sims
what if your mom was possessed by a
demon that looked like a giant bird and
the only way you could contact her
was through virtual reality game of the
sims
that's what this movie's about it's
called demonic
so we're talking about demonic uh the
new film by neil blom camp
uh who made famously made uh district
nine
a really good movie yeah followed by
uh elysium
and or chappie i forget which order
elysium then chappie then an extended
break
and now demonic he's back baby right i
did not see elysium i did it wasn't
great
and then chappie was worse i felt like i
got what i needed to get from the
trailer of elysium yeah it's like the
like a sci-fi thing about like the haves
and have-nots and then i'm like okay i
get the the social commentary that's
that's one of his traits up until this
movie is the heavy-handed social
commentary even district nine but that's
there's so much weird [ __ ] in that movie
that
it doesn't like overshadow it
um
but then chappie was just like a
confusing mess of like what are you
trying to say something about ais
something about police
something about
gangs i don't know something about short
circuit something about short circuit
beats robocop
and then you get to this movie
which is
lots of weird ideas that's what neil
blom camp is it doesn't always come
together in a cohesive movie but he
always has these weird ideas
or had
then you get to this movie and that's
the first thing is i never ever ever
ever want to see another demon
possession movie for the rest of my
[ __ ] life well this is not
really
a demon possession movie uh i mean it is
but it's like a like a really
weird take on it um which you know
i guess is admirable an attempt right
it's admirable in the attempt because
it's not like
we got to go to this house and this lady
is possessed and they got her strapped
to the bed like a traditional catholic
priest comes and you know yeah
um do you remember we watched a movie
uh something there was like if there was
like a cop in it
was it like eric banner or something oh
yeah there's the uh scott derrickson
movie uh
the devil's something devil is the movie
he did right before he did uh doctor
strange yeah the devil the the the devil
something something you're the devil's
son i got nothing against the old blom
cam
i did not like this movie at all but the
one thing i'll say is
uh it's getting terrible reviews
it's like something like 15
on tomato
but i kind of admired because he's kind
of like an m night shyamalan where he
comes out of the gate with a movie that
is
well received does really well and then
everything else is like
a high concept idea that doesn't quite
work and no one likes it there's like
movie after movie and then like i don't
know i i don't even know if he can get a
big budget movie made anymore so the
idea that he's just like [ __ ] it i'm
just gonna make i think this movie is
like less than two million dollars to
make i'm just gonna make this low budget
thing and there's something kind of
admirable about that like [ __ ] it i'm
just gonna make something
yeah i i
caught a couple
uh little bits he uh he guess he did the
circuit the press quote-unquote press
junket circuit which is all done
which is now done on zoom
uh with
with pathetic youtube channels
hi neil how are you doing today
good how are you doing
good oh man
um it is an honor to talk to you sir
oh thank you yeah i apologize for the
weird background i had to pull over on a
road trip home to talk to you
uh and and and you know he's there and
he's got his chair and in the background
is part of the demonic poster it was
like the graphic was too big you can't
sell what it's supposed to be yeah every
every interview i clicked on it had that
yeah the same the same thing and so he's
like jumping around i think he must have
done him all in an afternoon
and and he was being interviewed and i
didn't want to watch them all i saw lots
of them
and i'll probably show clips here i'm
assuming it's just like a normal press
junket where you get asked the same
questions and give your same stock
answers i clicked on a couple and i
started them up and it's like first of
all loved the movie and now i'm like oh
god no i'm having nerd crew flashbacks
neil amazing job on this film me and my
girlfriend watch it and we're
terrified uh to say the least uh but i i
remember i just saw uh one thing he said
and uh
he shot this during kovid it basically
the summary is because of covid i wanted
to do something that we could just put
together ourselves and make because
everything else seemed to be paused um
so he was like i wanted to make a movie
but there was a lot of restrictions
obviously from kovid so i i could only
do this this and this and then i was
like okay i can't watch anymore because
that's gonna be stuck in the back of my
head the whole time i watched this sure
and so yeah obviously a limited budget
limited
actors
effects uh very lots of handicaps and
put in place when making this movie um
but
why this subject matter
and why this script well that's where it
felt to me like
well i want to make a movie and like i
said that's admirable but at the same
time i never got a sense from watching
the movie that
neil blomkamp has any affection for
horror i mean cosmichara
is definitely something that
in
i don't know where it is in my previous
work but
i'm very interested in it and and
bodhihara is another thing that i'm
definitely interested in it doesn't feel
it's not a good horror movie it's never
scary at any moment and it rarely feels
like it's even trying to be it's just
like horror is uh we're
we can at least make our money back
because horror always makes money it
kind of has that like cynical feel it's
like
the the filmmaking equivalent to that
scene in whitehouse american summer when
janine garofalo tells paul rudd to pick
his plates up and he's just like
like that's how this movie felt like uh
demon possession
uh her friend comes over at three in the
morning and turns into a demon and does
contortionist [ __ ]
i'm not gonna make it scary but i know
we gotta shoot it so many things in life
can be compared to that scene from
american
the last year and a half of most
people's lives i guess can be yeah
that might be the best scene in
cinematic history i think it is it's
just like
that's just
so you all you have to do is say it's
like uh
it's like darmok you know paul rudd in
cafeteria
right
oh i understand you
i understand what you're saying but that
but that's how it felt to me like like
oh we'll make a horror movie because we
can make our money back
i never got a sense that there was any
sort of affection for not just horror
but this story
like it seems like because you know bomb
camp he likes weird sci-fi ideas and
there's a little bit of that in this
and then there's
i don't know if we'll get into spoilers
i don't know if it matters no one's seen
this movie
um but there's one reveal
about two-thirds of the way through that
was so [ __ ] weird and i was like oh
if this goes in a crazy direction i'll
be on board
which is uh so not roomie not new me
repace is what i call the lead actress
because she looks like
the new mirror pace from prometheus but
it's not her
uh she goes to this
medical research facility that's where
her mom is being kept they got her on a
little
diving cap thing and she's plugged into
the local community college sure yeah
wherever they could shoot where there
were a lot of people around
but it's revealed at a certain point
that that organization is actually a
front for the catholic church and these
are
rogue
militarized
catholic exorcist priests with giant
guns
and i got so excited for five seconds
but then the next time you see them
they've all just been killed off screen
the only interesting aspect of the movie
and it's so underdeveloped
that i i'm assuming that's a budget
related thing budget and or covid
because yeah you have a big action
sequence with guns going off and
things flying around and explosions and
stunts and people being pulled back on
wires and that's when you need crew to
come in in in
a little army of crew members to come in
and work the rigs and blow things up and
pyrotechnics and
all that
you
just put put some fake blood on a guy
and tell him to lay down on the ground
you need one guy and some fake blood
yeah right jay but that's one of those
concepts where if you're going to
introduce that and not follow through on
it then don't even
bother what a what a disappointment neil
i love demonic and and let me tell you
the only interesting aspect of the film
by interesting you mean
bad yes entertainingly bad though i was
like this is [ __ ] crazy
it's so ridiculous number one right out
of the gate location
neil blom camp is originally from south
africa
and johannesburg south africa i think
and he's also canadian
and so this was shot in vancouver so i'm
watching it right
and i'm like where is this right
all these are these mountains
this is like south africa is this filmed
in south africa it looks beautiful right
and then i see like a police car the
whole time i'm trying to figure out
where it's from i was like trying to
look at license plates i was like where
is this they don't they don't have the
the european-ish those longer license
plates they have the north american
license plates so i'm like where is that
you could have changed them out of
course to make it look like maybe it's
supposed to be california i don't know
and i'm like where is this so i'm
distracted by that
and then i see something on the cop car
and it's some name that starts with an o
i saw that i was like what is that yes i
kept getting distracted by i mean this
is these are things that a normal person
probably won't even be paying attention
to but and then i googled it and it's
it's a region near um vancouver
that's known for its like
wine and so come enjoy a six night wine
tour of this beautiful region in
vancouver and they're they're drinking
wine in the film oh yeah and then i'm
like
a
beautiful
paradise
was known for its delectable wines is
the greatest place to set a horror
picture
and i'm like
then it's then it's that's where the
kovid comes in i'm like he's stuck there
he's stuck in beautiful vancouver in the
summer of 2020
trying to film a movie about
a spooky exorcism
i mean that [ __ ] needs to be done
in october
in
massachusetts
where the leaves are falling
and we hear tubular bells yes okay
i don't need to see people sipping wine
with beautiful
sunsets i was also really distracted and
this is again related to the budget but
the first time she meets up with her i
guess it's her old boyfriend yeah and
they're sitting outside at some
bar or restaurant or whatever and it was
so [ __ ] windy the day they shot it
every shot her hair is blowing like
crazy
and uh that's one of those things where
it's like well that's what they got that
day so that's what they had to work with
how are you doing
how are you how are you holding up stuff
yeah right there's live mics it was an
80 yard it's very windy yeah and i
wanted to mention the patio scene
because yeah her
her is her boyfriend her boyfriend's
name's martin her name's carly and her
friend's name sam yes i know this
because i looked up on imdb and that's
all they're like real names yeah i know
carly pope is the lead actor yeah it's
not new me rapace everybody it's not
although noomi rapace
was in an alien she's in prometheus yeah
and neil blomkamp was supposed to make
alien five bringing back to courtney
weaver
mike bean and then
ridley scott said no
actually what happened is after that
then he started making like short films
the under under something about oats oh
it's like a company something in his
company he's making quaker oats
commercials yeah he's making short films
for the internet under some banner
called oats yeah and that's again that
idea of like [ __ ] it like i did these
big movies they didn't go over well i'm
just gonna keep making stuff on my own
admirable he wants to create things yeah
he's trying we're just judging the final
results which isn't good
did he write he wrote wrote chappie
wrote elysium he wrote this yeah okay
see i think like when when you have
limitations
and his limitations are he wants to tell
spooky demonic story
and he's got this main character and a
relationship with her mother
and
there there are no
singular strong elements in the whole
film no if the characters and all their
relationships are really strong and well
done and well written
that could hold this up his his crutch
is he needs to rely on
space machine guns and monsters and big
budget effects in order to to carry the
movie to the finish line yeah the i mean
the the i guess the the heart of the
story it's like us as filmmakers but
with everything
you know
but yeah uh the relationship between
carly and her mom is kind of supposed to
be the heart of the movie but
we don't get any scenes with the mom
outside of the virtual reality we don't
we get a couple mentions of their
relationship it's not very strong
there's maybe you think of that movie
relic that we talked about from last
year
with the the girl that goes to take care
of her mom those alzheimer's or it's
like yeah well that's like again super
low budget lots of limitations but that
relationship is so strong that it that
it completely carries the whole movie
yeah [ __ ] creepy ass visuals and yeah
like really good visuals and
this movie doesn't have that no creepy
visuals no strong character stuff it's
like they got a dp that shot lifetime
network movies you know what i mean it
had that look to it yeah all the daytime
stuff is just very flat
i noticed some of the nighttime stuff
it's very grainy not like it wasn't shot
in film so it has that like digital
video grain
where they were shooting in low light
which again goes to the limitations
so that's that would be fine if it
wasn't distracting but i was distracted
by the low light as opposed to ooh this
is dark and creepy
but also with the limitations all the
virtual reality stuff i had a feeling
while watching the movie and i was they
confirmed it after the fact that this
was probably
like real
because it's not slick enough to be like
ooh virtual reality like we're
showcasing these special effects but
where they're actually like filming
you know when you see like a motion
capture and you see like the low res
version of it live while you're while
you're filming it it was that
um
so i it's like uh we have this
technology we'll film it this way and
that's why it has that kind of low res
glitchy quality to it yeah because
that's how it was actually recorded it's
like that's fair enough
better than making it look like i don't
know i was thinking of like the
lawnmower man or something or it's just
like
overdone bad cg effects
i know the lawnmower man's a dated
reference but
that was really bad yeah i also got
vibes from a different film that we
watched uh i can't remember the name of
it now i didn't quite enjoy it as much
as you but in hindsight it's a work of
art compared to this uh
where the lady
puts on a helmet and goes inside other
people's bodies to commit murders oh uh
possessor possessor yeah
that's how you do it
and
internally that's a movie where maybe
not the strongest story but the visuals
and the way the story is told is what
carries it and the acting and the acting
yeah the acting on this not great uh
let's just talk about
what happens
you got a lady
who lives in a city
whose profession is unknown we don't
know anything about her we don't know
anything about
her
friend sam moves back
from somewhere so what else is going on
i mean catch me up what have i missed
into a nice cabiny house
and they have some wine
and her friend sam was the one and i
think martin too the three main
characters were the three ones when they
were teenagers went to the sanatorium
to find her mother
so our lead character carly
her mother
worked for a hospital as some kind of
administrator or
somebody important who said
hey
there's an old abandoned sanatorium
and if you don't know what a sanatorium
is they're
they're in lots of ghost hunting
programs because they're all notoriously
haunted every single one of them is
haunted sanatorium is where you send
people who have tb tuberculosis
a highly contagious disease where you
cough yourself to death you can't cure
it so they put them on this building
most times the buildings are shaped
with a curve
and they put them and they build them
remotely obviously away from other
people and uh and they build them to
where the wind pattern
goes that way
so that the the people in the sanatorium
get a constant
uh a flow of fresh air
so that they could cough their
lungs out and it goes one way and comes
out the other side of the building i
didn't know any of this yeah and so
they're notoriously haunted because
bodies pile up sure people die all the
time and they send them some of them
have body shoots oh god where it's like
so many bodies it takes too long to
bring them from here to the morgue let's
make a shoot where we could shoot them
across the bottom of the building and so
the mom says i want to uh
renovate this sanatorium for some
[ __ ] reason
no one would ever do that
and so while the the girl and her friend
and the other friend are having some
bamboos the mom says i'm going to the
sanatorium by myself at night to check
it out
and she gets possessed by a demon
because we learned the sanatorium was
built on sacred sacred burial ground or
something evil land evil land that date
land that was sacred yes her friend
martin in our exposition dome yes who
was also some for some reason an expert
on demonicness well he wasn't an expert
but he looked things up on the internet
and so now he had a secret he had a
secret bunker oh that's right he had all
the [ __ ] on the yeah and he's been
drawing the picture of the evil chicken
for
years
right he's been doing lots of research
on it he's our exposition dump man that
scene was where i was like oh man we're
really in trouble starting to go
downhill it's so it just like one cliche
after another like the most worn out
cliches yeah built on the ancient land i
was like oh god it's it's a it's a
double a double whammy because
sanatoriums are just haunted in general
that's all that's enough like she got
possessed by a demon because the place
was haunted you see there was so much
death and disease there that opened the
portal to hell sure then they just say
well it's also also built on some kind
of evil land that dates back to the
1500s where there's just been death and
destruction there and the guy has
pictures on
reddit
that show that that's true
because he looked it up yeah
on the internet and he tells her all
about it and he's like i drew a picture
from my dreams
of the chicken demon and here it is
and it looks like a professional artist
drew it even though i'm some guy who
lays concrete
right
you're a really [ __ ] good artist
i drive a truck and i [ __ ] mama mason
my dad
uh you should go into art because this
picture of a demon is really good
anyways uh so he tells her that
and
after the mom gets scratched on her
forearm she's then possessed by a demon
a demon who is an arsonist
and loves to burn things and so the mom
then sets the old folks home on fire
uh
gets sent to jail yes and then to top it
all
she goes and kills five more people they
also uncovered that she poisoned people
at uh a local church
killed another five that's that's like
oh there's the sanatorium and then
there's the old folks home and then she
kills people there but then she kills
other people and it's like this is way
too convoluted yeah and then she gets
here
arrested and then
throughout her
demonic possession
convulsions
she becomes a cutter and then gives
herself such a traumatic head injury
that she ends up in a coma for 20 years
yeah there and then the demon is unable
to escape
now we're continuing on with the plot
okay
then
catholic
exorcists
disguised as doctors
working in a local community college
have developed this amazing
amazing technology
to
to go inside somebody's head their brain
waves are still working
even though you're in a coma you can go
inside someone else's head
somehow via the magic of computers it's
super advanced technology to talk to a
possessed person through their their
like subconscious and they give her no
instructions on this and she agrees to
do it like immediately
i was surprised by that you think it's
like you'd have to try and convince her
like this is pretty [ __ ] weird but
she's like i'll do it and then she just
goes in there to swear at her elderly
mother
you know what [ __ ] you
what was also was interesting was her
friend slash
ex
yeah martin
remember he texts her and he's like hey
what's up it's me martin
and then she tells her friend sam she's
like martin texted me she's like whoo
girl have some more wine
and he's like he's like meet me at the
patio for coffee
question mark and she's like okay
lol then they meet at the windiest cafe
of all time they meet at the windiest
cafe of all time and then he says
oh
i'm here to tell you that
i was recruited into a study where your
mother is in a coma and they tried to
put a brain scan device on my head so i
could go inside her head and talk to her
in her coma state yeah and the daughter
didn't even know she was in a coma
carly she's in a coma
i mean she's
fully paralyzed
a coma what happened
and he's like i think they're gonna come
try to contact you
because your mom
might be possessed by the devil
so in his text he just meet me for
coffee
how about
i need to talk to you it's really
[ __ ] important yeah
uh yeah she's like she's in a coma
i'll show up you want to put a thing on
my head okay [ __ ] with my brain
sure how about my mom's a sick [ __ ] i'm
out of here yeah and then
yeah they should have to try and
convince her
just immediately
let's get to the
the catholic
uh swat team exorcist rogue militarized
catholic exorcist priests what is their
ultimate plan to kill demons
[ __ ] to kill demons [ __ ]
and how do they accomplish that how is
connecting the daughter to the mother's
brain
in any way going to help accomplish that
well i think isn't there something about
how they discover that am i completely
making this up that they're the the
demon's ultimate goal is to possess the
daughter
like that's his final goal isn't there
something about that
i watched this movie like a day and a
half ago and it's already left my brain
i think that comes up later where he
says he's she's coming after you next
so i got the impression that it was yeah
they need her because that's
the demon's ultimate end goal is to get
into her but shouldn't you want to keep
her away from her then
i i don't know uh because and what do
guns have to do with anything they're
badass
and so part of the plot then revolves
around the mother is i think they're
trying to get
carly
and the mother back to the sanatorium
as the ultimate like
conclusion of the plot because they
think that
that's how the demon can move then if
the demon has to be back in its original
place of possession
okay which is all news to me
uh hey every movie has its own mythology
if that's the mythology in this movie
that's fine um and the demon
uh has to has to
maybe while it's in the middle of flying
into
carly's body that's when they shoot
a non-corporeal entity with machine guns
maybe there's some sort of supernatural
guns i don't know we only saw him for
five seconds and then everyone gets
killed off cameras holy bullets they've
been blessed by priests sure sure but
then they pull out the most ridiculous
thing in the world so the only thing the
only time i laughed out loud the film
oh oh i know what you're getting at the
holy lands which
the holy lands
it's been in the vatican for 1 000 years
which we lead up to with carly shows up
at the place and this is when you're
like oh everybody's dead except for the
one guy who's not quite dead yet he gets
he's alive just enough to give
information that old chestnut that old
cliche
tired as hell
um but yeah it gives her a special
special supernatural dagger well a
thousand years it's been in the
vatican's possession it's the holy lance
it's the magic
thing that will
kill a demon
see this is in movies this is your setup
and payoff we didn't set anything up so
we'll set something up right before we
have to use it
here use this to get to the end of the
movie and if they got that holy lance
then why so many machine guns
and
if their ultimate goal is to kill the
demon
how about
you just
stab old granny who's in a coma with the
holy lance when nobody's looking yeah
yeah you got the body it's not going
anywhere
because remember at the very end
spoilers carly becomes temporarily
possessed by fire demon men and she
stabs herself with the holy lance which
causes the demon to come out of the body
he's got nobody else to possess so he
goes yeah yeah maybe if they stabbed
grandma with the holy lance in the
hospital or the research laboratory
whatever you want to call it then the
demon comes out then it would just kind
of like possess the nearest
nurse or well that's kind of what it
does with possessing the bald dude yeah
okay so again something else that
happens completely off camera
oh hey carly by the way your mom's not
possessed anymore and
the head of our research facility is
right uh yeah
that's the biggest tragedy in this movie
and it's not even presented as a tragedy
that mom's life
that sucks
she just got possessed and then was in a
hospital in a coma for 20 years and then
just [ __ ] dies off camera
that's horrible
if it was presented in the movie as a
tragedy that'd be one thing but they're
like oh we got to move on to killing the
chicken monster with the magic lance
things were tough in canada during covet
i guess no vaccines
demonic demonic possessions
and neil is on
jody foster
oh yeah
at the end she puts on the night vision
goggles to hunt down the battery oh yeah
and i thought
jody foster did that in the silence of
the lambs
jody foster was in elysium
oh that's right
that's something it's something
i wasn't really as into
paranormal horror
that much um i mean i like the exorcist
and i love the shining
um
and this is where i got really confused
right
because she has that nightmare where her
friend sam comes over and lets herself
in at three and well first she lets
herself in hey babe oh what the [ __ ]
what the [ __ ] sam jesus you could have
killed me you just let yourself in
and then she's like okay i'll leave
and then at 3am she's like
pounding on the door and it's and then
she comes over and she's let me show you
it's 3am i just came by to check on you
this is definitely not a fakeout
jumpscare scene it's not a dream and
then she gets weird and she's like she
puts on an old-timey the uh what it is
yeah those are actual medical masks
they were used in the old-timey
tuberculosis days
and i guess the idea is that that's kind
of what the demon looks like too so it's
the connection there the big chicken the
giant chicken and then she's like
there's the body contortion and then she
wakes up and then they cut to
a computer monitor and
bad guy bald bad guy and all of his
that's when we introduced the
black ops uh vatican
exorcist soldiers yeah and they're
watching they have a camera feed in
their bedroom
oh yeah and then i thought for a second
i'm like is she still in the simulation
is the is the cruddy like like uh uh
previz kind of like um you know whatever
that
junkie the virtual reality virtual
reality kind of like look was that like
was that like a front
and then the actual like uh vr
experience looks identical to reality
yeah and i'm like oh she's and i thought
they were going to cut to the hospital
and do like a pullback and show both
women lying in the beds that would have
been a twist and i'm like
that's pretty cool
and then i i guess not they just set up
creepy security cameras in her house
keeping an eye on her because she's
going to get possessed i guess or
whatever
they
i mean that's fine
they could have set that up you know
somebody was in my house
police yeah my door was left open you
have a creepy scene where she sees
someone in the bushes maybe that's a
demon or something right and it turns
out it's just the scientist guys i guess
what should have been an indication
early on that they weren't actually like
scientists medical people
and they're actually undercover rogue
exorcist priests
is uh
carly gets this gigantic [ __ ] cut on
her arm
and it's pretty [ __ ] deep and they
just wrap it in bandages
then we cut to her like making breakfast
and there's just this gigantic open
wound on her arm and she's cooking
breakfast it's like that's pretty gnarly
it seems like they should have done a
little more medical attention to that
thing some stitches maybe yeah yeah
that's a bleed out kind of like it's
really deep that's uh that's that's
that's uh down the street not not across
the tracks yeah that was a proper
suicide cut there
and i seem to just blow it off yeah
well it's because they're not really
doctors
well i had my suspicions when the
technician guy was just tatted up all
over his arms but then i thought i'm
being judgey
it's 20 21
a fully tatted
individual can indeed go into the
medical field i i won't be judgmental
but something about that clearly the
other guy with the beard the bald guy
just by his body language and the way he
acted he's she's like what do you do
here and he's like
i'm a i'm a physician i'm like oh no
you're not you're a you're a devil
worshiper
that would have been an interesting
twist and they were devil worship it was
the exact opposite of what the actual
exact opposite of because they're trying
to bring out the devil from from being
in a trapped in a comatic
uh body that would make more sense if
they're like manipulating somebody like
that
the process of hooking the daughter up
to talk to her
comatic
mother
and then that transferred the demon
through the electrical wires into
carly's brain yeah well yeah they can't
the demon's stuck in this coma victim so
he can't get the demon out so we got to
get her daughter back to
that makes the whole movie makes so much
more sense
she like sits up in the bed and and then
the the technicians walk in and they
take off their lab coats and they have
like black suits on with like a
pentagram yeah
our lord and master
has arrived and
she's like the dark phoenix
and only her friend martin and sam can
save the day
sam's the girl sam's the girl she gets
burnt up in the truck at the end and
carly gets over that immediately sorry
sam sorry sam bye
she tried to get that's funny like she
they laid her in the back of the truck
and then at some point the demon set the
truck on fire but she was like halfway
out of the truck
oh we should have left the doors
unlocked
schwoops
they had to kill her off because there
could be no one alive to become
possessed by the chicken
i guess uh so a little clunky uh not not
very well acted not
very well written
in terms of
characters the characters were flat no
backstory
very very
very
unconnected to the audience backstory
the mother-daughter relationship we
didn't really get much from that
could have spent a little more time on
that
a little less time walking around
looking
in the dark drinking wine in the valley
wine
so yeah
i kind of found this movie dull
um like i said
it exposes neil blomkamp's
weakness which is
a
kind of a
maturely written
story this kind of felt like a like a
junkie red box movie cliche yeah that's
the other thing too is like his movie's
usually
at least distinct visually and this
looks like it's directed with like no
interest in making the movie that you're
making everything's so flat he
he operates well with
more money more access to visual effects
better actors
you probably benefit from a different
writer too
yeah kind of like that's how i always
felt about rob zombies movies too where
it's like he's got some interesting
ideas visually and casting wise but he
should not write his scripts but he
writes all of his scripts and they're
all terrible yeah i gave it a chance i
was curious because of the extremely low
scores
from from a fairly well established
director you see low scores like that on
like junk oh sure and you're like okay
yeah i'm not watching that but then it's
like okay well what what is this
you know
um what did this guy make i'm curious
i'd be curious to look at the the
rotten tomato scores for his movies and
see if they just keep going down with
each movie
if that's the case bring a bring a chart
up right now
because i think that might be the case
district 9 very well liked elysium not
liked as much
chappie no and then this is like 15
percent
anyways ah so yeah i would recommend to
skip
there really isn't much to learn from
this no or
much to gather from it or any
entertainment value whatsoever if it
went overboard into schlock with the old
like rogue priests angle
with their guns and stuff like that's
what i thought it was gonna go
like then it would at least have some
sort of entertainment value from just
how ridiculous it is but like i said
they're killed off screen immediately
which was
disappointing
so yeah
that's that that's that
i'm going to switch off the news
websites and go back to our live secret
camera feed of mr plinkett in his house
okay
oh there he is on the screen
oh
looks like he's coming too
oh
hello
could somebody take me to the hospital
i need to be put on a ventilator
hello
oh i just got an alert
our hazmat suits have arrived [ __ ] yeah
get your needles and vials already
because it's time to go take some
samples of mr plinkett's blood
to be concluded next time when we do a
movie review with a wacky wraparound
skid
hello hello
hello hello hello hello
what
what hello who is that
are you a ghost
show yourself spirit
show yourself
um i
i compel you in the name of jesus christ
take me to a ventilator
