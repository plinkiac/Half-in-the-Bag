and we're back are we what do we want to talk about next where are we at I got one one other movie and then I'm out oh
God and then I got TV shows lots of TV shows which I'll kind of quickly talk about because TV shows are complicated along and yeah I don't want to start
babbling but uh I know you like body spotty's bodies
list right I didn't as in Iowa State as they look on the internet you guys this
is me oh whoa that was one of those movies where you see the trailer and
you're like nope are they in on the joke you're always gaslighting me you're [ __ ] trigger you are so toxic relax
relax you're silencing me and it turns out they are well you see Pete Davidson here and well that's yeah nope some but
similar to The Suicide Squad Ricci Pete Davidson and you're like oh oh good he's
out already uh now I love this movie this is a surprise yeah this is again
like uh the menu a movie where it's it's more of a social satire than yes than
any sort of like I don't know I I you hear that dialogue in the trailer and you're like is this a joke I can't tell
Zoomers but no by the time you get to the end it's like the perfect build up once the
the uh explanation of how this all started is revealed it makes everything retroactively so much funnier yeah it
has a good tone to it too like this uncomfortable tone yeah um because there's there's all these
characters and they're all like kind of rich kids and you get this vibe that there's something underlying in their
relationships and then it turns into like they play this game uh that turns into like a slasher movie
or whodunit kind of thing and it's it's kind of Twisted and fun and entertaining and I wasn't expecting that
um and and I I don't mind Pete Davidson as an actor I didn't see king of Staten Island I don't know if I could handle a
feature with them but his public Persona is annoying but his acting I don't mind yeah so like the Tom Cruise effect where
it's like he's weird in real life you knowing and but but on screen he's playing a character and
he does his job and uh he's uh he's fine in it and I really enjoyed it
oh God I have a transition out of this real
quick oh okay um to one of my favorite shows this year this show called
Fleischmann is in trouble Toby Fleischman awoke one morning inside
the city he lived in all his adult life uh Lizzie Kaplan Jesse Eisenberg Adam
Brody and Claire Danes and it's based on a novel which which is a a perfect example of a
novel Done Right In not that I've read the novel but it's a eight episode long
thing so it really feels like they probably we're getting into detail thing about things but not going on too long
yeah or rushing it yeah in a two-hour movie so um it's very witty very well
acted it's the first like six episodes are all from his perspective
Claire Danes plays his wife and they get a divorce and she's like a talent
manager she doesn't care about her kids and she's very cold and um he's like a
he's a doctor but he's very like passionate about his work and he the work with patients and you know and blah
blah blah blah and she's very like like money oriented she's much money and you always see everything from his
perspective and their life kind of falls apart and they get a divorce and then um
uh Lizzie Kaplan Adam Brody play uh Jesse eisenberg's like college
buddies who are all grown up they're all in their 40s so it's like a coming of middle-aged story uh where they're kind
of free of all of them are reevaluating their lives like we're in our early 40s and you know everyone's kind of
evaluating stuff but Claire Danes uh just disappears for like weeks and then Jesse Eisenberg
saddled with the kids and he's like I don't know what the [ __ ] to do I'm so mad and uh
I joked around that the show should be called my so-called wife
cleverly I joked around until you hit the Claire Danes episode
where you get her side of the story and it's it it rips your soul out oh it's a
little Russian where uh it it tells the same story from different perspectives at a certain
point okay it's a great coming of middle age story um done in eight parts that's for mature
audiences it's not for Zoomers on tick tock
they're evaluating the choices that they've made that led them to that point and settling into the idea that this is
the rest of your life so it seems like it's a good book um but I haven't read it
because I don't read I watch Ant-Man movie
well you've given me two uh Segway
options we're at a fork in the road this is like a Choose Your Own Adventure I can either go from speaking of not made
for Zoomers or I could go coming of middle age
coming to middle aged okay I watched clerks three
you can't catch my breath man oh [ __ ] Mr Dante I need an ambulance at the Quick
Stop like a lot of people of our uh our age Our Generation they have a very long
and complicated history with Kevin Smith clerks was a very important movie to me that was like oh you can just make stuff
it was a very important movie to me as a teenager so this is like you get to this and it's like well I guess I gotta watch
it right I don't want to be too mean and call it
pathetic but I guess I just did oh
kind of awful in a really like baffling and fascinating way because got good reviews did it I think
so did it get good reviews from his die-hard fans because it seems to be the only people he's appealing to anymore or
catering to anymore which I guess is fine he kind of knows his place he knows his audience and he's just making stuff
directly for them which is kind of why I lost interest years ago I had more
interested and when he started to do like weird [ __ ] he did that red State movie it seemed like he branched out yeah
and they're not great but they're interesting and they're kind of weird and they're definitely different for him what's the hockey movie girls with
hockey sticks oh yoga hosters that's one of the worst things I've ever seen but that's like that was met with such harsh
criticism there it's like okay I'll go back and do a Jane sound bar movie I just this movie is and it's obviously
based on what really happened to him he had his heart attack and in the movie of the two
clerks there's Dante and Randall Randall has a heart attack and says oh I've got a I survived my heart attack I've got a
new lease on life I want to make a movie about us working in the convenience store so you get self-reflective of him
making the original clerks so it gets a little meta it gets it's the whole middle of the movie is just them making
the original Clerks and it's meant to make you so make you say I remember that I remember that so
Randall has a heart attack that's the inciting incident of the movie and then in the third Act of the movie
spoilers well first of all do you remember the second movie at all I don't think I ever
saw it well Dante ends up marrying Rosario Dawson oh I did see it which is the most unbelievable thing um so that's
how it ends uh he marries her she's pregnant this movie starts off because they can't afford Rosario Dawson anymore
for more than one day so she's dead and the back story is she died while
pregnant so Dante since the end of the second movie he's just been miserable because the baby die his wife an unborn
baby died and so the whole movie is great way to start off your comedy exactly well that's the whole thing is like he wants
to tug at your heartstrings and make you cry so that's the start of the movie then Randall has a heart attack and wants to
make a movie so Dante helps him make the movie and then in the third Act of this movie Dante also has a heart attack and
he dies what's that saying right what you know I guess but everyone has a heart attack everyone has a heart attack
does everyone wear embarrassing clothes but that's the thing is like so Rosario
Dawson she has a quick Cameo where it's like he's sort of talking to her in in kind of a dream form and her whole thing
she's saying to him like I died it's tragic but I died you you can still
write the next chapter of your life you know you have to move on do something else with your life but then he doesn't
he just gets into an argument and disavows his friendship with Randall and then dies and that's the movie It's So
baffling because it's like if he had a heart attack at the beginning of the movie and that's his new lease on life I'm gonna
make a movie like narratively that makes sense but having his friend be the one to have the heart attack and want to
make the movie and then he's just miserable the whole time and then he just dies like what he's saying
narratively what is the point of any of this two heart attacks other both characters have a heart attack other
than to make your Die Hard audience say I remember these characters and now one
of them died so that makes me sad but narratively what's the purpose of it it's only one man who can answer that
question Jay Christopher Nolan Christopher Nolan this new film Oppenheimer I'm sure Kevin
Smith can explain his reasoning behind all this and has probably done that on a podcast that went on for five hours I
think it needs more weed uh oh my other segue would have been
something that doesn't appeal to Zoomers very quickly I watched weird the alienkovic story
very very funny yeah but I can't imagine if you don't know anything about the history of Weird Al or the history of
80s pop music like Madonna all these people I can't imagine you getting anything out of this because that's the
whole movie he's just playing on jokes and your expectations of these people it's a fake fake uh fake fake
biopic movie it's uh it's very very funny um the kind of Comedy that isn't made
now where it's just jokes non-stop from beginning to end doesn't take anything seriously if
you're a fan of Weird Al if you're a fan of his humor if you like UHF this is right in that same vein nice nice don't
have a lot to say about it other than it made me laugh pretty consistently for 90 minutes and then I was out thank you
well I'm gonna run through my favorite TV shows now that we've come back from our commercial break
I just found out a show that I really loved was is canceled by Netflix it's called 1899.
they're still alive oh yeah they canceled it after one
season because they're Netflix yeah I saw one comment saying that the the
material was very close to something else and there's the Netflix was where
they were going to be sued but I don't know how much weight that carries no uh because it's just a silly internet
comment and I have no idea but this is the stranger things hasn't been sued for ripping off everybody then nothing will
but 1899 it's a big ship looks like the Titanic uh and there's all a bunch of
people on board from all different races and classes and languages and they all
speak different languages um don't watch the English dubbed version because it looks horrible I'll
watch it with subtitles never watched an English dub 25 of it is English the rest of it's dubbed
um but it's it was fantastic I really enjoyed it I would compare it to many different
things uh which could give away spoilers so I'll say spoilers for 18.99 uh
Matrix uh dark city Titanic
uh Science Fiction it's good I enjoyed it but they canceled it but you know
what I'm like a cliff Cliffhanger it doesn't end on a cliffhanger it ends on a like we're entering a new chapter okay
that's kind of what that archive 81 show ended that way too and then that didn't get picked up where I was like if it was
a movie I would have been satisfied with the ending okay it's sort of like oh is
it all all a dream kind of an ending but it was still like an ending yeah where you've got an answer when you don't get
an answer that's what's annoying but it got you got an answer and it was a fun little journey and so I was I'm okay
with it being canceled um because to me it was a long movie uh uh classic favorites that are in their
subsequent Seasons beyond the first one which aren't new shows ghosts evil
and what we do in the shadows uh consistently funny what we do in the shadows I think is one of the better
comedies I've seen I need to catch up I've only seen the movie which I like the movie ghosts is cute it's not uh
it's not risky it's it doesn't offend a place it's safe
the American ghosts the British ghost is much better but the American Ghost is pretty good it's like it's like uh I
don't know comedy on TV I watched loot
with Maya Rudolph is that a quibby original oh [ __ ] suck I watched there's a show
called Blockbuster oh I wasn't even a show called Blockbuster premiering on Netflix right
yes about the last I wasn't going to touch that [ __ ] it [ __ ] sucked so much
first episode out the first episode out under the test again soon you sure you
need to get out of your lane and into Diane Lane Blockbuster I I don't understand the
Nostalgia for Blockbuster I mean I guess that was like the chain and everybody went there I always even back when
Blockbuster was around I hated Blockbuster their AI scoured the internet and found that there was some
traction with like the last Blockbuster yeah that kind of stuff but there's a video star Nostalgia yeah it was the
committee or an AI figured it out and said let's make a show about the the block but does it take place at the last
Blockbuster or does it take place in the past when Blockbusters were it's the last Blockbuster and it has a cast of
wacky characters and and I'm assuming that was canceled after the first time I
don't even know I just just like get it away from me like I threw it down a mine shaft like like comedy on TV it's not
even funny yeah it's there's no jokes it's everything played so safe
you know the days of the office are long gone yeah oh and then I watched the
Quantum Leap reboot sucks you're the only one gone
sucks um it's not a does it have connections to the original show so it is like kind
of a continuation kind of a continuation but um uh the lady who played Elle's wife is in
it from the original series uh this they talk about Sam Beckett and you know blah
blah blah blah but [ __ ] it [ __ ] it um I also did watch for those of you
bothering me about it I did watch strange new Worlds the Star Trek show oh my God this is this is important news
foreign I got through one and a half episodes and had to stop not that it was
atrociously bad but the premise of the first one was so [ __ ] ludicrous and stupid I I can't
even wrap my head around it but I think the real problem with with
the new Trek and me is the writing of the characters
and I'll be real brief about this is like the people that are in Starfleet
have always been mature and had poised
and were intelligent and acted like adults and in Brave New worlds they're all
doing their thing but it's always like they always got to have a quip or they act like teenagers running around and
they laugh and they do they say something funny because they don't want the audience to get bored and so I'm
like I can't deal with characters that are that act like teenagers when they should be professional level
military personnel in a space exploration vessel I love this job they
shouldn't laugh and make little stupid asides all the time constantly I'm like
I can't deal with this I'm done I can't I can't take these characters seriously make Star Trek boring again hashtag make
Star Trek boring again do it we Dare You cowards
tell me what you got Jay uh well I
watched the Fable men's oh right uh pretty good movies
definitely Beth Spielberg movie I've
seen in Forever forever aside from of course Ready Player One visual puke in a while in a while this
is like you hear the premise and you're like oh The Coming of Age movie it's Spielberg autobiographical about growing
up and making amateur backyard movies and you kind of have this vision of like okay super small C super uh tug at your
heartstrings and it really isn't that stuff's kind of downplayed and it's a little more straightforward than that
and surprisingly eccentric lots of weird little quirks that I'm guessing are autobiographical because there's so many
weird little details where like why would that be in just a regular movie so it has a little more personality than I
was expecting but it is uh it is very Charming I mean you're seeing him I I believe that all the stuff with him
making movies is actual movies that he made when he was a kid little eight millimeter movies yeah like you did a
war movie and stuff like that yeah because it feels like this is almost his way of remaking his childhood amateur
movies and making them better in a way um but it gets to a point where it's not really about about him making movies
anymore it's about his family and this they're the Fable men's but Loosely based on him not the most flattering
portrayal of his parents it's basically about their marriage falling apart and them being miserable and awful to each
other but how that affects him and his desire to make movies there's a whole portion where he's not making movies
anymore and he's kind of gets back into it when he gets a little bit older but it's very anti-schmaltz in a way you get
to the end spoilers but not really because it's not really related to The Narrative but he ends up out in
Hollywood he he's in a position where he gets to meet they say do you want to meet the greatest filmmaker that ever
lived he's he's right across the hallway they take him across the hallway and it's David Lynch but he's not
playing David Lynch he's playing John Ford so it has this like double meeting but he's in his office waiting for John
Ford to show up and they're panning around the room there's all this schmaltzy music you see all the posters
for like the Searchers and how green is my Valley all these John Ford movies and there's this like uplifting dramatic
music and then David Lynch as John Ford walks in and he did a full-blown non-ironic record scratch
and it was great
you don't do a record scratch unless you're us and you do it because it's so stupid that it's funny but he did it and
it works and John Ford comes in and he's got like lipstick all over his face because he's been probably fooling
around with young actresses that he's taken advantage of uh and so it becomes this like complete
anti-schmaltz anti-like Whimsical view of Hollywood so it's very the whole
movie is like that too where it's a lot more uh uh kind of dark and downbeat than you would expect without without
dwelling on it it's not depressing movie now remember this when the Horizons at the bottom it's
interesting when the Horizons at the top it's interesting
when the Horizons in the middle it's boring as [ __ ] it's very good and the performances by
his parents it's Paul Dano and uh uh Michelle Williams both characters are
like in the hands of a lesser filmmaker or a lesser uh less lesser performances could come
across like over the top because she's very like quirky and they play it great so
surprisingly good movie I was I was uh pleasantly surprised by it
thank you
did you watch the Midnight Club I didn't I watched the first episode and I was gonna get around to more it seemed like
based on the first episode that it was aimed at maybe a younger audience I know it's based on books that are like why a
books yeah and it's interesting um after midnight mass something so heavy
and amazing great yeah I I really liked it and it was very different from his
other stuff and you said it seemed like a y a thing and that's because all the
kids are teens in it and it's nothing like super like crazy or spooky
um but good characters and I think like had it gone on to season two or three it would have progressed their story lines
I I understand why they didn't want to pursue it I I haven't imagined their Netflix robots
there's all their decisions are based on analytics people like you who gave it one episode and said I'm out I didn't
say this out I was like I'll get to it eventually but oh sure but yeah it's like I was with Midnight Man yes they know that they know that people probably
watched a couple and dropped off because so you're trying to say it's my fault that the show was canceled kind of I'm
sorry Mike Flanagan you're dropping the bucket but you have uh it has a little
like um demographic gray area problem which I get you know it's unfortunate
because it was well made and um well written and good characters and yeah I
could have I could have enjoyed watching them grow and um see what else happens in in this show
but uh kind of confused because it's like
partially a straightforward story about these characters coming together at this place this facility but then kind of an
anthology thing too because they tell stories but not a full Anthology but we get little glimpses of the stories
they're telling yeah so it's like is the show an anthology as a little confused not really it's it's you know how
they're laying camps in it yeah she's the director of the it's like a hospice house you know cancer kids go and
they're like teenagers and they all meet at midnight and it's them in the stories and blah blah the one of the funnier
things that you might appreciate is I think they were saying you need more
jump scares so he intentionally added like 58 jump scares in the first episode
or something like that first couple episodes as a way of like like making some kind of record of the
most jump scares in in this amount of time just to kind of like [ __ ] with them
foreign
but my last thing that I'll mention that I'm currently watching I and I don't know why I just said I'm I'm just going
to watch the first episode of this it's an AMC original I think it's over I think when two
seasons uh it's called Kevin can [ __ ] himself
you've probably never heard it I've never even heard of it
Hey where's all breakfast you're not supposed to have favorites Kevin's my husband It's oddly fascinating you would
find it fascinating okay uh you turn it on and it's a sitcom and the guy who
plays Kevin an actor named Eric Peterson he is the hammiest think like Ralph
Kramden like on steroids okay he plays the best like hammed up uh sitcom guy
but his wife uh her character's name is Allison
and their set is the All in the Family set okay it's identical it's amazing but
when they cut to her and her storyline it's very serious and there's like drugs and she wants to kill him and it's all
like Darkly and Moody moodly lit oh you're selling me on those and then it when it cuts back to him
it's corny sitcom with laugh track but I'm native elsewhere
oh okay that's never explained why the format is like this she's not crazy yeah
it's just that's how the show is okay and I could just imagine showing this to
like Grandma or your parents or whatever and just what because it starts off with
this the sitcom and the sitcom is just like it's like perfectly done and then it just hard cuts and sometimes
it's in the same like shot where she'll get hit by something and then it'll boom it'll jump from sitcom to like dark AMC
drama back and forth back and forth and then the the the the the plot he has his
wacky like sitcom premises where he's like he's doing some kind of like crazy scheme but he always wins
and she hates him because he's obnoxious he belittles her he's awful he's selfish
and she wants to kill her okay I kind of get like we're in the context of a sitcom this stuff is quirky and funny
but when you look at it in reality her life and her reflection of it is who's
responsible for this nonsense I don't want to watch this watch it it's crazy and I think this the this is the final
season season two okay it was just out recently the last couple years I think it's over I'm I'm still finishing I'm
like episode three or four season two but but but you'd appreciate it from
from a technical perspective because sometimes the exact same set and the exact same scene how they're lit and
shot is obviously dramatically different and how how much the lighting set up for
the sitcom scene the exposure the colors yeah versus the the the you know the
depth of field the way that's shot the dingy desaturated look of the exact same
set and scene from one shot to the next is just dramatic and and it's just from a
filmmaker's perspective yeah this sounds great uh watch watch the first episode you'll get the gist from the first
episode and you can decide if you want to continue on with it um or not fantastic
uh well my last movie my favorite movie of last year what a great way to end our
show everybody yeah and this may not be this episode not the show for all of you
who thought that the last half of the bag was the last one ever and only four people cared
yeah that's weird that people thought the last episode was like the last episode it kind of felt like it I guess
don't worry when we're done there's not going to be a last episode it's just gonna stop there just won't be any more
and then you'll have to figure out what to do with the rest of your life anyways what was your favorite movie of
2022. ah this would probably be of no surprise to people that have seen it bones and all no Dylan was like the year
before that but Timothy Shelby connection bones and all do you know what this
movie's about Buffalo Wild Wings try that
uh no bones and all a uh Coming of Age road trip young lover
romance cannibal film
and that's why I didn't watch it yeah I just wasn't in the mood it's It's A Hard movie to recommend because it's very
like it's directed by Luca guaranino when I saw an Italian name I knew it was about cannibals
well he did he's most famous I think for doing call me by your name big Academy award-winning vampires movie no no not
vampires uh but he did zombies no they're just cannibals they're just
normal people that happen to be cannibals call me by your name though call me well that called me by your name that's the love movie with um the
cannibal that ironically has a real life yeah but no he was got famous for that and I guess he's kind of used that oh I
was thinking of Let the Right One In oh okay yeah tell me by your name Let the Right One In is a vampire movie that's
that's what I confused it with so I'm not I'm not demented yet I'm on the way
but I'm not quite there yet okay okay uh but no look at Nino seems to have taken
whatever Cloud he had from that movie call me by your name Academy Award nominations of one some I think and use
that to just make really understated weird [ __ ] up movies because he did
the Suspiria remake which I love that movie I like it more than the originals Xperia I know now he's made this
mostly kind of warm and sweet love story where the two people just happened to
also be cannibals and it doesn't shy away from the cannibal angle which is why it's hard to recommend because it's legitimately
grotesque in parts um but it it somehow pulls off being violence and
gross but never taking you out of liking these characters because it's very uh it's
focused on them there's a slight Supernatural angle where cannibals can like just sense other cannibals which is
sort of odd that's the only kind of like vaguely Supernatural thing so this girl goes off on the road her dad basically
is like I can't deal with the cannibalism [ __ ] I'm out of here and abandons her so she kind of goes off on
the road meets up with Timothy xiaomi oh you're also a cannibal they fall in love they meet Mark rylands they meet Mark
rylance who's great in the movie that's actually the first one the first one she meets is him and he seems like
can you trust him is he he's kind of creepy but maybe he's just like dim-witted it's hard to tell
um and that becomes a part of the movie too that's the thing about me well that's true are you also a cannibal no
oh okay I am done with it and creepy so yeah no but it's just told In This Very like gentle way it's never trying to be
a horror movie so it's like yeah I wasn't sure like Declassified this as a horror movie not really but uh just yeah
these it all takes place in the midwest they're traveling across country beautiful just like Stark Midwest
nothing uh shots and just these two people two Outsiders finding each other
that also happen to be cannibals Great Performances the whole time I was watching I thought the lead actress was
the little girl from Dr sleep speaking of Mike Flanagan because she was good in
that movie and Dr sleep and I was like oh it's Fierce now she's a little bit older taking on a a more mature role the
whole time I thought it was her and then it isn't her it's the lead actors from that escape room movie but no bones and
all if you can handle the the grotesque aspects of the movie it does a great job of portraying that stuff very
matter-of-factly but not in a like we're trying to be shocking or gross just like
this is the world of this movie it's interesting it's very it's a very unique tone I don't know what else to
compare it to I know what to compare it to Romeo and Juliet
oh my God oh my God you did it you did it
that's why I get paid the big bucks what's up Lex for us Jay uh death
I could be doing a small voice Cameo and an upcoming film
uh but it's it's in the early negotiations phase my lawyers are talking to their lawyers and their
agents are talking to their lawyers agents oh and uh but you know it's
it's directed by Christopher oh oh did he Christopher read the script
oh Top Hat monkey goes west I'm playing the monkey no who's playing the top hat
s okay for a couple of weird close-ups where is where the monkey
is performing oral sex on Mark rylance
I have a feeling those scenes will be cut though in the final edit because no one wants to watch that in IMAX
