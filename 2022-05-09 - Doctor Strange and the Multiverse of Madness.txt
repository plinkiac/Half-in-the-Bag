well thank god for my netflix stock
every night
i dream the same dream
dr strange in the multiverse of madness
is the 28th marvel movie in 14 years in
addition to that there's been five tv
shows made for disney plus in the last
two years hey did you know that the
james bond franchise has been around for
almost 60 years and there's been 27
movies in that time don't know why that
popped into my head anyway well mike we
ventured out back to the
the beautiful
majestic magical movie theater we got
the full theatrical experience our first
time back since uh ghostbusters
afterlife it's true and it's exactly the
same as it's always been i think my
least favorite phrase in the english
language is only in theaters
well you know i thought i was okay with
skipping the batman because it's three
hours i watched that clip of the joker
i didn't understand what anyone was
saying that deleted seat or they're just
mumbling the whole time i was like well
i deleted those so there's a prop
propaganda that was a con that was to
see if there's interest in another joker
yeah and i was like two minutes oh i
watched that and it was four hours later
i'm like what are they talking about i
can't understand anyone i can't see
anyone
no one's in focus i can't see the batman
i don't i can't i don't understand what
the batman is saying i don't know what
this guy's saying it's like in front of
the lens they put uh uh mr magoo's
glasses and just shot the movie through
that
well they were it was artistically done
to disguise the joker's appearance i get
that i get that i'm not just stupid i'm
not stupid
but um well i thought going to see
doctor strange for you would be a nice
kind of
uh reprieve
from uh star trek picard but then
god damn it that old bag bones patrick
stewart showed up in this movie oh it's
from trauma
drama get away from me
get away
no no um it's funny you mentioned that
because
i went back and i watched and this will
be a three-part review i suppose i went
back and i watched
spider-man far from home and
no way home
in preparation for this one yes because
i know that no way home sort of deals
not really with the multiverse i don't
even know what that is the multiverses
uses just a gimmick
a gimmick to have have weird characters
show up and things happen uh but after
watching nine hours of star trek picard
uh i [ __ ] loved far from home okay it
was the most refreshing far from home
not no way home uh both okay i but i
loved far from home much better no way
home is good
don't get me wrong uh far from home i
was like oh my gosh he's going on a
field trip with all of his friends it's
a little adventure martin stars there jb
smoove i mean like
and oh but here comes you know they're
saying there's like a story and things
it's not like and it was like it was
light-hearted and it felt like a uh
like a richard donner superman kind of
like when they go to um they go to the
niagara falls you know and
superman superman and just just floating
down the river to the uh you know it and
and all the quips and the jokes and yes
it doesn't take itself seriously but and
and you know like the the third act
twist with uh what i was like oh
mysterio you know he's in this up and
then i had this clever plot with the
little holograms and and i was like
it made sense to me
it was entertaining it had a beginning a
middle and end and i really enjoyed both
films the second uh the third one was a
little darker
i yeah i also watch no way home in
preparation for this because it's
multiverse related i hadn't seen that
one before because i didn't really care
but
i love you guys
thank you
um it was the the world's longest super
bowl commercial that's what it felt like
to me you know when they do those like
expensive commercials where they bring
back
like uh like bill murray and he
recreates groundhog day
you're like i'm watching bill murray i'm
not watching that character i'd rather
not talk about this no i don't mean to
are you teasing me no no no no no he's
not teasing you it's just that i i wish
i could tell you but it's like i don't
do it like i don't
like i don't do breathing like breathing
just happens whoa that's how i felt with
uh uh toby mcguire in this movie i guess
so i the highlight of the movie was
andrew garfield he was funny in it and
and like those guys like they were
talking about the the super villains
they fought and the jokes and
that scene felt to be like an snl skit
they just left it all in all the
rambling uh improv yes the humor seemed
to be a little too self-referential and
kind of unrealistic but i i prefer that
version of spider-man like the andrew
garfield spider-man's were just like
bad and not really fun
the sam raimi spider-mans of course are
great
um and when they showed up in this it
was just like uh it got a little bogged
down and
at the end
well i was gonna say what scaffolding
we'll call it scaffolding scaffolding
actions just like spiderman three yeah
um which i wanted to mention that like i
watched snowy home i thought it was okay
uh kind of forgettable um
but after watching the new doctor
strange i liked it a lot more because
the climax of that movie is yeah just on
a construction site
it's not a cacophony of noise
um which i was very disappointed that
this movie turns into the classic
third act
action movie
endless headache inducing noise fest i
think a lot of that has to do with the
script uh the spider-man movies were
written by
chris mckenna and eric summers wrote a
lot of comedy stuff
uh and this was written by
a name i didn't recognize he did write
for rick and morty so another comedy guy
well that's that's odd because there was
wasn't a lot of comedy in it it took
itself very seriously and and that's
okay for this because
i probably wouldn't want too much like
like
you know what are you
multiverse blah blah blah blah
it wouldn't fit in this type of movie it
works in spider-man because he's just a
kid he's like 16 years old and he
doesn't understand
adulthood you know yeah um and so yeah
well those are like they're like teen
comedies basically yeah and that's kind
of spider-man's gimmick is that he's
quippy and and sarcastic and
all that but
the comedy in this comes from
goofy [ __ ] being played straight the
third act of this movie i noticed in our
theater there was more than once people
were laughing at the movie
and i was thinking to myself sam raimi's
back baby
to protect our world
oh god yeah so you wanted to watch this
because it's directed by sam raymond
which i understand um and there were
some little sam raimi
uh hallmarks that that shone through
the murky noise
it was
pretty much what i expected which was a
sam raimi hired gun to make an mcu movie
that's basically what it is it's a
little weirder
i mean the third act is like
gothic monster
magic nonsense
which is a little bit different well no
well that's where he comes through is
you know you've got on well a spoiler
alert
spoiler alert dr
strange spoiler alert
why are you so angry to give a spoiler
who's out there
who's out there
uh
i mean you have a couple of camera angle
tricks you know these the sam raimi
camera movements
couple of direct nods uh scarlet witch
puts her hand up to a mirror and then it
goes in it like it's water which is
right out of evil dead [ __ ]
at some point she looks like an evil
dead hag i think they're like well we
got some witches in this so we got some
ghouls um at one point
dr strange from a different universe is
dead and he reanimates his corpse and
he's got the
ripped open jaw like you know the the
evil dead bad guy like that
oh an army darkness
well that's one of the parts that people
were laughing at he's given like a like
a heartfelt
uh empowering speech and it's just this
close-up of this rotting corpse talking
yeah and yeah and he's like he's trying
to deliver the dialogue and and he's he
sounds like a pirate
for some reason when anyone's like a
like an undead uh
character in a sam raimi movie they
start talking like a pirate you're right
i don't know why that is pick yourselves
up and sally
i got a bone to pick with you
should sound like more wispy and gross
but they all sound how sam raimi wants
them to sound i'm surprised i'm not just
dubbed over by sam raimi i possessed an
economicon i've crushed a pathetic army
now i'll have my vengeance uh
it felt very long and uh i i i was never
really huge on dr strange
it's weird i remember we did the first
doctor strange movie and i remember
thinking like visually it was
interesting but character wise i didn't
really care about doctor strange right i
liked him more in the movies where he's
like a side character i think he works
better as that i like that he is um
yeah he works good as a side character i
like that he's kind of like annoyed a
lot and crusty that's sort of like his
character traits he's not like
he doesn't act mystical and like
ethereal and he's like i am doctor
strange and he doesn't act too heroic
he's just like what do you want he's
very bruce campbell-ish that's true um
and i like him as a side character and
then in
this uh as as as the lead
they had they had two like
things to ground you
uh emotionally as an audience member and
that's dr strange and
uh
he's is he is still in love with uh
jennifer garner who is that
uh uh rachel mcadams rachel mcadams they
always all these white ladies
rachel mcadams jennifer garner is
elektra remember that hit
there's a little daredevil cameo and uh
no way out there was i like that did
y'all notice that
the daredevil cameo or
whatever
i didn't even notice it
someone had to tell me
you didn't notice it what are you blind
so he
dr strange is in love with jennifer
garner and they want
th
in every universe his romance with her
fails because he's got to be doctor
strange
and then
scarlet witch
wanda maximoff
uh wants to live with her fictional
children which if you didn't watch wanda
vision that whole storyline you'd just
be like what they kind of explain it a
little bit it's fine they explain it
so so it's like the that and then that's
the
the base and then our other character um
a girl named america who
has the power to open up to jump between
multiverses yes nobody else can do it
it's kind of like her mutant superpower
and she but she doesn't really know how
to use it so she's the key
and wanda becomes the villain and wanda
wanda wants to
go into the universe
where
she lives with her fictional children
because she wants to be happy in other
universes those children actually exist
which completely undermines wand
division the show i think she used the
dark arts
uh she used the necronomicon
to look into red bubbles of energy and
she looked into one red bubble
and she saw that
that's where she lived in a happy tv
show with her fake children is that
supposed to be like retroactively that
explains the setup for one division
because that's what when when when
doctor strange opens up the necronomicon
the the little bubbles appear and he
looks around but there's a price to pay
when you play with the necronomicon is
that you get black fingernail tips sure
and you turn
evil and you become obsessed and
uh you become evil spock you become evil
spock yeah
i also noticed in addition to patrick
stewart there's the character of black
bolts that shows up on the council or
whatever in this uh that actor is pike
on the new star trek show anson mount i
guess i had no idea who the [ __ ] he was
i wish my name sounded like a sex
position
that was my favorite scene though when
he gets put in front of the
the the uh the
avengers of a different universe the the
illuminati all that stuff was fun it's a
movie with a
kind of messy and not very engaging
story
but lots of still filled with neat
little things lots of neat little things
yeah yeah that's a good way to put it
and that whole section was great and
gets
surprisingly violent for a marvel pg-13
movie right right
yeah we don't want to talk too much
about that but yeah jim from the office
shows up john krasinski has uh mr
fantastic
i'm assuming he's going to be in the new
fantastic four film
i guess yeah i think they're making one
eventually they're going to make one
that's right of course they're going to
make one and they'll be they're going to
bring back josh trank they're going to
give them another chance
and then there's going to be a movie
about multiverse or they meet those
fantastic fours and the jessica alba
fantastic fours oh my god which will be
really confusing because chris evans is
in that fantastic four right just called
jessica alba's in this one playing
doctor strange's love interest
uh but yeah that sequence that's when we
get the patrick stewart cameo and the
professor x shows up uh professor x
shows up and that was i didn't watch the
x-men animated show in the 90s but they
play his theme for a second yeah that's
like
ultimate pandering but he's in a yellow
his yellow x-men like hover chair
instead of his like stupid metal
brian singer chair
nobody wants to get in the brian singer
chair
so many different wacky crazy set pieces
in this like
uh
the wanda attacking the
the compound with all the wizards
and then the big fight at the end and
then flying through the multiverse and
then
walking around
the
land of oz or something
new york city's become
you know the the munchkin village well
that's that's when they're in the other
universe but well that's that's a
complaint i i assume this movie was
going to be about them like hoppin
universes
they basically go to one other universe
and that's where they spend most of the
movie
there's a quick sequence where they're
kind of falling through them and you see
like one their paints and one it's like
a silent film
i would have liked to have seen like a
little globetrotting adventure where
they go to all these different weird
lands
what
was missing was a montage
they're looking for something and then
you know like you know a scene where
somebody's like like hunting down
something
and they they stopped by you know this
place they stopped by the grocery store
they stopped by the postdoc yeah get a
little a little bit joking i'm trying to
find this kid have you seen him yeah no
mr i haven't
go somewhere else
they're just popping through universes
looking for something
but yeah they go and there's a world of
little people made out of doughnuts
i can't understand what the donut's
saying
out of there you know that's all we got
for that scene move on that there is a
brief sequence where it's like i don't
know you know everything's turning and
the cities are upside down and i think
there's something like that in
spider-man
no way home
reality is collapsing and when it's like
the everything's turning and
there's a lot of in the first doctor
strange movie yeah that that kind of
stuff i get like nauseated and bored
with but i prefer the characters talking
to each other yeah saying lines of
dialogue to each other i mean like
scenes in a movie things in a movie
talking to each other or some are like
really kind of like
forward thrusting storyline that's the
biggest problem with this movie is that
it doesn't
the the wanda plotline just to me felt
kind of junky and weird coming off of
wandavision
because that's a show with like a real
clear idea and a real strong uh kind of
creative vision no pun intended for the
way the show plays out where it's all
about it's it's kind of thoughtful it's
about like grief and her kind of coming
to terms yeah and it's it's really like
driven until it kind of becomes a marvel
movie at the end but for the most part
it's like a genuinely engaging kind of
character story and then you get to this
movie and says ah she's evil now
she's bad lady i think it just kind of
undermines the whole show i think that
would have been a really nice way to
kind of fix this script would be to shrink down a lot of the ultra violent
action and
fighting at the end
and
because the first time dr strange runs
into wanda he goes and sees her and
she's like in a
she's on a farm with sheep and
apple orchards
and it turns out she's it's all an
illusion she's already
the
monster witch had corrupted i felt like
you were missing something so so like a
handful of scenes back and forth where
doctor strange is maybe talking to her
and she's by herself and she's on on the
real farm and
and
we we almost get a like a better recap
of the wanda vision story yeah and she
keeps dreaming of the kids and then
she's like well maybe i'll open up this
book and like the the fall to the dark
side of her character
seeing that happen
almost in real time um
would have made me a little more
sympathetic
to her i did like the fact that she
wasn't like
monster of the week like i'm gorgon the
blah blah and i'm i'm i want
the book
because i'm evil right it wasn't that it
was character both
um
bad good guy bad guy were were
emotionally driven
which is a good start it just the pieces
needed to be rearranged a little and
then some stuff in the heads of the
movie needed to be fleshed out better
yeah especially wanda our main villain
because her being evil
and just because she's
more or less a villain in the comic
books i think she's kind of wavers back
and forth she's yeah one of those well
even though you empathize with her on
wandavision
what she's doing is so extremely [ __ ]
up like she's
a sympathetic character but she is a
villain yeah she started off as a bad
guy in the marvel movies yeah and then
so she's sort of like
a chaotic neutral kind of character um
and so her being the villain in this is
really fitting and kind of neat because
she's so powerful it could have just
been a wand of movie with dr strange as
a supporting character maybe as it is
it's kind of like 60 doctor strange and
then the rest is wanda yeah even though
she's way more interesting than him and
the only thing going for doctor strange
is that his marriage to
jessica chastain didn't quite work out
yeah
and which you don't even really care
about because those two actors have like
zero chemistry together yeah i was like
was she in the first doctor strange
movie she was i i don't remember if they
worked better than that but here it was
like a flat line
your desecration of reality
will not go unpunished
i was curious because it was sam raimi
and he hasn't directed a movie in so
long and there's some fun sam raimi
stuff in it but
it's not a great
follow-up to one division
and it's not a great sam raimi movie
but it's a fine movie
i guess
if it were just like direct to disney
plus i'd say yeah watch it
but as far as a theatrical experience a
lot of people work really hard on this i
know i know all the visual effects and
all those i was excited to see uh uh bob
marowski who's the usual sam raimi
editor i assumed that this was like a
marvel product so we would have nothing
to do with this but good old bob
marowski edited the movie there's a
little uh easter egg when they're flying
through the different multiverses
there's a taxi with a billboard on it
for grindhouse releasing which is bob
marowski's uh film restoration company
you know where the term easter egg comes
from i don't actually
is it a reference to critters too i
don't know it's a reference to the rocky
horror picture show while they were
filming the rocky horror picture show
the cast and crew
it was easter and they decided to have
an easter egg hunt
on the set and
they left their kids in and they all
looked around and found but they didn't
find all of the easter eggs so if you
watch the rocky horror picture show you
can see easter eggs in lots of the shots
like under chairs and
in different spots is this true
i did not know that look it up [ __ ]
you know i liked it enough um i i
thought a lot of it was fun i thought it
could have used a little more humor
um i was really
it was very refreshing to watch those
last two spider-man movies i really
enjoyed them they're funny
um this one did it felt a little darker
for a marvel movie um and it could have
used a little
a little touch of humor here and there
could be pulled some things out
fixed the beginning a little give wanda
some more backstory but
all the um the jumping around while it
didn't go to multiple universes
it didn't didn't
linger too long in each scene before it
moved or set piece before it moved to
the next thing
yeah which kept it going by the time you
get to the third act to me that was a
problem though that's where things felt
really rushed
like there's moments like we say there's
lots of cool things sprinkled throughout
like like undead dr strange making a
cape out of demon ghosts is awesome yeah
but it happens really quick and then it
cuts back to wong or something and then
it cuts to the
americas
chavez it's just like all over the place
it's like ugh
i like the climax of no way home where
it's like everybody's just fighting in a
construction site a little more simple
so yeah
keep it simple because by the end of
this it's just like constant noise again
i like the idea of uh doctor strange and
evil doctor strange are doing their like
music fight
they're like throwing musical notes i
was like this is a really neat idea it
kind of comes out of nowhere because i
don't think doctor strange has any
history of music but that was his his uh
counterpart in that universe was the
musical doctor strange okay well cause
they set it up with uh all the there's a
shot i noticed that very prominently in
the frame was an old-timey like
victrola oh yeah record player yeah and
then he has the piano there and you saw
the piano and so that doctor strange
musical notes are sort of like runes to
him i guess i don't know
it's fine it's visually it's a neat
sequence but it's like a minute long and
then we gotta keep moving
and it's like yeah i guess it just got a
little exhausting towards the end as
opposed to
uh i mean like the evil dead movies have
kind of a
breakneck pace to them but
they're a lot simpler as far as what
they're focusing on
so
cutting back on some things here there
like there's probably a way to write out
that american character altogether but i
guess you gotta have her in there right
i don't know
you gotta have lesbian parents that you
can easily cut out of foreign markets
but they're in there
they're in there everybody seen right
ou
sucked them right out into the
multiverse
that's what china did
can i go now
are you done with me
what else is going on in the marvel
universe
they just finished moon night that show
that literally nobody's watched right i
i saw the trailer for it like a couple
months ago
and i was like oh i like oscar isaac you
know like this looks kind of neat i
forgot all about it it just yeah then i
saw a little still for it on one of my
streaming apps and i was like oh yeah
and then you forgot about it
the story ends there i also saw mac the
knife
in moon knight they were fighting each
other over mcdonald's
he was trying to get his big mac back
he doesn't have that pointy head he
could impale somebody with that thing i
know he's pretty dangerous
moon knight versus mac the mac the
knight right mack the knife
that's the actual song that's the actual
story i think the in the the commercials
they changed it to mac the night they
did yeah yeah yeah yeah to not offend
anyone right right because it's a song
about a a
mobster that kills people with a knife
right
um but uh yeah moon knight versus mac
the knight
sure mcdonald's character
are you trying to reorganize your
keyboard yeah please yeah i gotta i
gotta type an email to my mom for
mother's day all right all right
i told her p9 f12
