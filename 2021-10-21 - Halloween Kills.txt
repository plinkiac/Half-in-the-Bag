been haunting this town for 40 years
40 years ago we've been haunted for 40
years
40 years ago it started 40 years ago for
40 years i've waited for him to return
evil dies tonight evil dies tonight he
dies tonight
evil dies tonight we're going to end
this tonight and i'm the one that needs
to kill it michael will be stopped
tonight he's been waiting for tonight
tonight tonight evil

maybe we'll find him tomorrow
or next halloween
in the same week william shatner is
launched into space on top of a giant
penis
oh jesus
his likeness in the form of michael
myers is launched on a streaming service
called peacock
coincidence
i think not i recall a time when marge
simpson once tried to explain what a
coincidence was to homer she said homer
it's just a coincidence like that guy
named anthony michael hall who stole
your car stereo hey
speaking of homer simpson it's like he
wrote this script i don't want you
stalking anyone tonight jamie lee curtis
and her hospital bed star in halloween
kills a new horror film from director
david gordon green
a director who has proven he's got the
chops for comedy i mean horror
this sequel to a remake of two failed
reboots from four films erased from an
alternate timeline has an all-star cast
too
horror legend judy greer returns as
karen
and katie holmes returns as daughter
also starring in the film is danny
mcbride and anthony daniels as an
offensive gay couple
darlene connor stars as the boyfriend
the old nurse from the first halloween
the old sheriff from the first halloween
little unnamed girl from the first
halloween and others as the angry mob
i wish i could say halloween kills
thrills
but halloween kills sucks when
describing a horror movie to your
friends and you have to say it's kind of
like titanic meets it's a mad mad mad
mad world
it's not a good sign
jay what did you think of halloween
kills i thought this movie
sucked
uh
i think we both liked the 2018 movie
well enough it was fairly competent in
the commodore uh it was a reboot like a
refreshing of the timeline
skipped from the first one to this one
yeah completely skipped part two which
is where they introduced that lori and
michael are brother and sister right
which uh
h2o still incorporated that and that was
another reboot that ignored the sequels
how were they brother and sister in the
first one like she just lived in a
different house she got adopted i don't
remember the details when you get
adopted you live a block away from your
birth parents how does that work i never
really understood that no well that was
something john carpenter just pulled out
of his ass well drunk one night he said
he wrote the script drunk because he had
no ideas
he just saw a [ __ ] return to the jedi
or something
that's just
familiar relations and i was talking
about the ewoks
yeah anyways uh oh but yeah so 2018
has its problems but for the most part
it got the character of michael myers
better than a lot of the sequels it
stripped him down to what made him scary
and intimidated in the original movie
which is that he's just a mindless
killer with no motive and no reasoning
with and he just keeps moving and
killing and they did that really well
and this movie i guess that's the best
thing about it is that michael myers is
still
they don't try to add any backstory or
any stupid [ __ ] he's still just an
endless killing machine but they do add
some kind of little thing because
they're like he has to go home
he has to stare out the window he once
stared out as a six-year-old that's all
they do they don't introduce
extra siblings or dumb [ __ ] like that so
that's the
best thing about the movie the worst
thing about the movie is that all the
people that he kills are [ __ ] awful
they're poorly written
uh there's no
character growth or
motivation beyond we have to stop
michael myers it's 90 minutes of
characters saying the same [ __ ]
dialogue over and over
he's we have to stop him tonight evil
dies tonight
evil dies tonight evil dies tonight
infected your family he's infected my
family with grief and fear for 40 years
because 40 years ago when i was a kid
you protected me 40 years ago
i remember him from 40 years ago this
man is a threat and we need to stop him
tonight but now it needs to die we're
gonna hunt him down and we're gonna put
an end to this and i'm the one that
needs to kill it he's gonna die tonight
evil
dies
tonight it's crazy because the the first
like 20 minutes i was kind of enjoying
because it is like a direct continuation
off of
the last one like you know it's not like
laurie goes to the hospital i thought
that was gonna happen like the house
burns and then like you know the camera
shows the basement and michael's gone
kind of like how the first one ended
laurie's in the hospital then six months
later you know she's recovering she's at
her a new house or something and and
then you know it's just the same thing
and it's like the same thing again but
it was almost like the same it's like
the same night it's continuation of
halloween night
and which is what the original halloween
two did as well we also ended up in a
hospital yeah and there was a hospital
element there and then halloween four
had an angry mob tracking down michael
myers
it's almost like there's no ideas for
the stupid franchise they cherry pick
things and kind of put them in this but
i was like oh oh like what's going on
like they're on the back of a pickup
truck and lori's bleeding i'm like oh
right right right and then they cut
they're like oh well we need some more
characters so let's um bring anthony
michael hall in as
kid tommy doyle tommy doyle and then uh
how real housewives lady
lindsey wallace was the little girl okay
so refresh me on this in the first
halloween
lori is babysitting two kids yeah well
her friend annie brackett pushes one of
the kids off so she ends up babysitting
too okay so there's only two kids right
and then we also introduce uh uh one of
the kids that bullied tommy doyle in the
beginning of halloween when they pushed
him down and he lands on his pumpkin and
cracks it open right
the kid with the red jacket bully his
name is
uh lonnie lonnie
lonnie has also grown up and so in a in
a weird kind of scene that opens the
movie
uh ish is
they're all at the local bar
karaoke night
at the local bar
and tommy doyle brings the mood down
by
going up on stage
and i'm just picturing everyone being
like he does this every saturday yes and
that's the thing is this did not happen
two years ago
this happened 40 years ago when he was
ten or eight or six however old he was
yeah and and
i'm sorry murder is bad
but a couple people got murdered in
1978.
well that's the thing in the in the last
one 2018 movie they have the character
who says that and we're like oh that's
nice that they brought that up and this
movie completely undermines that and has
every single character in the town of
haddonfield obsessed with michael myers
right it's it's insane
i think the idea with that bar scene is
that lindsey wallace uh uh lonnie
the real housewives oh that's that's
lindsay wallace tommy doyle
like this is something they do every
halloween well that's the weird thing
they all get together to commiserate or
whatever and just kind of be together on
this
anniversary of this tragic night but
they're also there with the elderly
nurse that's in the opening of the
original halloween for five seconds her
interaction with michael myers is that
her car was stolen
why does she know these people why is
she friends with them she's [ __ ] 40
years older than them
there are other characters marion the
nurse it's so weird it's so like
desperate yeah like this franchise has
nothing so we'll bring back every single
tiny character and they all know each
other and they're all best friends and
they all have nothing in their lives
other than michael byers that's where it
breaks the
rules of reality a little because yeah i
like that line in the first one i think
it's one of the teenagers and he's like
he's a what i mean what a couple people
getting killed by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal
three people got stabbed in 1978.
[ __ ] i gotta hide under my desk every
time there's a mass shooting at my
school he says he says a line like that
like where where it's in comparison like
three murders in 1978 with a butcher
knife and then today we deal with x y
and z like all these horrible things
like mass shootings and
[ __ ] terrorism and stabbings and all
sorts of crazy [ __ ] and the kids like we
live in a totally different world now
and that seems quaint yeah just shut the
[ __ ] up dave
shut up and uh it's fine i thought it
was a little too exaggerated but it's
fine that the lori strode is still like
obsessed and traumatic traumatized by it
that's the whole point of that first
movie is her dealing with her trauma how
it affects the rest of her family like
that's fine for that character right but
the fact that every single person in
this town expanded is the the simpsons
angry mob dakota simpsons again
principal seymour skinner there's no
justice like angry mob justice
yes it's like an episode of the simpsons
it is yeah it meets the titanic we'll
get into that
it's a mad mad mad world
in my opinion the whole world has gone
mad wacko the want destruction of
private property you're getting online
i'm not kidding about all i can take
i win we're gonna have to
it's now the only horror elements are
a handful of brutal murders yeah that
that are that's like for a horror movie
okay they didn't shy away from gore and
stabbings and whatnot but but if you're
trying to kind of catch i'm not scared
by the way that's the thing is it's not
scary it's just like blunt and brutal
and like mean-spirited which is which is
fine for a movie like this i like the
moment there's the elderly couple
david david gordon green does a stupid
thing in both these movies where he
introduces characters solely to get
killed off immediately
and it's like oh to make you care about
them they'll have some sort of quirk
and this does that the last movie did
that with like the the dad in the last
movie there's the dan the sun and the
truck and the sun was talking about
wanting to dance and then later there's
the cops in the car talking about
sandwiches for five minutes right in
this movie we have an older couple older
married couple that are playing with a
toy drone yes the lady has a toy drone
and it just goes on with her plane with
this drone and then they talk about
eating cheez-its and drinking wine and
then michael meyer shows up and kills
them right but the the mean-spiritedness
that i liked was he stabs her in the
throat with like a broken uh fluorescent
tube
and and she has to sit there still alive
she can't move just watching her husband
get knife after knife in his back and
michael myers is testing out which knife
is the best yes i thought that was the
best scene in the whole moments like
that work but that's that's all that
works in movie logic you have the lady
playing with the little tiny drone and
then you know i guess i would have
rolled my eyes at this too but later on
in the film someone has a bigger drone
with like a camera on it i know how to
fly that drone and
then they're like little flying it
around and it has a heat sensing mode
there's michael myers he's in the woods
he's heading towards you he's heading
towards you you know
she's flying the drone and that's like
what that's what they call setup and
payoff yeah and that's nothing like that
just played with a draw a little tiny
drone for no reason other than it's like
something to do it's a false setup to no
payoff which is fine to pull the rug out
from under you every now and then but i
was just like
okay
it didn't have an effect it didn't have
a purpose other than
to make you go oh okay i guess they died
we've talked about this to death but
halloween and other movies kind of
similar to it are a one movie thing that
only works once
because there is no
meat to it there's no
unless you go into schlock territory
see that's that's kind of which is why
some of the sequels as bad as they are
or more entertaining to watch than this
movie this movie's just kind of like
miserable
michael myers is just an unstoppable
force of evil that
has no remorse or plan or you know and
that's the the creepiness and the first
one
but like say if in this we would be like
well what do we do i don't know
like you said desperation they dredge up
like every possible character but you
know there are a lot of other people
yeah even though 40 years later
half of them would be dead half of them
would have moved to other cities and
states you know
not cared at all
i need to speak with sheriff brackett
well then you'll have to travel about
3000 miles south of here
what bracket retired back in 81.
move to st petersburg not sit around
this small town forever for 40 years
every halloween going
we're gonna pair our respects to the
three people that died 40 years ago like
no one's gonna do that yeah it's
unrealistic and then it makes it seem
like the events of halloween happened
like yesterday but um like if michael
myers left head and field he just
he's oh here's a come to i'm gonna
hitchhike and here comes the truck i
better take off my spooky mask then he
gets in the truck and then he drives and
goes to you know jason goes to manhattan
or whatever you know he goes to i don't
know
it goes to las vegas
has ever been a slasher movie set in las
vegas i don't think so there was
leprechaun went to vegas but that
doesn't count that's complete schlock
not a slasher movie yeah
there's really not much you can do with
that i guess
it's an interesting backdrop a complete
juxtaposition of of like
scary michael myers and
uh casino a casino
i don't know
that's a challenge right there that's a
challenge michael myers goes to vegas
what happens in vegas dies in vegas
throw some tag lines in there
jackpot
i was thinking he really needs like
one-liners at this point yeah he wants
to start talking because when he was
like smashing someone's head against the
car
i just kept picturing freddy saying some
kind of like silly
line here's your first course in
driver's ed
driver's head
driver's dead yeah yeah yeah
any hack writer could figure this out
uh michael myers no he's pure evil
evil for 40 years
every character talks like dr loomis
tell me
what the hell are we dealing with
evil
evil
dies
tonight they all constantly talk about
the evil we have to stop the like dr
loomis does that that's his thing but
now every character talks like him and
it sounds silly
donald pleasant kind of it sounds silly
from donald pleasance kind of but he
makes it work because he's a good actor
but he just having all these random
actors delivering those same type of
goofy lines
doesn't work for
no reason anthony michael hall's kind of
like the dr lupus
kind he's like the one who's leading the
charge yeah and he's it's just because
he was the kid at the house wasn't paul
rudd the kid at the house in halloween
six yeah
that's a race from this timeline though
that doesn't count oh okay that's all it
would have been great if they got paul
rudd bag then you get some humor in
there yeah yeah
ball rod get someone with a little bit
of uh charisma because anthony michael
hall sucks with this movie he's got one
note the whole movie he's just
constantly like angry and brooding
the only the only person that comes
across like a like a relatable likable
human being is judy greer
yeah she's the only one she's like
carrying this movie on her back
yeah and then the laurie strode
character is just sort of like
sits in the hospital useless
trailer lines for the entire thing
yeah
lazy and then has some kind of rekindled
romance with the cop yeah that i mean
it's a mess i i don't even know where to
start yeah in this like
it's one of those things where it's like
what do you do
i don't know how do you continue this
story
i i it it
it's a brand name
like iep thing
it's like a mcdonald's meal just like
you you you see it it's like oh i know
what that is yeah
i have another one
like there's no art artistry to it it's
just it's just [ __ ] awful which would
be fine if it was at least entertaining
i mean i love the friday the 13th
franchise those movies are all garbage
but they're super entertaining and this
movie takes itself so seriously
it's so like like by the end laurie
strode has this long monologue and it's
just so like up its own ass
legacy
that
it really has to do
with the nature of evil and so like
self-serious
and it does have
like the last movie kind of had a theme
of like trauma and
jamie lee curtis was comparing it to
like the me too movement and interviews
and stuff and then with this movie
this is the most embarrassing thing
uh this movie was shot like two and a
half years ago something like that
2018 or 2019 but now in interviews she's
saying talking about like the theme to
make it sound like a bigger more
important movie than it is uh she's
comparing the mob justice and this to
black lives matter protests it takes on
what happens when trauma infects an
entire community and we're seeing it
everywhere
with the
black lives matter movement we're seeing
it in action and halloween kills weirdly
enough dovetailed onto that
preceded it that seems like not only a
bad idea but kind of tasteless
and stupid i don't i don't quite get the
connection the mobs it's mob justice i
mean yeah
i guess we should go there like i
started to get like
political
fumes
i guess off it which i mean which is
fine as long as the movie is good
there's a time and place
for for political metaphors and stuff in
a halloween movie it's a franchise where
the the killer
shoves fluorescent tubes into people's
throats yeah not really yet yeah but but
it was like i don't know
uh
all that
there one there is one line where
someone's like the
the cops like you failed us like you you
you it has to be us up to us now the
sheriff's department no no no no no no
no sheriff we will not calm down we have
watched your department fail
fail tonight
this is haddenfield this is our town but
that gets muddled too because then when
lori strode is in the hospital room
coincidentally the cop kind of love
interest of her it gets put in the same
room as her
and he he talks about like you know i i
could have shot him 40 years ago i
should have shot him
and this is a cop talking about shooting
an unarmed man and laurie strode is like
agreeing with him
that kind of muddles your whole message
then doesn't it in terms of like what
they're trying to say and what the
message actually how it actually comes
across it's muddled yeah
it's like it wasn't thought out the
scene you're referencing is
michael myers is he has a he's choking
the other cop
he has like i don't know he's yeah he's
choking him yeah he's got him right in
front he doesn't have his knife
so michael myers doesn't even have a
weapon on him
and he's standing there with the gun
kind of like you know when you have a
hostage
and you have someone like a cop like
trying to kill the hostage taker
usually the hostage taker will have some
kind of weapon
that will inflict instant death or
damage to the person they're holding
like knife at the throat or gun to the
head right and michael myers says
neither so really all the cop could have
should have done is just walked right up
to michael myers
walked up to the side of him and put the
gun right to his [ __ ] forehead
because the choking takes a while to
kill your victim
you know
a minute so he had plenty of time to
walk up i mean and then you can argue
although the character was was frazzled
and didn't quite know what to do but but
then you have the people the one guys
like you you the cops you failed us you
you didn't do your job blah blah it's up
to the people now it's up to community
policing
and and then and then i started to think
like oh my god is this about trump
and then because
there's a there is a scene where like
they're with their yelling evil dies
tonight
and it's very reminiscent to usa
and um and then there's a mob
that's chasing uh some poor like uh
insane asylum guy another guy that
escaped
on the bus and the first one who escaped
and he's like confused and crazy and he
he doesn't know why all these people are
chasing him
and so like you have the angry mob
they're like breaking down the doors to
this hospital and going up staircases
and i'm like it's comical i'm like are
they trying to do a thing about like
what all the hillbillies stormed the
like is this about is this about
politics but this was made before that
which is i know and that and that's like
where i'm surprised when you said black
lives matter i'm surprised jamie curtis
didn't didn't swap her story out to say
this is a
you know anti-trump movie like this is
about like when maybe they'll do that
with the next one when a bunch of crazy
uh townsfolk uh will small townsfolk get
all riled up by uh by a like a guy who's
chanting yeah
they should have made michael myers mask
orange christ's sake instead of white um
but but uh and i'm like what are they
trying to say yeah mob
mob justice is is not
effective but i guess it's not because
at the end they they mob justice the
hell out of michael myers and he
survives it well the what is the message
and again i want to remind everybody it
was pre
black lives matter movement black lives
matter movement
black lives matter movement
black lives matter movement
that aspect of it the the part where
they start chasing the the other uh
crazy guy that's been let loose and he's
confused and doesn't know what happened
what's going on
that part is like where conceptually i
think there could have been an
interesting idea there but it's
completely flubbed in the execution
which is the idea of how
people can get so kind of blinded by
rage and getting worked up
it's like twitter that whole scene is
like like a metaphor for twitter yeah
where it's like we're all angry we're
all angry and it doesn't even matter if
they're aiming their anger in the right
direction then it pushes someone to kill
themselves and then it pushes that guy
to kill himself and that's when just to
make sure we understand what's happening
elderly confused sheriff brackett goes
he's turning us into monsters like yep
we got that
now he's turning us into monsters
we got that by the angry mob running up
the stairs and pushing a guy to commit
suicide
we don't need you to literally say it
now he's turning us into monsters
ugh
this movie's so stupid it's a
masterpiece
is
incredibly stupid
it's like it's like i don't know
a masterpiece
but
you have a horror villain who's not
scary who has seemingly no purpose
whatsoever
which is scary in itself if done
correctly but then you add all those
other layers on top of it of of like all
these interpersonal relationships tons
of characters so many characters too
many characters and that's the other
thing too like with that line the he's
turning us into monsters and so much
half of the movie is like exposition and
trying to catch you up on
not just stuff that happened in the
original movie but stuff that happened
in the 2018 movie which is like the last
one we know it just happened
i forgot it all
but then there's like and if that wasn't
enough then we have to make
1978 recreation flashback scenes to set
up the backstory for more characters
because we need more characters in this
movie and we brought back all of those
people so kyle richards
who played
you know the little girl lindsay
came back we have the character of tommy
where there are other characters that's
just like exhausting that stuff was kind
of fun like technically it was it was
really well done after michael myers
escaped like what happened like he had
to walk down an alley and
but again it undermines the first movie
the ending of the first movie is so
brilliant and so perfect wonder mine's
the first movie but where have you been
the last 40 years jay 40 years ago 40
years ago
but if we're if this is a clean slate if
we're ignoring all the sequels and this
is a refresh which is the whole idea
um to then go back and be like oh here
he is
you know after the end of the first
movie his body wasn't there that's the
whole scary thing is like michael myers
he's still out there he could be
anywhere and it's like oh he just wanted
to go home why did michael myers go to
laurie strode's cabin
in the last movie it was like a
convoluted series of events where it was
the evil doctor
i complained about this with that movie
too because he has no reason to go after
her so it's like the doctor pushed him
in that direction which they even
mentioned that in this movie where the
other cop is like no lori it's not about
you he's not after you
um which is true that's the case so it
was like a it was like a twist yeah kind
of like a twist okay okay well that
twist just dug them into a hole yeah
wrote them into a hole
yeah because i'm thinking like yeah this
is this is the time of the show where we
say what would we do what do you do the
the the reality bending of all these
random
characters from the first one all
hanging out friends going out on
halloween night and drinking a
96 year old nurse
who once got her car stolen by michael
myers who would probably either be dead
or live living on a different
city and also had no connection to
haddenfield she was like a nurse at the
smith grove cemetery
which is
whatever why not move to the town where
you there the murders took place where
the guy who stole your car
murdered people that's what i would do
but but but you you take that
you get rid of all that get rid of all
these people yes right where there are
other characters and you have lori
strode end up in the hospital
on halloween night michael myers uh how
about a big storm rolls in
you start with credits you have a nice
little simple credit sequence
oh they had flaming pumpkins in the
beginning of this right yeah you have
pumpkins with candles on all the door
steps right
storm rolls into town
this is good
thunderclaps
kids are out trick-or-treating parents
are walking around
starts to rain instead of flaming
pumpkins we have the rain extinguishing
candles and pumpkins on porches all
around haddonfield
rain has ruined halloween
rain has also extinguished the fire at
lori strode's cabin
michael myers hand busts out of the
debris
he's free
lori strode gets taken to the hospital
they do she's laying there recuperating
the storm's coming into town and we have
a nice simple movie
where our characters are in everyone
goes in their houses and locks the doors
maybe a couple murders along the way
michael says [ __ ]
you locked me in your cellar and lit the
house on fire i now have motivation
to come and find you and your stupid
daughters granddaughters or daughters or
whoever they are yeah and you
locked me in the basement and let the
house on fire that's my motivation done
i'm gonna find you you're probably at
the hospital because i stabbed you in
the belly
i'm gonna make my way to the hospital
through this rainstorm the whole movie
is raining
michael myers in the rain outside your
window yeah it's crazy yeah never seen
that bus
bust in i got to get a new butcher knife
a couple scenes makes its way eventually
hospital power it's a little sketchy
starts to go out
hospital
skeletons skeleton staff at the hospital
and barely anybody's there
nice and spooky when was the last time
you watched halloween too
i i it's been a very long that's
basically what you're describing aside
from the rainstorm
he makes his way to the hospital there's
a limited staff
well that's a spooky movie exactly like
i for all the problems like i don't like
the sister twists
but halloween two is a perfectly
effective atmospheric little movie but
like it doesn't have 9 000 characters i
don't know what all the memphis and
political subtext right that's the crazy
part that's the that's the off-putting
stuff is the the the madness um with a
hospital you can do
by the time you get to the hospital like
that's your third act you do you have
all sorts of great set pieces in a
hospital like you have elevators you
kill people in elevators you have
the more with the frozen bodies and
you have also you have doctor equipment
and saws and
drugs and you know
like michael myers inject somebody with
like [ __ ] morphine or something
they're like oh [ __ ] and they're trying
to like fall down the hallway
you need those scenes
we didn't have this one shot where
michael myers is just like
slowly walking towards it's like it's
just like brutal and quick
there's nothing creepier than when
laurie strode looks out her window and
sees him standing by the laundry yeah
that lack of movement
thank you lack of movement
he's a ghost he's he's the boogeyman
he's not i mean yes he's strong and and
he kills people brutally but especially
for a 60 year old man they've turned
kind of turned him into jason
and and it's all wrong and yes there
might be comparisons to halloween too
but hey if you're rebooting
just take take halloween two the premise
and just do it a little better and have
four or five set pieces in the hospital
and end it on the roof of the hospital
where he pushes her off or he she pushes
him off don't do the gas explosion again
yeah uh you know do something a little
different but but
get rid of all these [ __ ] characters
i think that's what they they were
worried about it being too like just
simple generic slasher so they thought
this would be a way to make it feel
different and fresh oh my god oh simple
generic
scary is the essence of the first
halloween movie oh i understand it's a
mad mad mad mad world
it's not
or
i was joking
we watched this together
um and i was i was like joking making
comparisons to the titanic because it it
felt like
the the titanic starts to sink right
and
jack is is handcuffed to the pipe in in
like the the
the cops office or something right
there's water coming in and rose rescues
them and they come up on deck right
and and it's still at that point where
it's like people don't really know what
to do yeah they're some people are like
oh it's a great night
then some people are running and
knocking people over and it's a little
bit
chaotic
uh but not really and then it just
things just get worse and worse and
worse as the ship starts going down and
people start realizing there aren't
enough lifeboats and then people are
like falling down the stairs and pushing
each other and and that's what the
hospital scene looked like and i just
kept saying like are there enough
lifeboats i just felt like i was
watching
like a not a horror movie
i was watching like and then everyone's
just like running around the town and
getting the cars and
that's what reminded me of it's a mad
mad
bad world we got to stop michael myers
somehow
come on everybody mob justice
whoever gets the michael myers first
wins the gold
i'm like this is not a horror movie this
is a farce this is this is
i don't know what this is
sometimes people forget that what goes
up must come down
all of which proves very little except
they're not
now he's turning us into monsters
i wrote down sean of the dead i don't
know why maybe the bar the bar all the
people running out of the bar i thought
they were going to hole up in the bar
they do have uh in shot of the dead
they're at the bar and they set up the
the the gun that's above the bar yeah
and here oh it's a baseball bat here we
have a baseball bat some random guy he's
talking about how it was his dad's now
it says old huckleberry or something
hickory whatever it's called
and then it's like oh and then like
anthony michael hall just takes the bat
and that's it
old hickory
old huckleberry i think it's old hickory
i don't i think
not huckleberry
you know it's a made of wood hickory is
a kind of i understand that but it's not
called old hickory in the movie yes it
is i'm almost positive
you're gonna try and look up the name of
the baseball no no no no no um
old hickory is a reference to something
it's like the name of a nickname of a
president
hold on yep andrew jackson
jackson's toughness and determination
reminded his troops of a firmly rooted
hickory tree earned him the name old
hickory
so yes it's not huckleberry i remember
having a weird name you [ __ ] up
anyways speaking of weird names
oh yes
oh well
uh we'll talk about that now okay our
favorite actor in this film is bob
odenkirk
uh
in the original film
uh pj souls
and a character named bob
they're they're having little sexual
times
and bob goes up to get a glass of water
or something and michael myers kills him
and michael myers returns with a ghost
sheet over his head and bob's glasses
over the ghost sheet one of the
creepiest images in all of horror films
uh and and
we cut to a there's a photo of pj souls
somewhere like a victim photo they're
it's when they're at the bar and the
news is coming out that these killings
are happening and they're like this is
similar to the killings from 1978 so
they show a photo pj souls they show a
photo of bob
but it's a photo of young bob odenkirk i
guess he's credited in the film as bob
odenkirk
i looked it up and i guess that is him
okay i don't know if they couldn't track
down the guy that played bob in the
original movie so they just threw that
in as an inside joker
considering that the
danny mcbride comedy comedy people must
be that yeah
i wanted to talk about zesty popcorn
uh the sub of the set design in this
okay uh
is bizarre
like like a a horror film should be very
like
atmospheric
visually stripped down you know
i mean it depends on what kind of horror
movie you're making but
uh the bar had a popcorn machine
words oh yeah remember the last best of
the worst with sandwiches
when the cop is talking about armed
robbery and right over his shoulder it
says sandwiches oh yeah and then we made
a joke i'm thinking about sandwiches
this whole time it's distracting excuse
me i'm going to get one of those
sandwiches
i've been thinking about these
sandwiches
the zesty popcorn is in the same bit
where you see bubbo and kirk on the tv
it's like it's like uh dolly
that's why zesty popcorn and then and
then uh
uh the
uh what's her face uh
judy greer is talking to a doctor or her
daughter at the hospital and they go
into like some kind of room
and there's a poster that's like
something about glaucoma is on the wall
and
like
hospitals and movies should be like
fairly simple and and stripped down oh
they go and then then there's another
scene where they go
into yeah it's like an exam room where
it says glaucoma and it's like glaucoma
i think it's what she's talking to like
the town uh mayor or something the guy
in the cowboy hat then there's a
different scene where they go into like
the little kids room a place where you
put kids to play yes right
and and i think this this is obviously
intentional on the wall there's a creepy
bunny
and it has sort of like a white michael
myers-esque face and it's holding a
carrot
that is very much shaped like a big
butcher knife
and it was like
thematically like i get what they're
doing they're trying to have like but it
just doesn't work
that those kind of like that kind of set
design doesn't work in a michael myers
movie it needs to look a hundred percent
there can't be any kind of like
cartoonish
uh
this asides or visuals or we can't see
zesty popcorn
can never see those words in the
halloween picture
or little tiny toy drones or all that
stuff rips you out of the ultimate
intent of the movie which is
a man the shape who is just a relentless
relentless killer and who will stop at
nothing to get you and bust through the
closet door and look around and then go
like this
when it's confused
[ __ ] scary [ __ ] from the first one
all those visuals john carpenter
man rest in peace
he knew exactly what the [ __ ] he was
doing with that
don't know i just know it like there are
so many like small odd choices uh and
and then the script was just like this
big like someone threw a bomb on it
and it exploded and they rearranged all
the pages from 25 other scripts and
shoved it all together and hoped it
worked it's totally [ __ ] baffling how
you could screw up
a michael myers movie i mean i know they
have in the past but
trick-or-treat
[ __ ] like you have a fresh start
the last one was pretty good
it's the
keep it simple stupid
kiss that's the yeah i mean
the a24 movies i know those are a little
more kind of artsy but just that slow
pace that ominous atmosphere
like that's what that's all you need for
a halloween movie yep yep yep
yeah it's about atmosphere it's about
uh
it's not so much about the kills but
about the the fear
the dread the anticipation that's why i
don't never really think of the original
movie as a slasher movie
i know it's like it kind of what started
the slasher trend but that movie itself
is more about yeah the lead-up to right
you know discovering a body falling out
of a closet or looking across the street
and there's someone just staring at you
it's so simple right yes that's that's
the best way to
to surmise all this k-i-s-s
and this was the opposite of that
so would you recommend following kills
oh god no
for a franchise that's known for having
lots of terrible sequels this might be
one of the worst
yeah which is really amazing
right a modern movie is worse than like
halloween five
we both know he's alive
but you know where he is
michael
halloween is halloween five the one that
ends with the mask landing on the ground
that's halloween six yeah that one was
pretty bad too most of them were pretty
bad i wonder if you go back and watch
five and six if you're just like these
are brilliant after they're watching
this trick i mean they're at least
simpler and more in spirits of
the original movie than this one is this
is one of those things where it's like i
i wouldn't even recommend it even if
it's free
i mean i i
signed up to peacock
so i could watch uh
the [ __ ] [ __ ] office and uh
ap bio the continuation of ap bio and
i'm like
and i saw halloween kills is on there
it's free
even if you have peacock don't launch it
don't bother don't waste your time it'll
frustrate you more than anything it's
not scary
and it ends with kind of a cliffhanger a
lead into the next movie i don't give a
single [ __ ] what happens in the next one
after those
no no
no this stuff is so tired yeah
especially not just like with this movie
but it does that thing that like i don't
know jurassic world and all these movies
do is where there's
the
the characters in the movie and the
movie itself has such a like
reverence for every single little minute
thing from the original movie where it's
annoying and it's like just i don't know
it's like uh i'm just waiting
for that new ghostbusters movie and how
every little thing from the original
movie which is an irreverent comedy
they're gonna treat with this like
glowing nostalgia and it's all super
important and meaningful it's like no
it's just a bunch of goofy crap
that's all it has to be
econ had a dream
he had a mission yeah
but my prediction that ghostbusters
movie there's going to be a cgi ghost
egon in it and it's going to be the most
embarrassing thing ever
it's going to happen
will it be
it won't be funny it'll be no it'll be
an emotional heart string yeah yeah
that's exactly what it's going to be
it'll be like a like a like a bad cgi
harold remus because the whole family in
that movie is like his
daughter and granddaughter or whatever
so yeah they're gonna have a moment to
say goodbye to ego you have the power
within you to build your own proton pack
i don't know how great grandpa
i don't know how
you you can do it
you're a spangler i'd be like the new
skywalker
but i do not do it grandpa
i can do it
scene where they test the little girl
tests out the proton pack in an alleyway
behind a chinese restaurant
and she flies up in the air and
farts hey at least that movie was trying
to just be a comedy it's terrible
but i see the trailers for this new one
and it's like oh we're doing a wistful
nostal it's like things are
they're trying to make you like
nostalgic for things that
weren't ever like emotional in the first
place
yeah you watch ghostbusters and
you know bill murray has no idea what's
going on he doesn't give a [ __ ] he's
just saying random things yeah he's high
on cocaine and he's just saying random
things and he has no idea what movie
they're making and that's that's a lot
of the charm yeah and and yeah but let's
not judge the new ghostbusters movie
before it comes out jail okay i'm basing
it on the trailer and my prediction that
there will be a cgi egon okay but but
not just that but like they go to the
myers house and that recreated 70 stuff
and because is that mentioned in the
original movie that there's like a dead
dog on the ground out of frame and
donald pleasance is like he got hungry
he got hungry
and so in this movie there's a wide shot
he's like there's a dead dog it's like
we got to see the dead dog
we go upstairs we got to see the the
window that got smashed by the gutter
that that slammed into it in a jump
scare in the original movie just like
all the that stuff where it's like none
of that matters they can't it's not what
makes a movie they can't take that bold
step forward into new territory yeah you
have to just like wallow in nostalgia
michael myers needs to get
into the cab of a truck and head to las
vegas
that's that's uh that's where the
franchise needs to go
oh he needs to storm the capitol with a
bunch of trump supporters
so if anyone ever storms the capitol
again someone just wear a michael myers
costume while you do it just just for
the fun of it
what a great visual
why not [ __ ] everything
