well that seems reasonable
does this mean i can finally watch my night court tape
better than that mr plinkett you can
stream any episode of knight quote
whatever you want
no vcr needed you know i waited almost a
decade for those two clowns to fix my
vcr
and now you come along magically and
just pimp out all my [ __ ] for me
huh you know i think those two
guys were conning me yeah it's a shame
what happened to mike and jay
murdered in their own shop
why i haven't heard that somebody spiked
their drinks with
hallucinogenics oh i wonder who would
have done that
but when lightning speed vcr repair
heard about lightning fast
uh yeah yeah sure whatever when we heard
about how long it took you to get your
vcr repaired
why we just knew we had to jump in
and help yous however we could
god bless you sir now there's
just the matter of the bill oh
let's see here you factor in
the tv the cost of speakers
carry the one and of course
labor your total comes out to be
597 642 dollars and
11 cents oh she was
that's nearly all of the cash that i've
been saving for the last 100 years
but that sounds reasonable i guess
i'll start counting it out right now
anything for night court
yes yes anything
anything for night court for all those
suitcases filled with
the cash ten thousand
twenty thousand thirty thousand
hey don't you know the rebooting night
court uh
never mind sixty
thousand seventy thousand
hold it right there oh my god
it's us mike and
okay mike and jay
but i thought you were dead well we were
or rather our clones were
you stupid [ __ ] do you think we're
dumb enough to go outside and work
during a pandemic
we've been holed up in mr plinkett's
basement this whole time
you see when china released the
coronavirus their big plan
was to sell dumb americans clones of
themselves to go out and work
that way if your clone caught coveted
and died you'd still be alive
they didn't advertise it very well
though i think the only people to buy
clones were us
and herman cain yeah that explains all
those tweets he made after he died
you see we've known for years that mr
plinkett had over a half a million
dollars
hidden somewhere in his house yeah we
just didn't know where
but then when we saw you snooping around
the vcr repair shop
we told our clones to play along you
led us right to it
i've been searching for those four
suitcases for over a decade now 120
530 540
000 thank you whatever your name is
wow jay what do you know a crazy scheme
of mine
actually worked ah but it didn't
you [ __ ] you see right now
as we speak mr plinkett is counting on
all of his cash
and he's gonna give it to me that's
right
me [ __ ] so in the end
you didn't really
so long 2020.
why am i counting i don't remember
anything that just happened
who are you guys are you here to help me
watch night court
oh you know mr blanket we would if we
could
but sadly night court isn't streaming on
any of the 143 million apps you have
yeah so you'll have to watch the old
episodes you recorded on your vhs tape
and for that we're gonna have to
fix your vcr
oh how much is that gonna cost
is this enough money
ah we're back baby we're back
hey mike since it's christmas do you
want to watch wonder woman 1984
hey why not but does it matter that i
haven't seen the first 1983 films
whatever it's just a superhero movie
ah finally with first run movies
streaming directly to a nice home
theater system
we can avoid the horrible horrible
nightmare that is
the movie theater experience amen
brother yeah oh
someday starting okay
hello what
my my car warranty is about to expire
do you want a beer do you want to do you
want a beer no
sir my car expired five years ago
it going to cost me how much looking
back
well sure hold on i gotta i have to eat
these potato chips while i
talk
doctor said i gotta keep eating at
certain times
wonder woman 1984 is the latest entry in
the dc
cinematic universe or maybe it's not
maybe it's just a sequel to wonder woman
that ignores all that other stuff
the joker movie's not a part of the dc
universe is it
because that has joaquim phoenix and not
jared leto
do any of these movies fit together does
this movie fit together
too many story lines to keep track of
cgi cat lady
the mandalorian overacting wonder woman
losing her powers
except for when she needs to use them
and then i guess she has them again
magical wishing rocks 1980s trying on
clothes montages
aerobics ghost rape this movie's got
everything
oh i kind of caught it
oh it's spilled all over me
you just don't got it jay
what's it jeanna sequoia does wonder
woman 1984
have it have we said this before but
this movie was the cinematic equivalent
of the bluesmobile
i think we've used that analogy a few
times over the years okay
i know what you're talking about this is
the best superhero movie since
spider-man 3.
oh oh yeah yeah i did think of
spider-man 3 a lot that's the movie it
reminded me the most of
yeah where it's like all over the place
in terms of like hey that's pretty good
hey that's terrible hey that's laughably
bad and i'm actually enjoying how stupid
it is
oh but now it's really [ __ ] boring
why is there 15
plot lines uh shoehorned in villains
it's it's it's just like spider-man 3.
yeah well it uh the kristen wiig
character was
similar to the
um for grace kai was kind of jealous of
peter parker and so he became like evil
from
the uh the venom slime and you can ah
it's also the jim carrey and batman
forever it's electro
and amazing spider-man too the villains
and comic books are often
envious of the superhero but we're going
to talk about wonder woman
1984 today um and i don't know if you
want to preface
it with the reason why we're talking
about it is a special movie
uh it signifies the end of tentpole
blockbusters
in more ways than one maybe yes because
the kind of movie that this is checks
all those boxes
of the miserable overbloated
big budget popcorn big 1 trillion dollar
money-making nightmare they're watching
money burn on screen yeah that certain
movies have become
compared to uh other quality tv
and or movies that are that are
infinitely better i'm like this is i'm
watching him like this is so bad
it's junk there were some
good parts or good things um it's one of
those
when you throw that much [ __ ] into the
movie some of it's bound to stick that's
the thing
this feels like like one of the death
throes of that
kind of movie and that kind of movie
going experience which is sad in a way
because some of these movies can be good
but yeah it's funny because we always
everybody always compares you know dc to
marvel
and the marvel movies are always
consistently good
average to good uh but they all have
kind of a sameness to it
to them and then you look at the dc
movies and it's like
every different direction you have a
movie like this or you have a movie like
the joker which
you know i didn't personally connect
with but a lot of people liked that
movie because it was so
like serious and dramatic uh and that
was a you know
quality joaquin phoenix performance and
then you have shazam which is like a
kitty cartoon movie it's just like every
possible thing there's nothing to
connect
any of these movies i don't know i don't
know what the dc
what their goal is with these movies
just try a bunch of different [ __ ]
i don't know i don't i don't think they
have a road map necessarily like
marvel did like kevin feige laid out
yeah
from the very beginning well they
started one in the very beginning it was
zack snyder was in charge of all this
[ __ ] yeah and that went off the rails
almost immediately
yeah and now it's just like a
free-for-all
it's been very surreal
patty jenkins you directed one of the
only good dc movies
you only directed it you didn't write it
you want to write the second one
i had to look that up because i saw that
in the credits i was like did she write
the first one and she didn't
uh but she also wrote and directed
monster which is a very good movie
so it's like okay she can write a good
movie
it doesn't mean she could write a
superhero that's that's true it's a very
very different type of movie
monster is based on a true story
yeah and it's very character driven
story existed already
patty jenkins wrote the script and then
you know there's some other
people attached to screenwriters and i
looked this up too because i just i
i didn't look it up because i was
wondering if she wrote the first one i
just looked it up because it was so bad
i'm like who wrote this [ __ ] um and then
there's some couple guys like attached
to other
dc projects jeff johns is one i know
he's a dc guy
but you could tell patty jenkins created
the story
which is interesting because the first
movie everyone was was touting the you
know female lead action movie it's a
feminist superhero movie which is fine
you get to this movie though and
the entire movie hinges on her longing
for
a man her dead boyfriend that she knew
for a month
it's 80 years later or whatever she's
still obsessed with this man
and then uh there's like a cat fight but
literal cat fight between these two
ladies it feels
like like 10 steps back from the first
movie yeah i saw
a couple comments about that where it's
like wonder woman wonder woman can't
survive
uh without a man in her life and
and i was like oh you know i roll like
okay
they're going to do a love story thing
what's the problem and i watched it and
he watched it and they were kind of
right
excuse me are you waiting for someone no
just me
like she didn't find any other
man to love like because he said why
don't you date another guy
there's plenty of guys out there not you
know is it how do you how do you
perceive it as as a longing
you know love that spans across oceans
of time or
that she's just like ah like a blank
slate like pathetic
nobody that's how she comes across and
that's and that's like
i don't know i was just thinking about
that it's like like a character like
batman
can carry a movie without a love
interest you know
i guess he has a little uh batman has
like uh
he's kind of tortured himself you know
um
he's he's got two personas and um
uh wonder woman is just like
she stops guys at a mall and then then
she goes
back to work yeah like like there's
literally nothing there
yes to work with yeah until you bring in
chris pine to save the day
i don't know
yeah that's the weird thing too about
the opening like they have the flashback
to her on
mascara or whatever the [ __ ] her planet
is her world
i don't know and uh that whole opening
is completely pointless it has nothing
to do with that that was the worst
um it looks terrible it's like that was
the imax sequence
the jungle gym of death that they're
running across yeah for some reason
american ninja warrior
yeah they let this little girl compete
and the whole it goes on forever
and it just keeps going and then you get
to the end and it's like the lesson is
uh you you have to you can't
you can't yeah you can't uh look for an
easy fix
or a cheap way to you know you can't
cheat your way out of a bigger problem
which i guess kind of ties in but that's
also
something that an eight-year-old
an adult definitely knows we don't need
that 15-minute opening scene to teach us
that
the the little moral lesson of um you
can't
you can't find a shortcut but some but
you can
sometimes sometimes the shortcut is
really valuable i i don't know
and i guess that that goes with the plot
of uh
max powers pedro pascal maxwell
max powers mex power is that his name
it's max something is it max power's
homer simpson's
alias that is that is max max gold
you start with that opening we have a
the opening i think is like 18 minutes
long
i mean it's like literally the first act
of a regular movie
i mean it could be five minutes long if
that's the point is
she cheats at a race but it just keeps
going did they just start saying like
empty platitudes that's the whole movie
like
her speech at the end is more of that
[ __ ] yeah i i couldn't even hear what
you were saying and i
i i wasn't even paying attention at that
point
um but in the beginning yeah the
platitudes are just
i was just laughing i'm just like oh my
god
i'm gonna i'm gonna write them up on the
screen now
that is the only truth and truth is all
there is
you cannot be the winner because you are
not ready to win
and there is no shame in that only in
knowing the truth in your heart
and not accepting it no true hero is
born
from lies like
patience diligence
the courage to face the truth one day
you will become all that you dream of
and more
and everything will be different uh
okay so after that opening sequence
which was overly long because then we
have another
scene right after that that feels like
the opening of a movie with the whole
mall heist
that's the better way to introduce
wonder woman yeah is um
is a is a classic uh wonder woman saves
the day
situation and it's a super corny scene
which i was okay with i liked that scene
that's the thing is that was like like
sam raimi spider-man yeah
schmaltzy uh corny garbage and i loved
it it reminded me of
uh the richard donner superman
movies you know where it's just like um
kind of goofy and the dc stuff is not
really known for that
but and also too uh
patty jenkins shoots on film yeah i was
surprised to read that
this was film yeah it was 35 millimeter
and then 75 70 millimeter for the imax
and so it had that
like legit like grainy real grainy film
look like it was from the 80s almost
like it was like a real movie
like it wasn't super clean and digital
you know i know you can add film grain
to give it a movie look but
it looked like real like film and so it
kind of
legitimately felt like throwback and so
aside from some of the effects well the
effects in the beginning were a little
a little not great
i i don't really care about effects
anymore i really just if something looks
bad like cgi wise i just don't care
i just don't well that's then it's like
an hour before wonder woman show i mean
we see diana prince of course but before
there's any sort of like wonder woman
action
yeah i think it is over an hour before
any i think the next scene is that egypt
action scene the car chase scene oh yes
yes that's the next big action scene so
where did this movie go
wrong can we can we add up well one i
didn't understand anything that happened
wishes mike this is the weirdest sequel
to wish master i've ever seen
i wish this movie was never made and
i've seen wish master
iv somebody said let's let's make the
movie take place in 1984
yeah that is the title of 84. i forgot
the title
i didn't know it was 84.87 it really
doesn't matter they hardly
do anything with the 80 80s aspect of it
well
well other than the you mean like as far
as like like they don't play up the
nostalgia factor too much
it's like the mall at the beginning are
you [ __ ] kidding me
no there's not a lot there's like no pop
songs in the movie there's no
aside from the mall at the beginning we
see like an arcade there's almost no
80s stuff did we watch the same movie i
i'm just saying like
i mean a couple fashion things here and
there very little of the movie has
anything to do with the fact that it
takes place in 1984.
aside from some very superficial uh on
the the edges of the frame stuff uh
who are you i'm thinking of like
stranger things where it's like 80s
80s in your face oh my god that's what
this was jay
i didn't get that vibe at all maybe i
was just distracted by all the nonsense
maybe you were just following the
the amazing story i was trying to follow
the plot um
which is classic sequel we need to
put more villains in it i found this
beer cold
what why isn't this beer cold because
it's been sitting out here for the last
no it was in the fridge
i put it in the fridge when i got it
that's why it's not cold
do you quit
did i have to finish this myself they
did a good job of building her up in the
first movie
as far as like feeling like a real hero
that was that was the thing that stuck
like i don't remember that movie very
well i only saw that one time in the
theater
and i thought it was fun i thought it
was pretty good this movie was pretty
good um
and it really it felt like she is a hero
she was a fish out of water
she got used to her environment she
learned things from humans
she learned the world wasn't so black
and white there was like an art to her
character and then this there's
nothing they have nothing nothing to do
with her and it also contradicts
i don't know how much this matters but
when you get to like
i think it's in batman v superman or
justice league they say that
she's basically been in hiding since the
events of the first wonder woman movie
since world war one like no one knows
where she is
she's been in hiding and in this movie
she's
in the mall in her wonder woman costume
she's working
in the public with just still her same
name like you think she'd at least have
an alias
yeah so people don't catch on
so i don't know does any of this [ __ ]
matter does continuity matter in these
movies i did see an article that said
that warner brothers wanted to cut one
of the because there's two openings back
to back
there's what we talked about the
olympics thing and then there's the mall
scene
and warner brothers wanted her to cut
one of the two and she said no
so she has enough power where she could
tell warner brothers to [ __ ] off
i'm gonna make my movie as
self-indulgent as possible she
apparently
doesn't know how to write a story for a
character
for a strong character and i'm using
this
because people use it as a crutch or a
defense
with this movie is that you don't like
this movie because you don't like
strong female characters no we don't
like bad movies
i love a movie with a strong female
character this movie
does not have one no wonder woman is
is a flat line in this and you could
have done so much more
with that gap of time between wonder
woman one and this one
where like you said she's just i'm still
doing my thing
writing things like she could have gone
off the wagon she could have gone full
like luke skywalker on the island
you know she's going crazy from all this
time passing
something interesting and then she has
she has to like
find her strength again or you know i
don't know what the hell you do with the
wonder woman character all i know is
they did nothing with her character then
the movie started
and i guess while she's working at the
smithsonian she goes around stopping
petty crimes
somehow i don't know how she's always
there
because she's a superhero wow
this is incredible
that's why i i mean i think batman is
the best like dc
superhero because he's like grounded in
reality
you know what i mean and i like the fact
there's more to work with like
psychologically
and you know he works with the cops so
that like
they have the bat signal he knows where
crime is
he has technology that answers those
questions he's just a regular man but he
has a lot of technology
yeah so that makes his character
interesting and that's why his arch
nemesis the joker is interesting because
he's
he's the he's the polar opposite he's
the antithesis of batman
batman is law and order and justice and
the joker is
anarchy and chaos well that's why
kristen wiig's character is so
interesting in this movie because she's
jealous of wonder woman's shoes
such strong female characters
so fatty jenkins said i want to make a
movie about
how the 80s were bad and trump
as much as you say it like i didn't even
i didn't read a single [ __ ] thing
about this movie
well visually he looks like trump
there's first of all you start off like
what what do you think of when you think
of the 80s right obviously you think of
the fashion
you think of big shoulder pads on women
you think of the terrible music
you think a rubik's cube you think of
ronald reagan
um cold war reagan's got his finger on
the button the nukes
that all comes up later on the soviet
union
um and then that was the like
the era of trump's rise to
power or stardom the yuppie businessman
the yuppie that classic type
archetype yes the the um uh
gordon geckos right the the white guys
with the red suspenders in
in wall street making money donald trump
had his book
what's his famous book uh what's that
called
donald trump has this famous book i
don't know what it's called
i don't know i could see it in my head
you know yeah i see that he's
leaning against the yeah yeah and so it
was it's
and then this uh the pedro pascal
character
very much so looks like him i'm not a
loser
he's a loser it's a word donald trump
isn't usually at a loss for we have
losers
he's called fellow republican karl rove
a loser
a proven loser and a total loser
visually he looks like him i i guess i
wasn't thinking of trump so much outside
of the visual just because
he feels like that stock 80s character
right more so than specifically trump
why are you doing that don't you have
enough
why not why not wish for more
but they don't know what you're taking
from them we want what we want
the plot of the movie is there's a magic
stone that grants wishes and you touch
the magic stone of grant's wishes
and his wish is to be the magic stone he
basically wished for more wishes
the the genie paradox right which is
what everybody says i'd wish for more
unlimited wishes right and you can't do
that why not
that's the rules i guess the rules
but he gets around it by wishing that he
was the the personification of
the magic wish rock yeah uh and i guess
he needs
other people to make wishes to fuel his
power
something this is when it turns to
gobbledygook
i didn't understand anything at first i
thought okay he's just going to wish
that all of his bat all the bad land
that he bought
has oil deposits on it that's what i
thought he was going to wish for
that's not exciting enough your comic
movie and he's going to become like
super wealthy really fast and maybe like
then go bonkers and build a
missile that's going to blow up the moon
and wonder woman has to lasso the
missile
yeah nice and simple nice nice and uh
christopher reeve
christopher is that the superman iv
where he collects all the nukes
and throws them into the sun and creates
nuclear man
there's a lot of kristen wiig early on
like to the point where you think she's
going to be a more important role but
then she ultimately just ends up being
the uh
the heavy for the main bad guy yeah
which is weird it'd be like if uh
i don't know in raiders of the lost ark
the heavy the big
muscle guy that he fights if we had to
spend like 30 minutes setting up his
backstory
right when he's ultimately pointless
well the the cheetah or
leopard or whatever yeah yeah that
character i guess is the
official arch nemesis of wonder woman in
the comic books
and they really did her justice a
five-second fight scene that's terrible
yeah like she's like kind of like like
the
uh venom the spider-man like the the
opposite of wonder woman where she's you
know filled with jealousy or
emotional turmoil or something and
wonder woman is more
grounded and peaceful in her brain and
they have to [ __ ] slap each other well
the early stuff with her made
sense it ultimately ends up being
pointless but it's like she wishes
she idolizes uh diana prince she's like
i want to be just like her
beautiful and elegant and smart but when
you make a wish it's the monkey's paw
where then something bad
happens or something gets taken away
from you and she starts out as a nice
person but as she
becomes hot and cool she starts to
become a horrible person
and then she decides she wants to be a
cheetah
yeah she says i want to be an apex
predator
i mean why does she want to become a
cheetah
i'm assuming this isn't the backstory to
the character in the comments she liked
her
in the beginning she says i like the
animal print she goes rare
that's why jay that's why that's amazing
great writing
i mean to give the movie uh it's
credit that these are based on silly
characters from a comic book
sure you gotta have something i have 48
you know
uh i would have been fine if chris if
you're if you're gonna focus on kristen
wiig which you could cut her out of the
movie it wouldn't make any
difference and and then you'd have a
tighter movie that's just about
pedro pascal he's your villain uh but
they're like we got to put another
villain in we got to put cheetah in
i would be fine one or the other if
kristin wiggles the main villain
but then i guess she has to turn in
cheetah because that's the villain but
her just becoming like more angry as the
movie went along
like that kind of worked on its own
isolated from everything else they
didn't learn their lesson from
venom and sandman yeah in spider-man 3.
didn't sam rainey like famously say i
don't want to have two villains he
didn't want venom in the movie but the
studio forced him to put venom in there
but yeah kristen wiig very beginning
oh she's she drops her briefcase
everything falls out everything falls
out thus i thought i was watching
ghostbusters for me i know
it's like the exact same performance yes
and i like kristen awake for the most
part
the same character no kristen rig wig is
good in
anything but these kind of big big
blockbuster movies
yeah she meets diana prince and
i think she's lesbian for her because
she immediately asked her out to dinner
animal printer do you want to get lunch
i um i'm not now obviously it's morning
but later
today or whenever like around like a
lunch time well yeah it's it's set up
almost like yeah she
she is in love with diana prince right
it turns out she's just
jealous of her which again go back to
the feminism
all these women jealous of each other
can't fight him yeah
and they should have um like if they're
gonna do the jealousy thing
yeah that could have been a whole movie
in itself if you just remove
uh max powers yeah one or the other yeah
both of those story lines could have
been a movie
yeah yeah max powers you tone that down
because when they go to egypt and he's
like i'll
i'll give you a giant wall that
tears egypt into and does something and
deprives these people of water and you
give me all of your oil ha ha
i already gave my oil to saudi arabia
well i'm going to take
your security guards and your tanks and
then go over to saudi
i don't know what's happening like get
that out of there well i also love
that egypt scene diana prince and uh
steve i want to keep calling steve
rogers yeah
whatever his name is chris pines just
say chris blind they go to egypt
to find pedro pascal and they don't do
anything clever or do any sort of
detective work they're just driving on a
road and they happen to drive past him
that was him that was max lord oh yeah
in all of egypt right oh there he goes
please jump on his one road jack
based on this movie that's what i would
uh come to the conclusion because
that's a great action scene too that's
it's like complete schlock
that whole car chase scene oh that was
fine with that i would
no i was too because it was like
ridiculous it kind of felt like
like a lot of it was i was having like
raiders flashbacks you know that kind of
like you where you can see the ground
and you know they're only going 20 miles
an hour maybe 10 because the ground's
moving real slow
um and uh you could tell a lot of it was
real you know
obviously when cars are flying in the
air it's not real but
um it looked like real like spielbergie
and in camera kind of
like real cars and people some of it
yeah and not to like michael bayish and
cgi
some of the shots felt like there's a
like a head-on shot of her running down
the road
terrible the kids playing soccer
when she grabs them that shot of them
rolling where it's so clearly a dummy
it's like they just left that in the
movie and then they they go to egypt
because they find it
like a was it like a decommissioned jet
fighter
yeah it's at the uh smithsonian
yeah and i guess it's just completely
fueled up it's fueled up
it's it it's been fully maintenanced
within the last you know a couple days
yeah in a world where one pilot
can figure out how to fly right away and
and they don't need helmets
or ear protection in a jet
that is extremely loud they just sit in
it
and it's you can hear a pin drop in the
cockpit yeah
a commercial airliner's louder than that
yeah and they're just sitting there
inside the jet
like with nothing no helmet and and also
i'm i'm not an expert i mean he's he
says it in the film he's like wow you
have planes that can fly from here to
cairo
without refueling you have a plane that
can fly from here to cairo in one shot
again i'm not an expert i'm not an
aviation or or airplane expert
but just using common sense i don't
think a fighter jet can make it from
washington dc to cairo because they have
aircraft carriers
they land on to refuel they you know
they're meant for combat not for long
distance not like a like a commercial
airliner's meant for long distance so
i know i'm i'm making specific points
about a silly comic book movie
like like i said before something has to
matter
when you have a movie where you just
keep saying no this doesn't matter this
doesn't matter this doesn't matter it
all adds up
yeah because that same scene i'm
confused about uh
wonder woman's powers cause i guess she
kind of learns to fly in this movie
sort of but in that scene this is where
because i know
one of the few things that everybody
knows about wonder woman she has the
invisible jet
and they tried to cram that in here by
her just randomly out of nowhere
saying like you know i think when i was
a little kid once i kind of made
something turn invisible
maybe i'll just try that now i mean i
know they're trying to hide from
you know everyone else that's chasing
them yeah
but it's like just all of a sudden like
oh i made something invisible once
her father her father taught her a magic
spell
my father hit the mascara from the world
and i've been trying to learn how we did
it
she never thought to use it until this
very moment once you once you evoke
like like like a like a passed down
generational
thing that's that's woven into your
family structure that it gives it weight
if you just say oh one time i
figured out how to make something
disappear by like reading it
or watching a youtube tutorial then it
doesn't have so much weight my
father my father these are these are
these are tricks these are tricks of the
ear
sure that they use to to to fool the
weak-minded throw some schmaltzy music
under it
when i was a little you're not thinking
about the fact that wait she's never
done this before or
since sitting with a coffee cup and then
lost a coffee cup that that's supposed
to attention too
oh she did it once and it just sort of
worked is it gonna work this time
of course it is throw that stuff in
earlier in the movie so it pays off
you don't just like introduce it and
then have her do it immediately
it's the same with her golden suit that
shows up at the end they're in her
apartment at one point and it's like
wrapped in newspaper
he's like what's this thing he's like oh
that's a golden suit of armor
i don't know maybe i'll wear it someday
or something i don't know
well they'll come in handy if i ever
lose my powers
if i ever have to fight a cheetah woman
with rarely any powers because i lost
them
wishing on a magic stone
there's a little post-it note that says
all that
that's the problem with this movie is
like we're making fun of the the
how much jet fuel they have and just
nonsense because
because the the story line
the plot and setups payoffs
character arcs basic foundations of
a movie basic foundations are not there
yeah
it's like looking at a destroyed house
like that which is that's just crumbled
to pieces and we're like making fun of
like
the bathtub that's sitting out of like
wreckage you know what i mean
look at that bathtub you know what i
mean that's kind of what we're doing
because it's
the movie's such a mess that it's almost
hard to
nail down what to talk about i was just
thinking you know what makes that any
even worse when she wears that golden
suit of armor you were saying it's like
oh cause she's weak because she lost her
powers
at that point in the movie she has her
powers back again no no
yeah she does because she she gives up
steve rogers
no no she's she she uh she just says bye
to him
and and that's her renouncing her wish
no no she's
she she will renounce her wish in a
future date
in a future time and there is a moment
during the fight and i think that's the
moment she renounces her wish
you announced your wish i had to
and so do you but the weird thing is
once she runs away from chris pine
we never see him again yeah they should
have had chris pine standing there
and he like you know turns back into the
normal yeah
like morphed into that guy and but have
have him kind of standing there on the
on the street corner like maybe maybe
you could have him looking up at a plane
like watching a plane go by
you know and then like all of a sudden
he goes like this
like after that moment happens he goes
like wtf yeah we do see him again at the
very end
at the very end when they meet up and
he's himself but you
you're saying we need a visual cue that
she has renounced the way yes exactly we
see him turn back down
we know at the we know chris uh pine
died and she renounced her wish because
she got a powers back
she did it mid-fight but they didn't
they didn't tell us that visually about
yeah it's really
muddled it's like it's like chris chris
pine like left the set
after that like she ran away and his
last line is like diana i want to
forget you yeah it's like 80 yards by
like the guy who gets everybody coffee
yes that was really awkward i assume
that voice was supposed to be the
actual guy i don't know but i don't know
i think it was we don't see enough of
that actual guy
that whole subplot is [ __ ] weird and
that's a case of where we talk about
them not thinking anything out where
it's like
the moral implications of what's
happening there is so creepy
and the movie like somebody involved
with the movie has to understand that
and they just don't care oh the idea
that like
they've taken over this guy's body do
they have sexual intercourse
it's implied that they have sex and then
they they put that poor guy's body in
peril multiple times that's the big part
is throughout the movie yeah
and neither of them acknowledge how
[ __ ] up this is yeah
they're not like concerned about his
safety at all you would think they would
it just makes them both look really
selfish what makes diana look selfish
he's dead
he can't help it yeah and like somebody
involved with the movie had to
understand that this is weird
and they just said ah the audience won't
know because chris pine's back
and they'll they just want to see these
two together yeah because they were so
good in the first movie it was a stupid
way to bring them back they could have
done
anything i mean it's a superhero movie
well that's the thing is like the wishes
i wish that steve rogers was back go up
here just have him appear
the idea of having him like take over
somebody else's body is
bizarre it was bizarre and there's no
real logic to it
it's just a thing that they decided to
have happen yeah but at the very least
you could say
chris chris pine could say let's go to
egypt and
get that guy wait a minute won't i be
endangering
like this random guy's life and then
some acknowledgement don't worry i
protect you
don't worry i protect you okay
you know that's it done you know
acknowledge
or don't have that in the movie at all
that's another thing where it's like he
shouldn't even be in this movie
how did chris pine die in the first one
is playing he he sacrifices himself he
flies his plane up into the sky to stop
something i don't remember whatever the
threat is right so he's dead dead he's
blown up yeah and that's you know that
has some emotional weight to it they've
grown to love each other and he
sacrifices himself
so bringing him back for this movie just
so they have to
separate again at the end it's just like
repeating the same thing
he's just like a greedy megalomaniac
who just wants to make deals all over
the place
the art of the deal part of the deal
that's the name of the book and
by golly the movie brought it to my head
because that's what he's doing he's
making deals with people
he is a con man and he is a cheat
didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a low-life con
i am not a con man well there's that
facade of being
this big big man big company runs this
big company and then he goes into his
office and it's like empty and he
doesn't have any employees yes and at
heart he's a fraud
yeah and then to to hammer it home even
further at the end
he goes into a bunker a u.s government
bunker and is
standing in front of the president of
the united states seal
just screaming into the microphone
trying to start world war three
yeah and you don't get much clearer than
that which in the context of the movie
is bizarre
he just goes on tv and he looks like a
lunatic and his eyes are like
bloodshot zombie president everybody
start wishing for things
and everybody does but anyway he goes
into the oval office and then
he's trying to make a deal with the
president and then somehow he gets the
information that
there are satellites in orbit of earth
that will beam down a transmission to
any tv
which includes computer monitors somehow
in 1984
that that don't receive television
signals
not in 1984. i guess it's the government
they got a magical
super technology hidden in the mountains
how uses particle beam technology just
like the star wars program
apparently it bathes the landscape and a
signal of particles that goes in and
fiddles with any technology it touches
new or old broadcast whatever you want
but he's like he's like get me a chopper
and take me
i thought he said get me a chopper and
take me to the satellites like literally
to space and i'm like
what buddy he meant take him to the
bunker so he goes to the bunker and
they're like who are you and
he's like uh i bet you wish that i wish
that you wish that i would come in here
there's a lot of scenes in there
don't you wish for like yeah you do that
once
you can't have him do that for every
character that wishes for something yeah
but he gets on a podium and then
for no reason starts spinning whirlwinds
and there's like a there's like a
glowing rod of light
it looks like the inside of the death
star and
um he's like i'm troll
what are your wishes and um people and
and everyone around
the world wish something yeah and so
they show my favorite is the
the the irish guy in the restaurant
where he's like i wish you'd drop
dead and she says i wish that you'd go
back to where you came from
and immediately there's like a van
outside to police to deport him rounding
up the irish
like that very second it's great
forcibly deporting people jay
yeah the whole idea is that then
diana prince you know she gets on she
uses her magic
lasso to to tell the world to renounce
their wishes
so that's one we have to assume that
everybody in the entire world renounces
their wishes
and heard her and hurt her but also and
understands her because we're
broadcasting all over the world and
there's probably tons of people that
don't even speak english i don't know
what the [ __ ] she's saying
maybe somebody wished for a translator i
don't know but uh
she so everybody renounces their wishes
but
not every wish could be bad or selfish
right
like some people had to wish for good
things well it's not that it's a bad or
good wish it's just that
the renouncing the wishes
will deflate the power or stop the power
of the crystal
i guess i'm just thinking of somebody
like wishing like i wish i didn't have
cancer
wow and then that gets reverted they're
[ __ ]
does anybody just does the whole world
remember this incident or is it wiped
from their memories there's aftermath
of it so i assume so yeah i assume
because we see like missiles start to go
up but then they disappear when the
wishes are renounced
but we do see like rubble and the
world's all [ __ ] up so what happens
with pedro pascal does he just
he runs out and he he finds his son and
his son said i wish that
you loved me or something yeah how did
he get out of that
room or what happened i i don't remember
honestly i stopped watching the movie
i was like like walking around like
doing stuff
i left it on in the background i knew
something happened you missed diana's
big emotional speech
she says absolutely nothing i saw her
like
blabbing she's babbling about the truth
and the importance of
the truth yeah yeah and it's just like
complete nonsense
how to tell the whole world is being
honest true to yourself it's the one
great path
to being truthful and honest and this is
the truth
and platitudes yeah oh yeah that whole
end speech
and not only that but it keeps going
she starts giving her speech and i was
like okay that's it and then
it just she just keeps talking and
saying
nothing this world was a beautiful
place just as it was
and you cannot have it all
you can only have the truth
and the truth is enough
the truth is beautiful and then it just
goes around the world
and all these things are happening and
and all that dramatic music
and and it's just like the illusion of
emotion the illusion of something grand
happening
and it's like oh man i'll give it credit
though at the very least the ending is
not
a big cgi monster fight true
at least it's something kind of
different but the idea of like
like a crazy like fraudulent businessman
getting a hold of reminded me like the
lex luthor
plots in the yeah the early superman
movies where
where a fraudster businessman who's down
on his luck
happens upon some kind of thing that
makes him makes everything go awry you
know
that's kind of fun you get rid of
kristen wick yes um and and
just have him be the villain and but
don't take it to the
extreme levels that they did they they
just
they turned it up to 11. you know what i
mean and they didn't need to
but the ending of this is so dramatic
and serious being
serious so it's so so far away from
where it starts with that that mall
fight
and wonder woman didn't learn how to fly
that was you're supposed to be crying
then jay because that was after she ran
away from
steve rogers yeah who
was dying or dead or going to be dead
she knew that she had to renounce her
wish and she wouldn't see it
and so she ran and she flung her whip up
in the air and she
jumped up real high and she caught onto
an airplane and pulled herself up into
the sky
she flies up into the sky with the lasso
of truth didn't she have a sword in the
last movie
i feel like that was her big weapon and
the last movie was a sword do they tone
that down for the kids
in this one does she have a sword i
don't remember that she had some sort of
other weapon anyway what i was saying
was
she flew and she could she was like kind
of going on momentum
you know yeah and then she was flying
and um then she lasso was
a cloud stop
the point is in her mind she hears
steve guttenberg's voice and he's like
flying is
it's a magical thing you catch the wind
and
it lifts you up oh yeah that's what he's
saying about flying he's playing
he's waxing poetic about flying saying
empty planets about flying and flight
and how magical it is
and um and she remembers his his words
and it gives her the inspiration to fly
and then you know that starts to fall
but then she keeps it going she lasso is
lightning
she lasts as a cloud and then she laughs
as lightning yeah that was okay that's
kind of cool
and the light i don't know how you lasso
light that's again though that's like
that's so goofy you got to play it as
goofy but this is the big emotional crux
of the film
it doesn't work all the like going back
to sam raimi's uh spider-man movies
those are very silly movies they have
emotional moments but they're emotional
moments that are
uh grounded in character stuff
yeah the second spider-man movie is
great it's like there's a ton of silly
stuff in that but
you connect with the character yeah and
there's no character
to connect with in this wonder woman is
and gal gadot is like worse than she was
in the last movie too
yeah there's there's no like there's
there's nothing no charm
yeah like the la i'm i okay i kind of
first one's coming back to me a little
they're in like london
and they're walking around kind of doing
spy stuff and there's some little cutesy
romance stuff between them yeah back and
forth yeah all the the
the stuff between those two characters
in the first movie works yeah they're
trying to do something like with the
him putting on 80s clothes montage yeah
and it just all falls flat and then
they're
they barely do anything i don't remember
what they do in the movie i know they go
to egypt
and then they he he kicks a tank
and then oh
we'll have paddy jenkins write a script
come up with a story
like seriously i think i think the first
one did so well they were so happy to
have a dc movie that wasn't bad
yeah and they were like red carpet yeah
did you notice how every man in the
movie like aggressively hit on
both the women characters yeah i mean i
know what they're doing like i get that
but but it wasn't like i don't know the
the drunk guy
that's like kristen wiig and i mean at
least they
i well nobody dies in the movie there's
that part where she starts like kicking
the [ __ ] out of him
and it's like okay he's getting his
comeuppance for
being a drunk creep yeah
but if you want to make her evil have
her kill him and then you're like oh
okay now she's gone too far we're going
for a g rating
yeah yeah it feels so clean like nobody
dies in this whole movie i don't think
so
kristen wig picks up the drunk guy and
she throws him
against a van or a truck
to the point where it dents the truck
and then the guy falls back on the
ground
and then he gets up yeah i'm sorry
but if you if your body
dents steel you don't get back
up your back is shattered
i think they forgot that he wasn't a
superhero
you know i mean that he was just a
regular person what it's a superhero
movie
people get thrown into cars so hard they
dent
the car and i'm not just talking about
like a flimsy
you know like you know car door or
something
like he he puts a clear huge
indent in a and truck and it gets back
up
wow that's a superhero but does now does
he have superpowers i don't know where's
the script
does it matter does it matter nothing
matters that's the motto of this film
absolutely nothing matters tone
characters character motivation
story plot
special effects
at some point something has to matter
yeah and it's weird too because there
there aren't like you said there is no
monster fight at the end so
there aren't like super long
bloated action sequences like your uh
your zack snyder movies yeah it just
goes on for
you've got a headache because there's so
much action yeah this just has
for two and a half hours it has like two
actions there's a scene in like the
white house or oh yeah the government in
the hallway there
yeah and it's like christian wig before
she becomes the
the cat lady yeah i think that's
supposed to be the big show stoppers
that
that cheetah fight at the end yeah but
they shot the whole thing
with no lights so you can't see what the
[ __ ] is happening
yeah that's a weird can't beat up pedro
pascal he's just a human being
yeah so she has to fight cat lady
cheetah
chatara and um yeah
yeah i think you're right that's like
the big boss minor boss fight
how does it go this off the rails yeah
that's that's it's really confusing
right
it's it's the problem is well i was
gonna say the problem is the script but
the problem is
the script and the direction well you
can't
direct a terrible script it's a mystery
what happened here
it's a big mystery because it is it is a
big old mess
yeah and uh the first one was good we
actually liked the first one
um and this one just oh god just so many
bad decisions
you know i'm not so keen on this one i
figure uh you are but
you know what i'm ready to go i think we
can do better
so jay would you recommend wonder woman
1984.
uh if you have hbo max why not i i'm
going to say it's
there's parts of it that are
entertaining in a spider-man 3 kind of
way
where it's like like what were they
thinking kind of way
so put like a postmortem kind of like
viewing yeah
uh not like if if theaters were still
open i would say definitely don't
[ __ ] paint a seat in the theater but
right
don't buy hbo max don't buy hbo max just
to get watch this no
yeah i i would i would say yeah if you
do have hbo max
watch the first like half of this movie
and turn it off like i was like fast
forwarding
yeah i had the luxury like that whole
like
25 minute long ending where the all the
stuff's happening and he's screaming
into the podium and
all the wishes and and i was just like
no no forward progression is happening
this is just stretching it and there's
just this
loud music playing what are women's just
rambling about the truth
she's rambling about something and i'm
just fast forwarding until the next
thing occurs on screen that i know has
changed the scenario
halfway through it becomes a disgusting
boring slog
that that is super heavy it takes itself
way too seriously it becomes
a nightmarish mess that's the best way
to describe it so
if you want to feel all those things
watch wonder woman 1984
or watch half of wonder woman 1984 or
don't watch it at all
you're not missing much if if you skip
it i would say watch doom patrol instead
a much much better dc product
that i thoroughly enjoyed
let someone else write the script patty
you don't gotta write the script too you
suck at it
actually i would recommend it guess
that's the end
