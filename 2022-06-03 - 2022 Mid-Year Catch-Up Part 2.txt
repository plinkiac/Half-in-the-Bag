up oh
ah ah now that service
well now we're going to talk about movies you got your your Boomer paper out
we've seen a few films this year none of them are the Batman what do you want to talk about first you
want to talk about what we both seeing together sure you should wait till the end to talk about uh uh
even though it was a big flop in the theaters but whatever was that yeah but what isn't a big flop well that's that's
what we'll talk about that uh did you watch uh I'm gonna start with one of my favorite movies this year uh which I
don't think anybody saw I don't know uh it's called all my friends hate me
I have not seen this one I recommended it to you I know but I didn't see it yeah
listen Pete just so you know you're not doing too well been a bit crap haven't
you what uh it's a movie a British movie I believe
uh about a guy who goes to uh like a reunion thing at a house it's
like his birthday party uh he's very paranoid and there's all these weird
things that happen I don't want to talk about it too much
oh in terms of like details okay but he shows up there and all of his friends
are kind of being cold to him and there's this like weird guy like local weird guy that shows up he starts like
messing with everybody and you you never quite know like who's with him and who's
against him it's like psychological [ __ ] off and it culminates in a really
great a satisfying ending that's both shocking and uncomfortable okay at the
same time but it's really like kind of like a fun little paranoid is it like a
dark comedy dark comedy paranoia infused dark comedy that uh is is pretty well
done wow this is uh horrible actually yeah mate
that's yeah too far that's good that's one of those random there's so many random movies that just show up on the
story mean you're like what the hell is this did it come out this year is it even a movie do you ever even though
trailers are only like a minute and a half or two minutes do you ever get like 45 seconds into a trailer and just say
no oh yeah not even 45 seconds
hi we're back we had such a lovely time at the park pity you missed it who's we
huh what the
hell
it makes me feel bad to have that short of attention span but sometimes you just know immediately I'll shut a trailer off
if I can tell that it's like a low budget like crap thing sure that and you
know Voodoo lists the Rotten Tomatoes score so it's like well okay and then you go you click on it and um
it'll have the actors and if none of the actors have pictures it's like a bad sign then you turn on the trailer and
you get the at the header you get the the three or four production companies and you're like
wild eye releasing you see oh yeah yeah gravitas Ventures although they've they've been producing some better stuff
releasing some better stuff hey they're bound to eventually yeah you're at least 500 movies a year a couple of them got
to be good here's here's a tip
uh if it's a low budgety thing and they're trying to hook you in
and they're trying to trick you I got that drone shot at the opening
imagine you're a bird flying over the story of your life see all of your past
I'm going to ask you about your hallucinations now and it's like
because they think drone is like instant production value even though you buy drones for 30 bucks at Best Buy now
everybody's got drone shots yeah and it's like okay you got the Drone shot and you open with that like oh real
movie until you see the actors and then they talk so Paul
was your money whenever we sell us done and then you see like what kind of
camera was used and then you're like nope my girl is Missing
oh leave me alone what do you want no nobody's gonna die here
well now I mean Productions are mostly back to normal now with some restrictions here and there but the
movies that are coming out now are the ones that were produced like early into the pandemic and so now they're coming
out and they already feel dated when they're about like two people in a house or whatever
look
speaking of pandemic I'll move on oh uh potential pandemic movie uh all set in
one location okay that was a movie called windfall I didn't think I've heard of this one uh
yeah exactly I don't know where I saw it um but Jason Siegel
Jesse plemons oh I did see this and Lily Collins who is the daughter of Phil Collins is it
called windfall it's called windfall I watched this movie this guy breaks into my house
and you just sit down on the couch okay but how about you you let go of my wife first
and I've had to hold his hand how does this open is there a trick to the person no there's a clasp it's on Netflix there
we go I completely forgot it existed and I forgot the name of it but I have seen this film yeah it was pretty good yeah
Jesse plemons plays uh like a mark zuckerberg-esque character who's a
billionaire and and Lily Collins is kind of like early trophy wife she doesn't really she
didn't really want to marry him and he's kind of like you know ah you don't have to go work you don't have
to pursue your dreams you're my wife yeah yeah it's it's not a game okay and
not that I have to justify my resume to you but right now I'm in charge of building schools and hospitals or just
four continents so you can try and belittle what I do all you want but the results speak for themselves and you can
go ahead and question my motives but at least I know what I'll be doing for the next four or five years that's not exactly true
you'll be taking on more of an advisory role once we have a baby
all right babe right that's the plan and then they don't push that too hard
to work they don't cause that too hard no no it's not it's not like like stock characters right but then Jason Siegel
shows up to Rob them he thinks they're gone and his backstory is a little shady
you don't he might have worked for him it's never really quite revealed yeah they keep it vague which is good um and
he has a he has a grudge against him and then it kind of becomes this like awkward situation where he's trying to
get him to pay him two million dollars but he's like I gotta call my bank and
it's gonna take him like a day to get here it's a Saturday and you want um you know they discuss the amount of money he
wants there he's like how about a hundred thousand dollars and and Jesse plemons is like well
I mean you probably want more than that it's not going to last you very long in the grand scheme of things how about
three hundred thousand dollars oh same thing 150 000 dollars
what what is so [ __ ] funny 150 000 150 000.
you think that's enough yeah I think you're probably gonna want more than that and they negotiate and
he's negotiating for him and uh so they bring the money and then well then because I think they have to wait for
the Buddy to show that's that most of the buddies are most of the movies I'm just like hanging out that's the meat of the movie it's very character driven
very dialogue very character driven he's uh Jason Siegel's talking with Lily Collins about their relationship and
they're sort of like bonding a little um and uh and then it just kind of ends
in a little shock shock and just disturbing stuff happens and but it's
it's it holds itself up as a movie that's shot just in a house yeah and doesn't
leave the house three well four characters someone else shows up but it's almost exclusively these three characters but yeah it works because the
writing is so strong and the performances are good yeah it's nice to see I generally like Jason Siegel he
kind of vanished for a while I don't know where he's been he stopped acting but he's good in this
completely forgot about this movie and I had to look up speaking of the writing of it I looked up the writer and
it's Andrew Kevin Walker who wrote seven and I think he wrote Panic Room oh yeah
yeah uh and then he hasn't like written anything in like 15 years and then just all of a sudden he comes back with this
really like small scale kind of intimate movie which I thought was really interesting I don't know what he's been
doing but cash and checks Andrew Kevin Walker's back he wrote seven he wrote seven uh
the what's in the Box movie yeah yeah I saw you with the Box what was in the Box called the what's in a box oh what's in
the box that's you have your your you hate when people quote the one line from Ghostbusters
or like if people ask if you've seen a God or if you're a God you say yes and it drives you nuts that it's so
overcoated I'm like that with what's in the box oh what's in the box whenever
anyone says like hey you got a box there and then they start doing it what's in the box no what's in the box it's not as
lengthy as uh Ray Ray when someone asks you want to ask you if
you're gone let's say start the line you're like I'm done yeah yeah we know what it's from stop hurry it up with
what's in the box it's more of the anticipation where it's like I know they're gonna say it I got a box someone's gonna say what's
in the box and then I'm going to want to punch him in the face I hear you I hear you and I enjoyed the film yeah it was
good it was I I guess not good enough where I remembered that I saw it until you mentioned not even the title but
what happens literally in the film then I remembered that I watched it okay but that's you know this is a smaller film
as I've always said our our our brands have only so much memory storage that's
true
foreign it's gonna be a long night
speaking of pandemic I'll move on on oh jackass forever
I didn't watch it you didn't watch it you told me you did Jack yes the new Jackass film Jack has
forever oh wait I did watch the new Jackass film yeah what are you me I'm losing my mind all these movies
foreign Knoxville welcome to Jackie uh what'd
you think of Jack has forever um sporadically very funny there's there's a kind of cathartic quality to
watching these people just abuse themselves that's funny and always has been but now that they're older
it's kind of scary there's a part early on where they they
lock people in a room and they shut off all the lights and they're trying to scare them with like snakes and [ __ ] and
I was like I don't know it just made me more uncomfortable than funny I was like that is the stuff I don't like in
jackass there's certain things where I was like Amazed by I love the bear
the bear when they let the bear out in the room and the guys like trapped to the chair and he's got like food in his
underwear yeah um and clearly there's a bear Handler like one foot away and the door ready to
make sure and then I like stuff like whoo and then when they brought the vulture
I'm like oh my God that's a vulture and they're like it's like picking something
out of somebody's underwear yeah they have like pieces of meat on them yes I think there's a thing where
when you're young and you're like I'm Johnny Knoxville and
this is smack me in my knots and you're like okay you know you're in your 20s
and you have more of a resilience to this stuff you have a resilience and your brain's not quite formed yet but
then when you're like in your late 50s and and Johnny Knoxville gets injured on the bull they do the same yeah and I'm
like yeah that's the part where you're like okay yeah all right that was a violent brawl
one-sided to be sure should we good yeah you got exactly what you wanted so what
happened after it hit me well they brought in younger people for this one but I don't think they do any of the really dangerous stuff did they what was
the point of them
it's unspoken but you know what the point was
yes that I've really responded to no to me it's always been like they do a little bit with the old man character
and this he goes to a furniture store that's that's all me that's the stuff I like there is a pranks yeah I I love
pranks
oh my God right and and nobody does better than
Johnny Knoxville when he's Hermann zisman uh Henry zussman whatever his name is uh
uh when he does his old man and and that's why Bad Grandpa some of my AFI top 100 greatest films of
all time they cut out all the fat I don't like smacking watching people get mutilated and smacked in their nuts and
hurt it's just not my thing uh some people may just laugh hysterically at people
getting injured I I just don't like that um but I certainly love
hidden camera pranks especially when they're outrageous
Herman's has been spraying diarrhea on the wall and it's Annie's old which you know is
something that makes me really laugh a lot yeah I liked I liked previous jackass films more when there's more
like hidden camera stuff I I that's that's my thing but there were some pretty this this made me more
nervous than than laugh at a lot of the things in it scenes that they because I think they started shooting right before
the pandemic and then the pandemic hit and it kind of got delayed but then they filmed more stuff so there's some skits
in it where his hair still dyed black he's still trying to look younger yeah and then at some point he just said [ __ ] it I gave up and now he's just got white
hair um so kind of going back and forth depending on you know what scenes you're in it's sort of interesting and that
kind of gives it a different feeling as well where it's like at some point he gave up on trying to still
pretend to be young but they're still doing these bits hello my name is Johnny Knoxville and
this is the marching band
practicing not the window back to myself but I can't remember
nothing speaking of pandemic we'll move on on oh
uh I watched a movie called ultrasound yes you watched it I've seen ultrasonic
yeah from Mad Men uh we were talking about this when our friend Jack Wade was
in town we're talking about shooting during the pandemic he shot the screen movie with the masks on everyone had
masks and we were talking about that and the subject of ultrasound came up because there is a shot or two in the
movie where our Vincent karthiser has
indentation lines from his covet mask on his face just see it in the movie and and it's
like you know and you're like oh right he's wearing the mask until they say
action take the mask off yeah say your lines put the mask on and all that
leaves the left the rubber mark on his cheek but uh see I didn't notice that because I was too distracted trying to
figure out what the [ __ ] was going on
it's a wild movie it's a very good movie um I was kind of irritated for the first
half or so maybe even a little longer because it's so disjointed where it's
like okay at some point you got to give me something and I was getting it was going on a little too long before giving
me something to figure out what is happening because where it's very disconnected it's cutting between all these different things and you're like
what is this but once you get to that point where you realize what is happening then it was great yeah and I
think it'd probably hold up better on second viewing kind of going into it sure with a better understanding of that yeah because he's coming from a wedding
his car breaks down he ends up at this house oh there's like this
creepy dead daughter living in the house and he's like you want to have sex with my daughter in the bed why why would I
do that why would I do that are you not attracted to her maybe I was mistaken I haven't even thought about that why would I why would I think about whether
I was a I don't know if but I saw you looking at her come on what you the looks you were staring at her come on
whoa It's like what and then and then he can't remember what happened and then a
little while later the Dad shows up at his apartment and he's like you impregnated my daughter and I'm like
what but then we're inner cutting with other scenes that feel completely disconnected yeah but then you get the
it's been a while since I've seen this so I'm a little fuzzy but uh they are
under some kind of mental experiments in like a hospital and then you know it's
one of those like well then it becomes a yeah what's real what's not what are they hallucinating and it becomes kind
of one of my favorite sort of sub-genres of like sci-fi is that people trying to escape some sort of like oppressive
Society or or worlds or organization things like I don't know thx1138 or
Beyond the Black rainbow and it kind of turns into that and that's when I was really on board I was really distracted
early on because the dad the older guy was like where do I know him from and then I realized he has one scene in
Fight Club he's a guy that works at the uh the airport when he's making the assumption that Edward Norton's uh bag
had a dildo in it so he likes that guy how the [ __ ] did you remember that I had
to look it up I didn't remember it was dry it was driving me nuts because I was like I recognized that guy that's he's
the dildo guy at the airport that's my story
it's not safe for us there anymore we have to bring them out if a suggestion in stages
all right but uh yeah no ultrasound I like I said I think it would hold up better on his second viewing yeah it
almost Demands a second viewing because it's got It's So disjointed and uh
confusing at first what is going on I I can't explain it to me at this stage in
the process right and it's one of those movies where from the cover it looks like
it's a junk movie and then I I saw who was in it and I'm like okay
went like with the exception let me let me just put this in all capital letters
okay with the exception of Bruce Willis movies uh where it's like Thomas Jane Bruce
Willis uh Frank Grillo Frank Eric Roberts where you see like those names where it's like
they're bigger names uh but you know it's gonna be bad but when you see like random like you know
like I saw Christina Ricci or Vincent karthiser or whatever and it's like okay
they're still relatively they're working actors working actors
that aren't past their Prime yet and they're they're the main characters so they're not going to be someone that was on set for one day yeah so you know like
at least it's going to be a decent film it's not going to be like like low budget you know trash
this seems like a movie that somebody wanted to make it wasn't made to like a geezer teaser or it's just to trick
older people into watching an action movie where there's no action it's in the arena of like uh like a sensor or a
possessor where it has good casts decent budget still low
it's not playing in all the all the major theaters around the country but it's still
it's worth your money to rent it yeah for 3.99 absolutely
speaking of pandemic move on on oh I watched a movie called King night
I'm so sorry I'm a work in progress
uh it's cool man we've all got poo in our butts
all of us Matthew Gray Gubler and I forget the actress's name
the director Richard Bates Jr
very disappointing I I he his first movie was called excision which I love I
think it's a fantastic super low budget movie uh and then every movie is made since
then I thought has sucked uh something Suburban Gothic right also
with Matthew Ray Gubler Matthew Gray Gubler and Kat Dennings I don't think I
even finished it the just cringe terrible comedy um and they did a couple other movies
after that one that I when I was looking up recent stuff was like oh I watched that movie and I completely forgotten it
existed so it's very disappointing because I I think excision is so good and it's so strong like with his voice
like it feels like oh this is somebody's Vision but then every movie else has been like oh yeah that's why I didn't
even bother with the new one yeah I don't know why I watched it I thought the trailer looked funny
I like the premise uh but when you watch it it's uh
I think it was mostly improv but we're full of [ __ ] we don't have poo in her butts I got
some poo in my butt right now wait even Julia benoch has poo in her butt
and Julie panoche um uh oh gosh Andy Milonakis is in it you
remember him I remember hating milanakas [ __ ] you man
oh God it's like uh Matthew Gray Gubler
plays a guy who is part of this like witch cult Wiccan cult
and they're all like very like you know we're wiccans and we love the Earth and
they live in a commune and but it turns out like his dark past is that he was like like a preppy guy in his high
school it was like what sport did you play all right the cross
played football see that's a funny premise that's exactly yeah he's ashamed
of his horrible past of being just a normal guy if if it's a if it's in a
it's a perfect example of a great premise that just is underutilized to the nth degree it's
just like God awful what doesn't suck these days
in almost every way sadly um from like the really awkward bad improv
to like the ending and I think again this might be a covet thing the ending
was supposed to take place as it is like high school reunion
and he's like debating whether or not to go he gets outed as being a former Normie
not a true Wiccan uh there's like a zoom call with his mother who's like
screaming at him oh it's Barbara Crampton right it's Barbara Crampton and and uh
she's not there and then it's like and then he goes to the reunion and it's like it's very like it feels so like low
budget the sword has been returned to its
rightful owner let's say you we [ __ ] party like if you made it with like a hundred
bucks where he goes in and their film outside and he goes in and goes up on the stage and there's like
like five people and there's also a part where he's talking to someone at like a
like a like a table like a high top table like at a reception where you have your drinks on it I think
and they have like green screen people walking back and forth oh nothing to
give it the illusion that it's crowded oh but as they're walking they're like smearing the green pixels oh my God by
real fast and they might even be plug-ins wow not actual elements they shot yeah
uh and then like the wide shot of him on stage there's like four people and they're spread out and then they I think
it's incredibly awkward you know it does not feel like it was a
stage scene at a big high school reunion where there's all these people and characters and all these things it just
feels so like stripped down and awkward and I'm picturing a gross point blank John Cusack movie because that's the
whole leading up to his high school reunion you get the big wide shot of the reunion and all the people and those
days are over no enchantment Under the Sea dance in this in this world today
uh it's like uh and then a lot of the humor just fell flat just constantly
falling flat humor a really strange
not to be confused groundbreaking album left at the middle
it's hard to describe unless you watch it and I would recommend watching it just just to get a c just to see as a
learning tool how badly something can fail with good intentions I guess with good
comedic intentions I mean the premise like I said that sounds like a great concept yeah uh kind of the inverse of
you know someone who has a dark weird past and now they're normal like yeah that's great yeah the surprising thing
is the endless positive reviews um
where it's like I'm my reading uh another language to human beings see this movie or these
Bots like how could anyone find this movie good you know I'm poo in her butts
speaking of pandemic we'll move on on well speaking of you mentioned looking at the Rotten Tomatoes scores we saw a
movie uh called Fresh yeah does that have a fresh Rotten Tomato score you
know I don't know you'll be very curious hilarious if it didn't if ironically fresh had a a splat
uh fresh there's a movie about a guy who eats women so
I called Jay and he saw it the second it came out
how you called me an old rotary phone hey have you seen this new cannibal film
latest motion picture it was more like this oh yeah uh fresh
I don't know how you do it hating people no no you do not need a
man okay so don't play the games just be you straight out the gate
do you live around here because I live on aisle six that was terrible
it was kind of terrible I I admired it's very different in terms of its structure
it's like half the movie before it gets to the title of the film and the first half is almost like a romantic comedy
and then takes a draft I like movies like that where it's like it's one like I don't know From Dusk Till Dawn or something where it's kind of one thing
and then it just takes such a sharp turn and I admire that more than I actually liked the movie because once it takes
that turn it just kind of feels like it goes on forever I was like I got it she's being held captive and he's a
cannibal it's like okay I get it yeah it goes on for like an hour longer than it should right and then they have a chance
to kill him in the kitchen but they don't finish the job no that's
foreign
cliche it's just it's so simple where it's like they're held captive and they got to get away and then they get away
again done before that's what cliched means I guess but it's not even like I
don't know there's nothing engaging about the the story at that point well I think it was
on the line it didn't know which direction it wanted to go you know you
with with something like that you can go campy and silly with him like eating
like he has pieces of feet and legs and hands in the fridge yeah
you know you can go sound to the Lambs kind of way more psychological
psychological scary weird I think they kind of tried to do that because she's trying to I thought they were going
goofy because well you don't show him he starts feeding her the meat you
know yeah maybe it was just the way it was shot or the actors or well you could even end up with like a dark comedy
angle if it was like like I said the first half is like a romantic comedy and if the rest of the movie had that kind
of bright poppy look to it but it's about such dark subject matter that contrast could make it interesting but
it just feels like generic yeah like you said like lifetime Thriller a little bit more extreme because of the cannibalism
angle but yeah totally and it's so like early on
the first scene she goes on a date with a guy and he's like everything yeah it's
so like okay I gotta you're showing awful men but it's like every bad thing about any bad date you've ever been on
it's all encapsulated in this one guy he's such an extreme [ __ ] it's like it's unrealistic right from the get-go
right the women in our parents generation they just they were more into femininity you know what I mean because
I think you would just look great in a dress but I mean if you were pretty much done actually thank you he was way over
the top you could have done a montage of dates that she goes on where they're they're they're fine but there's a
little something wrong yeah that would have grounded it more in reality they kind of set the stage with with uh
goofiness or over the top and then unintentional goofiness unintentionally
yeah which which is like but to us it comes off as goofy it comes off his over
the top you're spelling it out way too much yeah for the audience and and so you're just like well now what
oh okay and then he drugs her and you're like this is getting interesting because honestly I didn't know about the
cannibal angle well that's what makes it interesting is yeah it goes on so long before it gets to that I don't think
they spoil that in the trailer it's just more of a kidnap kind of movie okay I
think even giving that away like if the trailer looked like just a romantic comedy trailer and you don't know what
you're getting into they don't do that they don't do that they wouldn't do that I know but they should the tricky
trailer my dad started watching From Dusk Till Dawn on cable ones not knowing where it
was going he's like it was a pretty good thriller and then I had to turn it off because on the vampires show up yeah
they don't usually try to completely trick people with trailers yeah like if
you if you made a movie where it's just like a straight up rom-com kind of thing and you just sell it like that and then
you everyone goes to see it and it turns into just something super [ __ ] up see
I think you can get away with taking risks like that on streaming certainly this was precious made for Hulu like
obviously if you have a theatrical release people are paying money to go see it in the theater they're going to be horribly pissed if you give them a
bait and switch but something that's like direct to streaming like yeah take some chances do some weird [ __ ] what was
the movie somewhat recently where a lady sued the film company
because the the movie it it looked like it was supposed to be like an action it wasn't drive it wasn't I know what
you're talking about that baby driver it was something like that where she thought it was going to be like a Fast
and the Furious movie where they're driving cars yeah but that was like I vaguely know what you're talking
about misleading in the trailer and so that's why you gotta be careful with your trailers
because crackpots will sue you you you yeah if it's a street beat service what are they gonna do Sue Hulu for one movie
I don't know I think it's different in the age of extreme have they come up with a false advertisement laws in terms
of trailers I don't know
this is a destiny Destiny because yeah you could you could say like this movie is a the warmest
heartwarming is rom-com of the Year says Entertainment Weekly
I don't know Anna Kendrick Hannah Kendrick and uh
John Cena she's a she's a high school teacher
he's an ex-wrestler who has to get a job at the high school teaching wrestling
and they fall in love and then the movie's about him like
stabbing her 68 times in the in the locker room
and that dismembering her corpse and burning it in the middle of the football
field and then like locking all the doors to the school when there's like a
staff meeting and like slowly and methodically killing all the other teachers because they made five of them
yeah because he used to be a famous WWE wrestler and he now he has to wrestle at
high school and he snaps yeah and and a big and one after the other he kills a science teacher he kills the math
teacher they all mocked him throughout the film and in the first half loving happy hey you used to be Mr uh I don't
know what's a good wrestler name Jay I don't know Mr muscles
on the WWE now you're a teacher in high school sure things went downhill for you Mr
muscles what do you do I teach geometry I'm Mr
spectacles well Mr spectacles we all have uh pitfalls in life but uh we have
weeds come out of them oh and then Mr spectacles he takes two
like ice picks jams them through as spectacles
and that's the twist right there that's when the movie takes the turn yeah right at that moment he and I'd make a geometry pun but I
know nothing about geometry don't give them ideas Mike it's me the
art teacher use some kind of homosexual no I'm just super fun buoyant my wife's
embarrassed to go places with me well I'm just gonna assume that you're a homosexual and snap your neck
he doesn't kill him with any sort of like art supplies or anything uh uh no he's not that clever oh okay he
just stabs people all right my point is uh I've gone off the rails here but my point is uh
fantasy come true right
speaking of pandemic we'll move on on oh well last but not least we have the
final nail in the coffin of theatrical releases that aren't Disney products the
northmen yeah this was uh obviously I was interested to see it because it's Robert
Eggers I think he's one of the best filmmakers working today and I was shocked before it came out to read that
it had a 90 million dollar budget which obviously that's not Marvel money but
it's pretty big for a movie that isn't a known IP from a director that makes small more abstract movies and I was
like you know what that's probably going to be a good movie and it's probably going to flop and I was right on both uh accounts I
was I was really surprised uh because it's they as everybody always says now there are no mid-budget movies there's
Marvel Disney products and then there's streaming movies which are usually these
days much lower budget so this is like I don't know someone took a chance it's like yeah let's try another
non-franchise theatrical movie big epic thing and they won't be making that
mistake again it's such a shame because it's a great movie it's a really well done movie
and it is his most accessible movie um it's not the lighthouse which is
weird and perverted and black and white like it's a very straightforward Revenge
historical film uh but still done really well when you say Robert ecker's most accessible film
it's a bar that's pretty low because it's that's that's the phenomenon I
discovered after watching this movie and looking into it is that you know it's
one of those with a higher critical rating but in the 60s for audience reaction oh really oh yeah
we're joking
well no I would I would definitely not be surprised by something like that for like the witch or or the lighthouse but
I would think this movie would be liked by people that saw it let's start off this by a little research I did okay
um one of my favorite pastimes is reading reviews uh and and I knew
the moment this movie started that it would be polarizing and I think that's part of the the box office
failure I guess see I just saw it as like a pretty straightforward movie like
a Revenge movie it wasn't terribly slow paced which I think that's an accusation as other
movies have people say it's slow and boring nothing happens lots of [ __ ] happens in this movie
uh I guess I guess I've just approaching it from a different mindset can I I'll just
say something very simplistic that will open your mind a little okay
Art House Braveheart sure right that's a Braveheart is a simplistic straightforward movie that
appeals to the masses yeah this is that but done very artistically and
abstractly and uh less accessible than something like a Braveheart okay I guess
I'm just looking at it compared to other Robert Eggers movies but I I the only Robert eckers movie I've seen is the
witch I haven't seen Lighthouse yeah and the witches like nice nicely held in its
little niche area for people that want to watch something like the witch right
um I think his first foray into making a widely accessible movie had its
stumblings well I did people like you and me will appreciate it and enjoy it
it's a Titanic's that Braveheart it's not one of those historical movies where it knows how to deal with its audience
he's he's gr he's a great filmmaker he's very visual
there's a lot of brutality and a lot of like shock and and great performances
and Artistry I think the sad thing is I mean I guess I agree with you but I
think if a movie like Braveheart where we were released today like exactly as it is I think even Braveheart would not
do well that's not nothing makes money in the theaters anymore the theater system is
totally different now that's what I mean like I I think this movie is people don't go to the theater this is not
Braveheart Braveheart is is for for like average people oh God who are
manipulated easily by an emotional very simplistic storyline and raising
speeches we will be kind and call bravehearted crowd pleaser
okay it's like um Gladiator yeah it's a crowd pleaser
why are you not entertained are you not entertained
this is not why you were here where it's accessible to mostly everyone
this is not uh you know you know I I have some screen grabs for you and you
can display them here also great send them all to you later took screen grabs okay because when you go through the the
uh the reviews it evenly fluctuates between a one star and
five stars half star review just a bunch of men screaming at each
other
they should put that on the poster hissing and spitting like rapid raccoons
we gotta watch out for those rapid raccoons yeah they live in the water I live in the Colorado Rapids a terrible
movie half star stupid Shakespearean misplaced dialogue
goofy caveman dancing a cross between movies Greece and Avatar
what I'm still hung up on grease and Avatar
I've tried to picture how you get to those two Avatar because they're uh
they don't live in houses I don't get it uh yeah in Greece because they all wear leather jackets of course sure yeah
there's musical numbers and this was the 850s so that's close to the 1950s uh
this was one of the worst movies I have seen I was embarrassed about the plot
uh okay this is the best the best one by far okay no this isn't funny it's clever
oh okay uh well appropriate first half good period second half not
so good their score
do you think they did that on purpose though uh maybe horrible
long and drawn out save money and time
my family saw this with me my wife walked out and my two boys gave it an F
foreign
I'll read a couple five stars right okay brilliant film a huge epic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen
possible hopefully the academy will remember this film when it comes Awards time because it's worthy of best picture
followed by suck like all of his movies just stupid to me
and I looked fed to it all the same
uh yeah oh here's I'll throw a five star in okay beautiful brutal
and masterfully crafted in every way well I would agree with that one what
did you love about it Jay uh the way it's told like I said it's when I I guess when I say it's accessible I mean
the story is very straightforward compared to his other movies of course which I guess I read that he didn't have
like Final Cut on it so a studio came in and maybe his was told a little more out
of order or something but it's very laid out in a very linear fashion
um so I don't know if he's gonna get a movie on this budget made anymore after after this but it was interesting
because he's so like he's like a like a history nerd like he's very hung up on
details and uh and having all the little details be accurate and you know okay
reflective of the period the story takes place and and that shows him this it's a
very like detail-oriented but still on the larger scale is telling this complete story it's not like hung up on
the details um we joked off camera about Nicole Kidman being in the movie and uh that
kind of Falls away from his idea of making things historically accurate because I don't think they had plastic surgery back then but or shampoo or
shampoo but it does feel yeah I guess like yeah the hair and stuff that no one looks quite as dirty as they probably
would so maybe that's the part of compromising with working with a studio can't have everybody coming in Phil I
don't know a lot about that history but this is super early on yeah to where it's like I don't know if they would be
speaking the way they do in the movie necessarily I I I would imagine so I mean they they took the time to have the
official like font or writing for the different kind of chapters yeah and so
if you say that he's a history nerd like that's good well that was one of the complaints about the witch because
everybody speaks in this dialect that's very hard to understand if you're like I don't know what they're saying
love you I love they Marvel as well
she's got a lot not Martin what knows who was the son of Abraham and who is not
Phil I will say you she's on me just to quiet her I mean it's easy
to discover like if there's writings from that period and blah blah blah but it's you know the the Norse mythology
and their religion and all the things they believe there's there's one line in there that I laughed at was their
religion is they worship a dead guy who was nailed to a tree and it was like
such a crass like weird way to describe it and I'm like okay that that makes
sense and um yeah the way they talk but then but then there were Parts where it's like
you're playing a little dangerous game with that kind of time period because you've got
I kept thinking of Monty Python and the Holy Grail
need velocity of an unladen swallow
every time I try to talk to someone it's
sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and you get some of the costumes
sometimes they look really dirty and gross and sometimes they look kind of clean and you're like well yeah and does it
feel quite historically accurate you got this plot
Shakespearean simple very straightforward Revenge story you like
the story I'm going to grow up and get my revenge yeah and to me it just kind
of like it had me and then it didn't have me
that had me and it didn't have me and ultimately at the end I really liked it
I appreciated it let's say that yeah I appreciated it I I loved all the visuals
the the fight at the end and I love all the the night scenes almost look like
black and white yeah except there's occasional like red glow from a fire like it's style it's stylistic but not
like uh distractingly so it's all kind of in service of telling the story yes
they ever present Icelandic volcano erupting in the background makes you feel like you're in a different time
which you are but it didn't feel like they're filming in Southern California not like a typical Hollywood like yeah I
guess mentioning like a Braveheart type movie where it feels phony these are actors in costumes yeah there were
moments where it felt like that and then there are moments where it felt really authentic
uh and um like oh God it just it's one of those movies where you're like living
back then was just been awful well yeah I appreciate the just like the bluntness of all the brutality there's that for
once he's grown up is it Alexander or Skarsgard right and they're attacking that Village it's just like this ongoing
long shot of them just murdering people and just yeah it's so it's not stylized
it's not like glorifying it it's just very like blunt and brutal you know and it's it's shocking and it's uh
disturbing but it doesn't dwell on that stuff either right that's just that's just a part of this world yeah and I
think the people that watch something like this are looking for something like a Braveheart where you you have this
really likable hero character and you know blah blah blah and that's not what
this is no not who Robert Eggers is he's gonna make something weird and disturbing but and that's why the
casting of Nicole Kidman stuck out like a sore thumb and then this I I think she's great she's a good actor but yeah
if you're trying to make something historical I mean maybe that's just us being superficial but it's like you look at her and you can just tell
skarsgard's famous uh but he Blends into his role uh Anna Anya Taylor Joy also well known
but works great as a Icelandic witch peasant uh but Nicole Kidman Nicole
Kidman kind of looks like made Marion with the hair and yeah makeup she's got
makeup on and Willem Dafoe was made to be in movies like this
of course and then you know Ethan Hawke looks like a wreck and and you know
that's great that's what they should look like I always like when they uh when they try to make movies more
historically accurate by painting teeth people's teeth all rotted I always like
that yeah that's a big standout too skarsgard's teeth were too nice
but yeah he's all rotten them no one brushed their teeth in 850 A.D
also her she plays skarsgard's mother
when he's like 10 mm-hmm and then flash forwards Skarsgard is
like 48 years old in real life yeah probably playing younger in the movie maybe it would have to be because in
real life if there's like less than 10 years different in age between those two isn't there yeah but Nicole Kidman's
playing his mother when he's grown up Alexander Skarsgard yeah so she kind of
looks the same after almost 35 years yeah
and in real life Nicole Kidman is only about 10 years older than Skarsgard Anya
Taylor Joy 20 years his Junior oh she's
in 96 he's 76. Nicole Kidman I believe is 67.
talking about their birth years not their ages so and it's funny because she plays his
mother looks the same that she did 30 years ago when he was 10. they have a weird like
at a like the reviews at a pool moment where they kiss as mother and son
uh but it's funny because in a different show that show with Reese Witherspoon
and uh Adam Scott um big Little Liars oh yeah it's called
Skarsgard and Nicole Kidman her husband and wife oh interesting
so in this they play mother and son but in a different show they played husband and wife
Nicole Kidman must be okay with that but like I would have made her
I would have put some old age something a little bit of something or you could
almost get away with just casting an older actress at that point wrinkly 85 years old yeah life was hard back then
you you know yeah this is the kind of thing I went 20. this is the kind of thing that wouldn't stick out in a more
like a Braveheart type movie you want to think about it as much but something that is more focused on details yes it
does seem a little weird a real gross disgusting
Icelandic filthy Viking movie his mother would
have been a hobbling old 96 year old woman she might have been 60. but she probably
would have looked 90. and had one foot in the grave and died instantly when he
pushed her down yeah but it's Nicole Kidman and it felt that
part felt a little too Hollywood again is that the compromise with working with the studio I don't know
yeah they all felt like they were in different movies you know when you when you strip it down
it's uh it's a wonderfully brutal
beautiful yeah Ugly movie that's a good way but it's not forever
my only real complaints and I don't even know what else you would do is you get to the end which is what the whole
thing's been leading up to when you have your final confrontation they're fighting inside like a volcano and it's
awesome looking um but the conclusion to that fight happens and you're like oh
but what else do you do with it yeah you know it's like we concluded that there's no
twists which obviously there wouldn't be and that kind of goes along with just the straightforward brutal nature of
everything in the world the movie takes place in but it does kind of leave you like oh okay that's the end yeah a
little bit I suppose the a better more modern Hollywood comparison would be
Gladiator oh
laughs
foreign
I want to put a little asterisk next to this movie you will wholeheartedly recommend it I would I would too
um but not to the one star reviewers well hopefully the people that watch us
are not the one star reviewers yeah yeah I just fear I'm going to read um in like
variety or something in a couple days that Robert Eggers is directing the next Disney plus Marvel show and then all
hope and Humanity will be lost he's managed to avoid that type of stuff
I hope that continues whatever size budget he gets take a step back
you know maybe I'll make a movie that makes a bunch of money yeah that's the way to go sure
I I think it'll leak out a uh uh it'll it'll even out over time yeah
it's gonna stick around for a while I think this is one because people are still talking about it it came out like a month or two ago in theaters and now
it's on our streaming now it's on streaming pretty quick yeah so I think for for people that are into movies like
it something like this still getting made today is so unique that it's worth seeing just for that alone and it's a
good movie on top of that so check it out
hey it's me again I'd like to order
another beer maybe something malty yeah whatever you want to pick is fine
just make sure it's cold okay yeah you got my time spatial coordinates yeah all
right all right 30 seconds can you make it 10.
uh I'll tip you if you make it two seconds all right all right I mean what is time
you're from the future right I hear you oh Packers win the Super Bowl
this season that's [ __ ] awesome
I'll be betting on them at the sports book
all right yeah thanks Bill all right I'll be waiting for that ice cold brew
okay talk to you soon bye
oh Jesus Christ this is some kind of joke
is that a Star Trek the Next Generation VHS yeah they sent that from the future
apparently they must still have them foreign
