half in the bag why are these frogs keep
talking about movies
you know i was watching like an old tv
show recently it was like a i think it
was a game show it was what they call a
game show i remember game shows and
there were contestants on the game show
and they were placed shoulder to
shoulder
and i thought how weird
and then the strangest thing happened
the two contestants won the game show
and they turned to each other
and they did this bizarre thing they got
close
and they they took
their arms
and the the one contestant put his arm
like this and the other contestant she
put her arm like this
their heads
were like that one was on each other's
shoulder
and it was like
i think they called it a hug this is
like one of those old cultural things
that's completely evaporated yeah it was
so weird and i said what are those
people doing
where are their masks and then i and
then i was like oh this was you know
taped like five years ago oh and then i
remembered what a hug
hug was
and what it was like to look at another
person
in their eyes closer than 11 feet away
without a mask on
anyways
welcome to our year in review and what a
year it's been
2021. i was looking it's funny it's this
is our episode 201
episode 201
doing 20 21 movies yeah we forgot our
half this isn't a real half of the bag
because we're not following our story
line well i'm wearing my shirt though
i'm not i always wear this for some
reason even when we're doing our out of
character videos
i'm wearing my big big
embarrassingly ugly packers coat because
it looks like a bath mat yeah because
she looks like a bath mat because we're
in the and that's a smells like one it
does i think it was used as a bath mat i
got it at a thrift store
i've never washed it for 50 cents but it
was worth it um but but yeah it smells
it's never been washed
and uh but it's warm but 21 20 20
whatever what 22 what i don't even know
it's still 20 20. it just keeps going
yeah 2020 still hasn't ended but this
year i don't know how many half of the
bags we did on movies probably less than
usual less than usual uh and i haven't
watched too many movies but we are here
to recap uh 2021 not just movies but tv
shows as well it was the year of as
pretty good
questions you just keep watching these
weird indie cult horror pervert movies i
watch i only have
two of those on my list just two i think
i guess it depends on your definition of
weird cult pervert movies that's true
that's true but i don't have clifford
the big red dog on my list
should we start with something we've
both seen or do you want to start with
one you've seen that i haven't let's
start with something we've both seen uh
i actually watched it last night
oh is this the new edgar wright film
no i skipped that because it was too
long
oh i started the movie at midnight okay
so i went with
saint maude oh yeah a24 pictures because
it was only 85 minutes
and the edgar wright film was two hours
and i couldn't give him that extra 25
minutes that's fair was last night in
soho good why don't you just give us a
quick little rendition of that
uh it's similar to we did baby driver
when that came out and i think we both
kind of appreciated the technical
qualities of it not so much the story
there's something about the stuff that
edgar wright has done on his own without
uh simon pegg co-writing that's missing
that kind of like that heart or that
cleverness and last night in soho is
another example of that
where it's like on a technical level
it's incredibly well made the lead
performances are great but it's just
it's missing that
it's missing something it's missing that
spark
but i'm surprised it's gotten as good of
reviews as it has because the last act
goes full brian de palma which means
it's completely over the top
you're constantly aware that you're
watching a movie and it gets kind of
ridiculous and i appreciated that okay
but uh it's it's a movie and there's
another movie on my list that we'll get
to later that also has the same problem
i think it's on your list too the
nighthouse
where
it takes a little too long to make you
aware of what you're supposed to be
curious about as far as the mystery goes
you're like okay this is moody this is
atmospheric it's technically well done
but
what am i supposed to be getting out of
it it takes just a little too long to
get to that point the middle of last
night in soho gets very repetitive
where it's because it's a girl that kind
of keeps having these these visions or
these dreams or flashbacks or whatever
you want to call them to a girl in the
60s where she sees herself as this girl
and so there's a lot of that where it's
like
in one single shot where they're going
back and forth between the two girls and
it's really well done but it goes on for
so long you're like okay but why
what is this
and then you get to that point and it's
kind of satisfying but like i said it's
missing that that kind of cleverness to
the script
that's last night in soho it's okay
it's pretty good
saint maude on the other hand
i didn't realize you were gonna watch
this i didn't even put it on my list
uh i liked it a lot we'll put it on your
list and then we can talk about it oh we
can't talk about until i physically put
it on my list yeah i'm sorry it's a rule
it's a mandate
hold on they just passed the mandate
the same mod mandate
okay yeah is it is it mod is there an e
at the end there's no e at the end
and make sure it's properly capitalized
okay all right it's on it's on my list
okay now we can talk about it okay thank
god
dear god
your presence graces the air
and soon
everyone will see but a24 has has a 99
percent quality track record
hey hey what you know saint maude what
is this you know it's got some religious
undertones going on in the trailer and
there's some kind of spookiness
it looks creepy uh it's 85 minutes
quality quality entertainment for the
family the kids are going to love it
um put it on after the bozo show they're
going to be into it no it's speaking of
bozo that's a random thing to bring up
but i just learned this uh david
arquette
the actor
owns the rights to bozo
he just bought the rights to bozo and
now he owns bozo i i hey hey man i i was
on the bozo show have we talked about
this ever i don't think we have i went
to the but i have the videotape to prove
it oh oh right billy was a great player
let's give him a big hand
i was like six years old and i went with
a neighborhood friend
and uh his mom and it was hard to get
tickets i remember that i think we a
plot you have to like apply to get
tickets or something i think we tried to
they got four tickets and they're like
you want to go to the bozos show and i
said
do i
but then it was a genuine question yeah
yeah no i went to the bozo show and i
and i
the night before i dreamt that i would
be the little boy because i would always
watch him and be like you [ __ ] up you
can't get you throw the the ping-pong
ball and you miss the first bucket you
little [ __ ] up and i'm like i'm gonna
i'm gonna throw in the last bucket i'm
gonna get all ten buckets i'm gonna get
the bike and all everything even though
it's a sham to advertise for products
i'm gonna get all those buckets how
could you [ __ ] that up
the first bucket
and then and then we got there
and uh i was seated
in the very top row
uh barely on camera
and when they did the bozo pewter
you know remember the buzzer feeder yes
they would randomly select a little
ticket stub to see who goes and plays
the bozo buckets i didn't get it
and that's when i learned that i was a
loser
was that would you say that was the
first of many disappointments in your
life oh yeah yeah that's that it was
like at that point that was just it's
been all downhill that was my moment
when i realized
i would fail at mostly everything in my
life if i the bozo pewter did not select
my number i i was done for and yeah
let's take another ping-pong ball aim
for bucket three oh that was so close
you [ __ ] up what's worse you didn't get
picked or if you had gotten picked and
you didn't get the first bucket oh i
would probably have killed myself
i would have found a tiny rope
and a very very low hanging uh
support beams okay aaron all right
anyways back to uh saint maude yeah
saint maude uh
was great first-time director rose glass
um kind of a memorable name
rose glass it sounds like a fake stage
name that's true sounds like like a like
a lounge singer's name
but she did a great job damn good uh
religious horror film yeah it's uh real
quick the is a young woman is a home
caregiver like a hospice nurse who takes
care of patients
she had some kind of traumatic
incident occur in the past
that
broke her psyche and she now thinks
she's talking to god
it's a it's fairly straightforward in
terms of the narrative um yeah she she
is
clearly delusional and it's not overly
ambiguous like some of these types of
movies can be no i think it strikes that
right balance of being kind of
atmospheric and and sort of surreal at
times but always letting you know what's
going on right right it's not trying to
tease you into the fact that uh you know
she might actually be talking to god or
some kind of saint or whatever i mean
that element exists in the film and if
you want to think that you can but
clearly it's a movie about
mental illness and
uh delusion and and trauma and two
people with very different points of
view on the world because the person she
starts to take care of is like the polar
opposite of her yeah uh but then she
goes on a little uh
little bender
uh which is the more shocking moments in
the movie
uh which is what it needed you know it
was it was kind of like chugging along
and then you're like okay but so she
um but
like i said pretty straightforward
narrative but it's it's uh i think the
direction
and the cinematography and the
atmosphere is all like brilliantly done
because it's very
it never
it never uh comes out of
her perspective you don't cut to two
other characters talking about her in in
another room it's always her
not not pov literally but it's her and
it's very like warped and disturbing
claustrophobic and
um uh
you you that's and that kind of draws
you into her own
like psyche
her own perspective of the world it's
that yeah it's that it's kind of like
that taxi driver build of where you're
constantly gonna mention the taxi driver
um or we talked about sensor earlier
this year i think i mentioned st model
we talked about that that's another one
where you're like always kind of with
the character yeah and uh yeah it's
worth it for that for just the the
technique and that and that that hard
cut right before the end credits that
perfect punctuation yeah it's uh it's
it's it's stylistic it's disturbing it
kind of sits with you
i had a similar reaction when i watched
clifford the big red dog
we'll be right back with the bozo show
after these messages
i gotta watch i'm gonna start being papa
potter cuddly at timber
i did see a movie and we'll just go
right into it now continuing the 824
train is it lamb it's lamb
this is a movie that feels like the
people that don't like those a24 slow
burn movies now i understand them
because that's what lamb was
where it's like okay it's very simple
it's very uh
slow burn
but i'm not getting anything out of it
little kids got a lamb head
don't they find a baby lamb and they're
like i would love this baby lamb it's
it's there's some backstory it's numera
pace and her husband and they live on
this farm
and uh one of their lambs gives birth to
a
lamb with a human body or a human with a
lamb head whatever you want to call it
oh and there's there's there's a vague
yeah there's no explanation for it like
lamb chop
that kids show well that's that's where
the lamb had a human attached to them
sherry lewis just yeah they were you
know like conjoined twins but no they
and they there's like some big back
story about uh new mirror pace and her
husband have lost their child so they
kind of take this new half human half
lamb thing as their new child
um the actual mother of the lamb
is constantly like outside their house
bothering them because she wants her
lamb back so numero pays shoots her so
then there's something about like
messing with nature like is it the
lamb's
uh child or
the humans can't just take the child but
it's also vague i ask myself that same
question every time i have a year old
is this my lamb
i'm gonna give birth to it later
it's not really a horror movie it's more
of a kind of family drama right with
this weird twist to it okay okay which
is fine um but i mean if that's your
building block is is the the lamb and
that and then
the characters should elevate it and
there should be but you're saying that
okay and the characters really don't
yeah okay like i said there's some vague
back story about them losing their kid
that's kind of all you really get the
lamb plot should propel those back
stories and then that's when you get
into the meat of that like a gyro
some tzatziki sauce
squirt that tzatziki sauce all over it
let's give you the sequel to lamb it's
just gonna be called gyro
we know what happens to the lamb after
the movie right
is that cannibalism
if it has a human body
i don't know
that's a question
that's a question for lamb too euro
right
i only have nine movies
and uh
a couple of them aren't even movies
i don't know but i i watched i watched
um
the most disjointed
catch-up episode woodstock 99
documentary now i kind of couldn't even
tell you if i watched that this year or
last year or the year before but i did
watch it you watched it too i watched it
yeah it was like a nightmare it was like
a nightmare it's like like a like a
nostalgia nightmare
there is a sixth sense that you develop
when you spend your life going to venues
we got off the bus and i was like
something's not right like i remember
when all this horrible [ __ ] happened
it's the prequel to saint maude
yeah oh wow
that's it was good it was well done uh
the the the damning interview with one
of the the co-founders of the thing
in all of the concerts i've seen come on
there were kids i talked to kids later
who were petrified out there and i and
i'm sorry i'm not excuse me if you have
a question can i answer your question
you want to editorialize if you'd like
to editorialize come on up and you can
demonstrate everybody
where it's like why
we only people acted like we had a
hundred rapes we only had like 10 rapes
yeah like why would you say that on
camera as if it's a good thing yeah it
was trying to downplay downplay the
rapes there was only 10 of them it's not
a big deal everybody right yeah
it was just gross it's a it was a weird
moment in pop culture
where where it's like
when they think of the late 90s i think
of that yeah everything just kind of
exploding and like pointless stupid
anger a lot of the movies coming out at
that time too are kind of reflective of
that that's sort of wanting to escape
uh uh normalcy or escape reality it's
like the matrix like the matrix or fight
club which is weird to think that fight
club's a 90s movie but it is
um american beauty
starring kevin spacey which now people
just want to escape his hotel rooms
he didn't make a christmas video this
year oh yeah threatening vaguely
threatening christmas christmas video
where somebody that accused him of uh
molestation ended up dead afterwards
that didn't happen this year
yeah that's weird why isn't more people
talking about that
four people that have accused kevin
spacey are [ __ ] dead now
should i not mention this
yeah let's move on
let's uh
cancel our corey feldman interview
yeah
where is brian singer is also yeah jay
it's a very good possibility there is a
network
of sexual abuse going on in hollywood
amidst high-level movie producers and
people with power what would give you
that idea it's just a guess i have a
movie about that
we're going completely out of order but
should i mention my movie about that
sure we're gonna do it we're gonna do it
okay
but i was just saying yes the reason why
the kevin spacey
uh
accidental
deaths
uh aren't talked about is probably
because
that's why he made those little
christmas videos those weird videos that
are understood by nobody except like a
very small
people that uh
the the
no pun intended but the house of cards
would come tumbling down on many many
many people this is all theoretical but
well sure i'm assuming that's the case
and that's why brian singer has just
vanished yeah um
because yeah the a house of cards would
collapse and there would be major
fallout and so
that that's what they call a conspiracy
and some conspiracies are actually real
most are not
uh but what what is this movie that you
watch oh it's a it's a conspiracy
related movie this is
far from the best movie i saw last year
but the most exciting it's called the
scary of 61st
can we afford this
something extremely sinister happened in
this apartment and it's a true
exploitation movie not in the sense of
like it's trying to do like a retro
grindhousey thing but just in the sense
that it's super low budget shot on 16
millimeter it's very messy the acting is
all over the place but it has a real
kind of like diy
kind of gorilla filmmaking spirit to it
and
it's taking something from current
events and exploiting it
doing it in a kind of tasteless way
it's about two girls one of them is the
co-writer and co-director they move into
an apartment building in new york
and another girl shows up knocks on
their door and explains to him hey i
think this apartment building used to
belong to jeffrey epstein
um and then it go it spirals out of
control from there one of the girls
starts to get possessed by
the spirit of one of his victims and it
gets really [ __ ] up and disturbing and
then the other girl uh goes down a
rabbit hole of conspiracy theories not
just the the epstein stuff but like they
mentioned like pizzagate like every
conspiracy theory
and so the the girl that tells them that
this used to be jeffrey epstein's
apartment kind of like makes them become
worse people it just spirals into
madness
but like i said it's shot on 16
millimeter it's very
like they actually go to
whatever epstein's like main
apartment or house in new york was where
it's got like his initials on the
outside of the building they just go
there and the girl that's possessed
starts just like masturbating on his
front steps while well touching his
initials
and it's just like it's so far gone and
like movies aren't made this way anymore
where they're this kind of like
confrontational and and uh
not concerned about
tastes
uh so it was very exciting on that level
now you got this is a video nasty that
you got from a store clerk no no it
apparently played it like i don't know
if it was sundance or played at some
film festival where's your watch out uh
it's streaming now itunes yeah you can
watch it anywhere summer of 61. the the
scary of 61st
scary of six which is a bad title
because ironically the word scary is a
funny sounding word sure it's it's like
in your face and not not like like
like trauma like trying to be offensive
like it's taken more seriously than that
but it is just like unafraid of what
anybody thinks of it and i appreciated
that well that's uh that's uh certainly
a breath of fresh air i'm gonna have to
watch this it's it's something
the important thing
is that we're awake
well i watched being the ricardos
i'm thinking about a [ __ ] movie about
lucille ball
action lucy
i'm home
i i was kind of curious about that but
i feel like uh it's nicole kidman right
she seems like a weird choice for that
because she's like 97 years old lucille
ball wasn't a spring chicken when she
started the lucy show in fact there's a
bit in the movie about that the problem
is you're really 39 aren't
you hmm
she gets uh her contract gets cancelled
because she's like 38 or something
they're like yeah you can't be in movies
anymore you're too old and she's like
what you know i don't know lucille ball
was like i don't know 40 something when
i left lucy started so it's not a
stretch okay and then that's the thing
too it's like nicole kidman as lucille
but she does a great job
uh jk simmons is in it too as uh fred
fred nethell it's not like a movie about
lucille ball's life it's it's one of
those um
i was trying to think of a good
comparison like in terms of
like a a true life
movie where it just instead of
i guess ed wood would be a good example
where it doesn't go through the entire
life of a person but it takes
discovering one thing sliver and this
covers a week okay and it's uh it's
it's interesting because they're filming
the i love lucy show and um
there's all this uh the red scares going
on the the people calling each other
communists and lucille ball and it's
she gets
she when she was younger she checked the
box on a voting form as communist
because her father was
and she didn't you know she was just
like i don't know whatever
and then it came back to haunt her and
they're like yeah and they're going to
release this news article and there's
all the stress and they're trying to do
a taping
desi's cheating you know there's all
this stuff going on
it's not something i would typically
watch but
i was just curious because i kind of
like the
biography movies that are just a little
sliver of
of time in someone's life
where it doesn't gloss over stuff yeah
it really like um
because you know you can't make a movie
a two-hour movie about some someone's
entire life you tend to
rush through things but it just took a
little sliver and i was like neat um but
the most important thing about the movie
jay
is that board nurse isn't it
all right they walk out of desi lou
studios la war's famous uh boris yes her
and uh
jk simmons there he's like come on come
on lucy let's go get a drink i got to
talk to you about some things
and uh they leave desilu desi lou
studios and across the street is
bordners they go you know it's like a
vintage famous bar and they go on board
and they're sitting in there i'm like
that's where i fought the guy in l.a
wars
somebody said
but yeah
yeah
good performances
relatively forgettable
but uh
like a solid watch
just like the tomorrow war with chris
pratt did you watch that no
no [ __ ] that that's one of those movies
there's those movies that show up on
streaming like exclusively for streaming
which the the
lucille ball movie those are amazon
yeah and they go one of two ways they
come out and they're immediately
forgotten like the tomorrow war with
chris pratt
or everybody's talking about it like uh
the the
don't look up the new one on netflix
where it's cause that kind of like i
don't know leads to a larger discussion
of
of real world things but yeah
a movie like
the tomorrow war just completely
forgotten
i have one of those on my list too
what's that look at that look at the way
over segways segwaying all over the
place more segways than
or segways i don't know malcolm
i don't know blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah when are they making
the third movie third paul blart movie
it'll be direct to netflix right oh [ __ ]
when's that happening
it happened i'll say it happened it
happened i forgot about it a bunch of
fatsos and trailer parks watched and
it's on a server somewhere next to the
tomorrow war with chris pratt
uh no but i watched this was an early
2021 movie that i recommended to you
multiple times netflix movie called bad
trip
with eric andre if you're ever in
manhattan i'll show you around great yes
great seeing you chris
i kept telling you to watch it i know
you would love it then you haven't
watched it i watched it a few nights ago
oh you did watch it yeah you idiot oh i
didn't think you [ __ ] up it's on my
list didn't you see my list i guess i'd
miss that one oh it's not on there oh
see
whoops
maybe you were having a bad trip when
you wrote your list
uh bad trip uh
you
were right to recommend it
i did not love it okay i
liked it what are you looking at
huh
that's kind of where i fall too it's
kind of like i enjoyed it but i assumed
you would get more you like those like
bad grandpa
borat hidden camera kind of formed into
a narrative movie yeah well this is
a straight-up
scene for scene remake of borat
i mean he's him and his friend are going
cross-country to find a lady i think bad
grandpa's kind of a
i haven't seen bankrupt but that's
another kind of road trip that seems
like the perfect
uh
structure for these type of movies
because you can get lots of different
little scenarios and and you could drive
through the south where people are
apparently so stupid they don't realize
they're on a hidden camera prank thing
that's what they do that's their mo sure
that's what borat did yeah borah wanted
to find pamela anderson and he brought
his uh producer friend with him and they
drove in an ice cream truck yeah eric
andre is in love with his high school
crush
she barely even knows who he is she
barely yeah and she runs an art gallery
in new york city and he's in florida so
they have to drive up from florida to
new york city and he brings along a
little little ray
the guy from he's like the security guy
and get out yeah whatever that actor's
name is um
i think they steal his sister's car yes
played by tiffany haddish sister broke
out a gale she has a ford crown vic
that's painted pink that says bad [ __ ]
on it so they steal her wacky car friend
road trip going to find a girl it's all
classic uh comedy formula stuff for this
type of movie yes um just a loose
framework to hang lots of dumb
set pieces on yeah and that's the thing
is um
i think there there's there's two
different types of hidden camera
prank stuff
and borat went for
uh a little bit of both there's there's
there's the shock
there's slapstick
and then there's like cultural stuff
borat focused more on the cultural stuff
oh yeah yeah borah is satirical this
movie is just an excuse yeah i was
trying to
say something
make a statement about american life and
uh
xenophobia and racism and
you know he's he's playing a guy from
kazakhstan who doesn't understand
american culture and that's the bit
and bad grandpa is just straight up like
ha ha it's an old man
[ __ ] in a restaurant like all over the
wall or something
on the wall
i only know that because you've told me
i haven't seen it there's a lot of like
um
uh stunts
and and wacky stuff and and bad trip had
a lot of that too but
there's lots of
like
stuff that was uncomfortable
that that was the the tiffany haddish
stuff because she's
committed to the role i would say she
does a good job in the role but it's not
funny it's more uncomfortable because
she's so
she shows up in places and keeps talking
about how she's going to kill them and
everyone just looks like like it's not
funny yes it's more just like yeah it's
awkward her parts i don't i don't know
her as a comedian i don't think i've
seen a movie with her in it i'm familiar
with her name and who she is but um i so
i can't really judge
you know whether or not she was funny in
it i for me the character and how she
played it yeah one of those are really
intense
i'm saying that i remember faces
and then there's other scenes where like
that's she's the villain in the movie so
they keeps cutting to her like kind of
on their tail yeah she breaks out of
prison
uh and she steals a cop car which i
thought was hilarious when she ripped
the door off the cop car
like like physical comedy like that yeah
that's just so like shocking they're
like what
um that's that stuff's funny to me but
there was just so much of it that ended
up being uncomfortable and then i think
of this
nightmare world that we live in
where you have a situation like that
and
i i felt like nervous even though i know
nothing happened because the movie got
released but i feel nervous for the
actors involved
like when they're
in this situation and
you never like
some weirdo could just pull a gun out
and
decide to take matters into their own
hands
you know what i mean like there were
several moments like that during the end
credits they show some of the like the
behind the scenes stuff yeah and eric
andre at one point he has a safe word
when he's walking around the bar and
he's like pissing himself bumper i'll
shower and play pool with you if you
want
i guess he don't understand no okay all
right all right goosebumps or whatever
like popcorn popcorn he's you could tell
he's just
fuming mad he's like the [ __ ]
bathroom you do things can get violent
very quickly someone could pull a gun
it was just like situations like that
and i know nothing happened but um it it
uh
that kind of uh uncomfortable humor
isn't as funny to me as the
like shock uh stuff and this one has a
lot of that too it reminded me a bit of
freddy got fingered eric andre's
character is like a traditional kind of
dumb comedy protagonist
taken up uh to the point of being
psychotic
yeah yeah yeah yeah eric andre is very
funny and the show is very funny and him
he he likes
he he's good at the physical comedy like
there's lots of smashing things on the
show and that's kind of insane
destructive slapstick and then it ends
for no real reason and a white chicks uh
homage
just cuz
yeah the plot's over we'll just do this
now well they had the videotape in our
car remember did you set it up
that's kind of the interesting thing
about these types of movies is seeing
the ways that they
try and make it work and editing to
bear resemblance to a real movie that's
kind of fun yeah and you see the bits
where it's like clearly a
uh hidden prank thing where is they're
expecting bigger reactions or something
more to happen and it doesn't really but
you got to keep the scene in right
because it's important to the plot so
it's like they just edited it down as
much as possible just to get the point
across and then they move on yeah
it's an interesting
art form craft
it's yeah it takes skill it's not
completely controlled you get what you
get
i love the shock humor
uh and i love destructive humor like
when he falls off the top of the bar
he's drunk you know
where it's and then the girl runs off to
him she's like i'm a nurse i'm a nurse
she thinks it's real and i i like stuff
like that that isn't um like ugly or
dangerous or uncomfortable yeah and only
uncomfortable in a funny way like borat
would pull off sure
um like the dinner party but yeah but
that's stuff where it's more he's he's
like a like an innocent he comes across
to people borat does like kind of an
innocent kind of idiot character as
opposed to like tiffany haddish and this
where she's so angry and confrontational
he bora would bring it'll elicit a
different reaction from people yeah
borat brings out the ugliness in people
tiffany haddish uh personified the
ugliness and brought it in yeah to a
situation with normal people
and that's that's when it it
the comedy doesn't work for me sure but
overall i had some pretty pretty good
laughs the the gorilla scene
hand in the blender
falling off the roof and the bar the
projectile vomit i mean i'm laughing now
thinking about it there's lots of good
bits in it and eric andre's good at
physical con i think just his
performance he's yeah he's just awkward
and funny oh and oh god the uh the art
gallery finale oh yeah you know just
all these pro works of art are priceless
they're valued at millions of dollars
and then of course you know
and that's that's the bit tiffany addis
was good in you know she
runs in and i'm gonna kill you and they
just instantly run to every piece of art
in there and starts smashing it takes
the painting and hits them over the head
you know you set that up with their all
priceless works of art and their
millions of dollars in value and then
they just start smashing one destruction
it feels like something that i would
make
with
my friend rich evans rich just
immediately go and fall on the priceless
works of art even though there's plenty
of room to fight elsewhere right to
start making a mess of everything
and so lots of laughs but um
the laughs were unfortunately balanced
out evenly with the uncomfortableness
i'm from these streets
i guess it was pretty good but i wanted
to mention oh now we're in movies but
we're going to jump to tv real quick
before our commercial break can we do
this can we do this can we do this i
don't know is the format is there a
mandate is there a
um yeah we can there they did approve
the governor of wisconsin
tony alvarez your your high school math
teacher
uh is
uh he gave a mandate that says we could
switch from movies to tv okay um
because i want to talk about because
we're out we're talking about eric andre
and i want to switch to another um uh
uh brilliant comedian
i cannot talk about it without crying
here we go
tim robinson the show it's a show on
netflix sketch comedy show called i
think you should leave
which was introduced to us by colin yeah
i had heard of the show before that but
i never watched it i never heard of it
when he was in town yeah they were like
watch this watch this skit because i
think we were showing them some dr steve
bruhl
i went to
marinara and learn all about brooks and
maybe you want to too otherwise why are
you even watching this show colin had
never watched check it out with dr steve
bruhl so we put on some of those then he
was like if you want to watch something
else that's funny watch i think you
should leave with tim robinson and i was
like what's that
i guess he was a writer for snl
he was on the show on camera briefly but
then he mainly did writing
i don't know yeah that was the weird
thing when we were watching it with
colin we were all like laughing
hysterically and it felt like such a
like a fresh kind of comedic voice yeah
and i was like where the [ __ ] did this
guy come from yeah he just like seemed
to come out of nowhere absolutely insane
and it's this like humor that's right up
my alley yeah
you [ __ ] suck it's like
insane ramblings like a weird dream you
had
um
but uh i i was i thought of this because
while we were talking about
uh the bad trip
there's a bit in
the funniest and saddest thing ever we
yeah he um
it starts off with like hey we're gonna
we're gonna do a prank show you know and
i'm gonna i'm gonna dress up like an old
man and it's it's clearly a nod at
the the
johnny knoxville's grandpa character
they have the montage of him getting in
the makeup and you're expecting it to
look
good like bad grandpa and it just looks
like [ __ ]
you expect yeah they set it up and
that's you know part of the brilliance
of it as they set it up is he's gonna
look it's gonna look just perfect he's
gonna look like an old man he's gonna
fool people he's gonna go to a shopping
mall and [ __ ] with people
uh
the pickup looks terrible
and he's got this body suit out that's
like muscular what's too much [ __ ]
[ __ ] on me i can't breathe they just cut
to the mall and you just they won't move
but it becomes like and that's the like
i haven't seen it's there and screams i
haven't seen as much of the show as you
have but uh that's kind of the
brilliance of it is it it does that and
that's the comedic bit but then it goes
on further to the point of being like
almost esoteric and like sad and yeah i
don't even want to be around anymore
what i don't want to be around anymore
that's what sets it out
makes it stand out to me is the the
combination of yeah doing sketch comedy
stuff but also like
uh
it'll be awkward uncomfortable humor and
then kind of segue into this sort of
like underlying sadness to almost
everything
yeah and and he he plays almost like uh
sometimes he's playing like the straight
man you know and then he'll have a
different actor or actress play his part
yeah the insane person and it's always
like
i think what what makes everything stand
out it's not like
10 actors all trying to be funny it
usually
is isolated around one character that
that just stands out and and that's what
makes me laugh is like he'll just say
something really
weird and and strange and he'll act
he'll get fixated on something i guess
he just doesn't like me no no he's just
fussy ah pride just doesn't like me
because i used to be a piece of [ __ ]
uh and it's a lot of like yeah your
normal social settings they keep cutting
to like board rooms like work meetings
it's like well what if you know he was
forced to skip lunch to go to this work
meeting well he hides the hot dog in his
sleeve
and he's eating the hot dog
um and then everyone starts freaking out
when he's choking on the hot dog and
that turns into like violence and then
it ends awkward there's a lot of
endurance humor yeah
lots of um just playing with
social norms and just him being like
just [ __ ] insane
oh my god where did this table come from
i put it there it just magically
appeared well i have a
heavy thing of coffee
it's better than putting it on the floor
i'm just right that's true for the first
part of our discussion i've been leaning
down and grabbing my coffee like
everyone thinks you're farting
uh i i have on here i care a lot
you have to come with me
and remember
i'm here to help
oh yeah i think that was another netflix
thing
and i rather enjoyed it i don't want to
talk too much about it because no one
gives a [ __ ] is peter dinklage in it yes
okay
that's all i know about it and did you
watch it like no i haven't seen it
rosamund pike rosamond
rosalind pike roseman i don't know gone
girl yeah you're confusing me and peter
dinklage
is a is uh well she's kind of a villain
her she runs a scam
where she steals uh
uh
the the identities of elderly people
or forces them
tricks them into going into a home and
then like takes control of their estate
and profits from it and peter dinklage
is on to her
uh it's a good
movie it was interesting it was a unique
concept
but uh
kind of like that peter dinklage he's
great he had some words lately
with fans that didn't like the end of
game of thrones did he say get a life he
said [ __ ] get alive from move on
oh my god i have two segways i could go
here
i could go with the uh
uh
the ending wasn't satisfying to a tv
show segway or i could go with the
elderly abuse segway
oh which one do i go with what which one
do you think i'm gonna pick
they'll both lead to talking about
things you probably don't care about
unfortunately well maybe you'll care
about one of them
i'll go with the one you maybe will care
about and that is uh jay i care a lot oh
yeah call back oh my god oh my god call
back too clever for for our own good
here
is that all you have for i care a lot i
guess yeah it's been so long since i've
seen it but i wrote it down because i
liked it okay there's some good stuff in
it
i just don't remember what that's that's
the problem with some of these movies
and we always talk about how much we
would love the death of cinema the death
of theaters
but when you watch stuff at home
sometimes it's kind of in one ear out
the other
things don't always stick i mean if it's
really really good regardless of where
you watch it it'll it'll stick but yeah
that's true when you have a
middle-of-the-road movie like
yeah my next movie is called middle of
the road oh my god that's not true don't
remember anything about it
now tell me about elderly abuse oh this
is this have to do with shooting william
shatner into space
now and for just to see if he would die
during the trip up there
oh jesus so tell me about what you saw
uh it's called the amusement park
it's a lost george romero film oh yeah
as you know i think
outside i'm going outside anyway this
there's nothing
uh and this was uh it was i heard about
it like a year and a half or two years
ago it was buried in an article about
george romero and it was like at the
very bottom of it it's like oh and we
discovered a giorgio mayor movie that's
never been released but uh the back
story is it's not really a feature film
which kind of worried me going into it
the back story is uh back in the night
of the living dead jays george romero
was an industrial filmmaker uh he was
hired by some group called the lutheran
society to make an industrial film uh
bringing people aware of elderly abuse
and so george romero used that as an
opportunity to make an hour-long
abstract
nightmare
about elderly abuse and i don't know
what happened to it after that i think
it played a couple like festivals or
something but i think they thought it
was too like scary and nightmarish to
release i think they were expecting a
more traditional industrial film
um and so it just never came out until
recently it was rediscovered and
remastered and uh
i was worried when he first started it's
got the lead actor who was the elderly
man in the georgia murray movie martin
and he's talking right to the camera
perhaps the saddest cause of denial and
rejection is very simply
old age
he's like this is a film about
elderly abuse and i was like oh it is
just kind of an industrial film like uh
uh but after that opening then it is
like a sh it's it's an hour long about
an hour long but it is a movie kind of
uh uh it doesn't have like a
conventional narrative structure but
it's not an industrial film so it kind
of falls in this weird in-between
category but it's yeah it's really
effective it's from that era of george
romero like
uh kind of martin dawn of the dead era
where he's a little experimental with
with his editing
like the scenes in uh dawn of the dead
when we're cutting back and forth
between
like the the mannequin heads and them
shopping and it it has that kind of vibe
to it i've always liked george romero as
an editor especially from that era
it just has some really effective
sequences of it's using this amusement
park as kind of a metaphor for
for
getting old and being taken advantage of
and being abused
the lead performance it's the older guy
from his movie martin and he does a
great job
uh hard to categorize thing
something that was meant to be an
industrial film that turned into a
terrifying nightmare art film he was
just too creative yeah for his own good
yeah
god bless him rip
he didn't understand the assignment as
they say i just made a george romero
movie so it's i i don't know i think
it's
exclusive on shutter the streaming
service shutter i think that's the only
way you can watch it
but it's worth seeking out especially if
you're a fan of george romero he's
always been one of my favorite
filmmakers so the idea that oh here's
almost an entire other movie that you've
never seen
there's nothing
out there i'll see for myself
bye
now you said uh disappointing endings
oh yeah that was your other that was my
other segue yeah you want me to go into
that too
talking about the tv show dexter
oh dexter new blood dexter new blood
yeah okay well
i guess this is just the mixture of
movies and tv shows nothing really
matters anymore we're breaking mandates
we're breaking those those
state of wisconsin mandates you have to
keep movies and tv separate yeah i might
still be a monster
but i'm an evolving monster
so jay tell me all about
dexter new blood i don't give
a a flying rat's ass about dexter so i
will be
leaving my body
while you talk do you like michael c
hall yeah
i like the
six feet under he's great this is he's
born to play this role and i i kind of
the first few seasons of dexter are so
great and then it kind of falls off and
everybody hated the ending i didn't hate
it as much as other people but it's not
very good and so this is like less of a
like uh
we're going to revive this thing as like
a
a cash grab and more of a we want to
end the show better than we did we had a
few years to think about it since then
so we're going to break it back
bring back a couple old characters but
mostly new characters it's in a
completely different setting clancy
brown is in it he's very intimidating uh
michael c hall's kid shows up in it not
his real son but the original series
he's just a tiny child but now he's like
a teenager
[ __ ] perfect casting for him it looks
like a little michael c hall
um so it's been good as of the the
taping of this there's one episode left
so i don't know
uh i haven't seen it i don't know if
they're gonna [ __ ] the bed and ruin it
but so far the season has been really
really solid and the character of dexter
is great
and they've done a lot to kind of redeem
him is it redeemed the series is it's
going to continue on i think the idea is
that this is a series okay i think this
is it
um i guess we'll find out with this
final episode that might be a lie
so by the time i'm editing this i'll
know how it ends so i'll just insert an
emoji here on my reaction to the ending
continued in part two
