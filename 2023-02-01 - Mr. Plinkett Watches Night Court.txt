previously on half in the back comedy on
TV it's not even funny yeah it's there's
no jokes it's everything played so safe
um you know the days of the office are
long gone yeah half in the back try to
order a pizza pie the other day then I
realized I was in a gynecologist's
office
thank you
well Mr plinkett what do you say we
watched the new Night Court reboot Night
Court what the hell is Night Court I've
never heard of that show as you both
know I'm a fan of Newhart
oh right because we're in a new timeline
I can't believe how poorly that's aged
already
what well guys let's watch the first
episode of Night Court which is
currently streaming on peacock along
with many other quality programs
why are you staring at my wall
that was a tricky
thanks for the help people are usually
scared of me for some reason why do you
have a few tattoos What's So Scary About
a flaming skull that's my Nana Oh I love
her cheekbones I hope you're not in a
rush to get to court well let me be the
first to introduce you to me I'm your
bailiff not a good gayness everyone
calls me gergs oh so nice to meet you
gergs I'm Abby Stone I just moved here
oh gerds I thought it said girth
oh no Arlo forgot his nose ring that one
in his nose
I didn't know there would be piercing
shaming piercing uh jokes weird
piercings I feel like I traveled back to
the 90s
they hired a child to do these credits
oh you're going to fry not quite 50
hours of community service
that was a bang I think I do it lightly
for people with sensitive ears
oh yeah
just move some letters around moving
letters is a huge deal ask Vanna White
legal aid said they'll send another
script sitting in a drawer since 1994.
94.
that would make the night just walk
no it was
oh it's over thank god
um Mr Fielding building
but if I was that door slam I'd really
hurt my feelings so I guess I'd have the
support of a nurturing Community who
would help rebuild my self-confidence
and set me on an empowered path of
Discovery and self-acceptance who are
you and why are you still talking
that is what sold Sarah on the place
Sarah your wife
she was
foreign
you found him in a pool hall and helped
him go back to the thing that he loved
you said you admired him
for the road what
else do they came from these cows have
seen stuff what happened please you're
the only person I know who gets how that
world works
at least the only person who's still
around
all right they rebooted a show where
everybody's dead hooked up buddy
so no as I said
self-centered narcissists aren't public
defenders we're prosecutors when do the
joke start yeah I know these people
they're supposed to be jokes
oh wait am I dying in only the most
irrelevant parts of my life I thought
this was a drama
it is depressing
look I appreciate you I'm glad Todd
salons went into television
I think you could Thrive here don't you
want that for yourself this is as funny
as gummo
your past your feelings you've put your
whole life in a box and won't let anyone
in well hold on a second am I in the Box
am I putting things in the Box I kind of
lost the thread the feeling is
lovely meeting why does she need him so
bad because he was on the old show yeah
because he's not dead there's no other
public defenders they are qualified well
none that we're on the original show
it's very important
this work and I came up with Jack
Diddley squat which incidentally is a
name on the board this guy the Beast
story is her trying to figure out who's
rearranging the letters
hilarious solid B story for the first
episode of your new series
this is like a season 7 B story
afraid to open a box
why'd they laugh so much at that
oh that's not real people serves an
awkward silence there right down to the
guy fishing dead birds out of the
ceiling
afraid to open a box
ask me something
say a lifetime ago you worked with a guy
the job ends you go your Separate Ways
life happens and you live and you love
what's the punchline going to be here
the guy doesn't speak English
not too racist oh they won't do that
anymore yeah
you can't be deaf deaf either now what's
the punch line it asks for your help
did you take the chance
would you
open that heart up again
let feelings in knowing that
undoubtedly I hope this goes on so much
longer not speaking English is a good
there is a saying oh my country
when men is holding dead bird
tell shorter story
foreign
and it's okay to make fun of Russians
right now sure he just said tell a
shorter story
stay out hurry I missed the joke
a box is full of snakes
you're right I definitely missed jokes
your honor Dan Fielding for the defense
he's back Mr blanket he's back
I didn't think it would happen
if you keep smiling like that I'm out of
here right now so just knock it off
better better your honor
I'm already regretting this that was an
outtake
Mr Gates was brought in for loot conduct
obviously this man is a depraved Menace
and has no place in decent Society
building I'd just like to remind you
who are the defense
your honor oh it's over
in such a hurry to get out I'm just
gonna do this isn't it
community and we are always ready for it
he's waiting
people indulge me I just
why did she say it like that
so that could happen
could that even mean anything else the
way she said that no
well that's a lie
I guess it's time to wait around for
that new heart reboot
