half in the bag
and we're back
to talk more about movies and tv shows
2020 money
but in reality we're filming this bit at
the end after we've been talking for
three hours yeah and we're done and our
brains no longer work so now through the
magic of editing we'll cut back to two
and a half hours ago
into the conversation all right say
right
a quiet place too
this was a pandemic movie that kept
getting delayed right
shot in 2019 supposed to be released in
[ __ ] april 2020 sometimes something
like that
the theater is going to reopen
they always talk about like the move
like uh
the movies that's going to bring people
back to the theater it wasn't
christopher nolan
it ended up being [ __ ] spider-man
apparently but
this is one of those movies where it's
like this is a theatrical experience we
got to keep holding off until theaters
reopen and then you see it and aside
from the opening which was awesome
uh it's the most uncinematic thing ever
and it's the same movie as the first one
it felt like like two episodes of a tv
show yeah it was like lost like here's
the episode where they try and find a
boat
here's the episode where they go to an
island and find some other people
it was so
yeah it was it just yeah
more of the same but
no real stakes or emotional connection
the way the first one had with the
family unit and the dad and john kraske
died in the first one so they replaced
him
with somebody else killian murphy yeah
and then uh and then the things come and
then whatever and then the ending was
the same too yeah something where the
little kids try to turn on a thing yeah
they make noise and they stop the
monsters again the opening was pretty
great though it was like a flashback to
the the initial invasion and it was
really well shot
yeah lots of long takes
yeah sure i was like hey this is gonna
be pretty good and then after that it
just feels like a boring episode of a tv
show yeah not horrible by any means
watchable i guess but
it's better than
getting tricked into watching some crap
movie
that's you know that's like a low budget
crap
sure you know what i mean like
what was it i sent you a text i have i
have that uh voodoo or whatever yeah um
and uh
vuru has all the movies here and there
and then they have that little thing
that says in theaters
oh yeah you sent me some animated thing
no no no it was uh
hold on
oh mega boa
oh with eric roberts eric roberts yeah
uh and then it has a little in theaters
thing and you know that's that one of
them junk movies
mega boa they go to those bruce willis
movies so they try and trick you right
it's a real movie bruce willis is in it
right bruce willis is in it for five
minutes of screen time yeah
and anytime it's the back of his head
it's a stand-in yes and he shows up for
two days of filming and gets 90 of the
budget not jack
with the girl
who is this but at least those movies
don't say in theaters this is this is
new to me yeah a complete junk movie
that they're trying to say is in
theaters even though there's no way it
is
i'm wondering if they just put it in one
theater
to
you know
just so they can say that yeah i'm
wondering if that's a trick because i
you know i have a
a sharper eye for crap detection than
maybe your average viewer and i'm like
that's that's a junk movie you know in
the posters like all
you know you know what it is oh yeah you
know it's a
i don't know what's what's some of those
trash come gravitas ventures you know
those trash companies
have you seen that one yeah uncorked
media or whatever red arrow they just
put out anything yeah yeah yeah and and
you know it's like it's shot on it looks
like a decent camera but it's probably
an iphone 12
or someone's home dslr camera
and it looks like a real movie sort of
but you know it looks kind of fake and
it looks junky and there's no real stars
in it
and uh it's crap
but i'm wondering if mega boa
did play in one theater and that
qualifies it to get the in theaters tag
on it maybe it played in eric roberts
home theater
well let's segue
what are you doing let's late segway
okay from your elderly abuse video
a little film called old neil breen's
latest opus from the hotel they're so
rusted what's happening found stuff from
the hotel in the sand
this is the movie that really solidified
for me
uh because people always talk about i'm
nice shyamalan he had a couple decent
movies uh recently
with like split and uh
the visit was okay yeah it seemed like
he left his pretensions at the door he's
like [ __ ] it i'm just gonna make i'm not
gonna try and like prop these up as
anything more than they are they're
silly little twilight zone movies
and i guess this old kind of falls into
that category but
dialogue is so bad even for rem night
um and it
it's the first time i've noticed it
where it's like it sounds like a neil
breen movie the dog has died oh my god
oh my god
i was only just alive then we can be
friends
you can come over to my house and make
up stories
then we can go to the same college
together
and become neighbors with mortgages
glad to have our personal lives to rely
on
no secrets here
you know i can't talk about my work
i can't reveal secrets if neil breen had
a real budget and cast real actors
and directed them because that's another
thing this movie has like professional
actors in it but it's like career worst
performances by a lot of these people
to me it was more the performances and
less the dialogue okay there's some
weird ass dialogue in it
what are your names and what do you do
for a living i i
i liked the movie
a lot
um i liked it as
it fall it's kind of an unintentional
comedy but not completely
it's very weird it's it kind of like
doesn't fit in any category no and but
it was
i think the premise wasn't his it was
based on a short story
that or like a comic or something yeah
so
that's the interesting part to me was
the premise
uh which he didn't come up with but um
the first
half of the movie i
i really kind of liked because i think i
just like those um
that situation i like the uh i like the
premise and i liked uh the idea of all
these different characters they're
trapped on this beach
and there's a problem and they they
slowly start to figure out what's going
on and every little thing
um every little gimmick that you can do
with uh people aging rapidly
is done sure uh and i guess decomposing
rapidly too right don't they
turn to bones there's a one girl with
like the spinal problem well that that
was the part what i was laughing
hysterically at she has uh like a
calcium deficiency yeah yeah yeah she's
like a supermodel and she mentions at
the beginning of the movie she looks
right at the camera and says i have a
calcium deficiency good morning what
would you like for a breakfast
i'll have the calcium bomb juice drink i
have a calcium deficiency
so that she's like like she turns into
like this old hag in the cave and she
holds up a rock and accidentally drops
it on herself
turns into a pretzel and it's hilarious
yes but but you have the the the two
lead actors they have like accents
um which
gives it this unintentionally funny
i'm sorry well it has that quality like
when we watch the best the worst movie
where it's trying to be in america like
you're watching an italian it feels like
that even though it's that's not the
case yes and and that was like odd oddly
an odd choice
unless it was an international movie you
know from somewhere else but finance
somewhere who knows i don't know but or
who those actors were but they have
accents and you know that's fine that's
someone has an accent but it
it comes off as like that bad low-budget
movie acting and then that one guy from
lost
what's his oh yeah that guy's
performance is like oh my
we god to get the resort people before
they leave i think we will all have to
leave this beach wait
why they left already
what happened he says his name like 50
times and now i can't think of it thank
you doctor it's jaren by the way and
he's like and i'm a nurse and i'm going
to do this thing
and i like i like movies where
characters are thrown into like a
nightmare situation they have to problem
solve yeah it's very like
star trek ish and then there's a weird
science fiction element to it where they
they realize they're in this danger
there's there's
there's an element that's uh not really
a ticking clock element but there's
something that's
you know
threatening them yeah and they have to
figure out a way out so they try to like
what if we walk really slowly through
you know they're they're trying to
figure out and then eventually they just
give up
and then
the one guy has an illness and it
progresses rapidly it's like an
infection i think yeah the little girl
grows up and gets pregnant and they have
a baby and they they can't which that's
[ __ ] weird
yeah
so every element of um
every gimmick that you could pull out of
it is played it but it's
the acting is so [ __ ] bad yeah
that uh it really stands out and you
have to credit it to the director i
guess
yeah because these people have all been
in other things where they're good and
then there's that one scene where yeah
it's a twilight zone-ish where
you get this reveal at the end and uh
the reveal is clunky because of this
beach
we have been able to save hundreds of
thousands of lives with new medicines
where the guy gives the speech he's like
we've discovered a cure for this oh yeah
and it wouldn't have happened if we
didn't have this magical beach
and every tourist group that we sucker
into coming on this beach and this
explains things that everyone in that
room would already know they would
already know and it's very b-movie yeah
and uh so i like the elements of it of
it being a b movie and the premise
uh it it just had so many elements that
were clunky and that a normal audience
member would just be like what and laugh
at
i it's it's something about that that m
night shyamalan where it's just he's
a completely unique voice and it doesn't
always work but it's always
awkward and weird sometimes in a good
way sometimes in a bad way yeah um
but god bless him for continuing to do
what he does
another hulu thing i watched a movie
that was made for hulu called false
positive that i thought was a joke
i don't i don't think it's mommy brain
i think doctrinal did
something i thought the movie was a joke
well that's a good sign um
i don't think it was intentionally i'm
so i was so baffled by this movie
it's uh starring and written by one of
the ladies from the show broad city
who's a comedy person
alana glazer i think her name is and
it's directed by john lee who directed
pee-wee's big holiday for netflix and he
did wonder shows in hi can you just look
in the camera and say please don't show
me yeah look in the camera and say no no
the amazing series wonder shows and if
you remember that so all comedy people
but it's like this serious rosemary's
baby ripoff
and it's so awkward and it's shot like a
like a like a lifetime movie like just
flat even lighting but it's supposed to
be this thing where she's like concerned
about her baby and and it's exactly
rosemary's baby okay but it looks like a
lifetime movie so it's more of an
oregano's baby
like
so yeah that's comedy right that's
comedy that's what they should have
called it yeah
but there was a lifetime movie a few
years ago that was because you know
those lifetime movies they all follow
like the same formula
but there was one that was exactly it
was a normal lifetime movie except it
starred will ferrell and kristen wiig
yes i heard of that and that was the
only like there was no winking there was
no jokes the only joke was the the fact
that it was made starring those two and
so i was wondering if that was supposed
to be the case with this movie but i
don't think it is i think it was meant
to be a legit horror movie but they for
whatever reason they shot it like a
toothpaste commercial
it's so weird okay fair enough that's a
hulu movie
is it under the banner of like the
blumhouse garbage no i don't think
they're doing that anymore the into the
dark series they moved to
now amazon is doing something with
blumhouse it's like called welcome to
the blumhouse i think it's the same
thing though where they make these
cheapo [ __ ] movies
but it did feel like that it felt like
one of those into the dark blumhouse
movies well i'm glad you recommended the
worst movie you've ever seen
you mentioned will ferrell being in a
fake lifetime movie
let's talk about the shrink next door
are you marty yeah what brings you here
i don't know
phyllis made me come my sister huh she
must be very persuasive it's on apple
plus one of the only things on apple
plus that i've seen every time i see
anything from apple tv plus like a
trailer or whatever it always looks like
it's fake
it looks like when you'd watch a movie
and there's like a fake tv show in the
movie that's what all the apple tv plus
stuff looks like to me yeah something
about it feels off like it's made by
aliens or something uh shrink next door
uh i have things to say about it it was
interesting oh this is will ferrell
that's the connection okay yeah yeah
yeah will ferrell
i've seen something about paul rudd
plays a therapist okay they're in new
york city in the 1980s this is based on
a true story
will ferrell and they're they're both
jewish guys
they're both
terrible
in it like performances yes but it's
paul rudd isn't terrible in anything so
they both come off like they're doing
like woody allen impressions oh
and it's really like bad it's like an
snl skit thea either you're growing or
i'm shrinking
hey it's making tony's right wednesday
night i'm calling you and they do old
old makeup too because it takes place
over like 30 years wow they're all
jews
in new york city so they all sound like
woody okay the hard part's over now it's
time to enjoy yourself oh i know i just
his sister is played by katherine hahn
catherine han is great
in everything that she's in but she's
she's really good in this she plays a
sister and she's like you know oh yeah
oh god you're so you're so neurotic
you're like woody yell and he's i know i
know
and uh is this a series of people doing
woody allen impressions uh will
ferrell's no i'm so nervous and and
she's like go see this therapist okay um
played by paul rudd and paul rudd in
i don't know if this is his only role
where he's ever played a villain
but um
he is he instantly recognizes that he
can scam this guy
and throughout the course of of 30 years
he scams him and other people
out of their money okay um very slowly
and methodically
pretending to be his friend and his
therapist and just
slowly over time like gaslighting him
into thinking like they're friends
and that he needs to invest money in
this and and do all these things to
improve his life um and he sees him as a
mark and it's just like the longest con
ever and to the end where he
will ferrell's character becomes like
like estranged from his family he
doesn't talk to his sister for 25 years
oh my god is it a comedy
dark comedy it's a dark i would describe
it as a dark comedy okay um
there's nothing really like funny about
it
and it's shot
like a comedy
wow
it's it's
but it's a you know it was based on a
podcast like a true not not true crime
but
something like some sort of podcast and
a a barely
survivable apple plus show
most most apple plus shows are
underwater well it sounds like kind of
came to the surface a little okay it
sounds kind of like when you talk about
like will ferrell being sort of
oblivious in it it's like kind of like
when you cast like adam sandler and
punch drunk glove or something where
they're
basically playing the same type of
character they always do but it's in a
different context it kind of sounds like
that
okay so yeah that's a good analogy that
actually makes me curious to watch it
yeah
i don't know it was an interesting
little story but it could have been much
much
much
much shorter feels good doesn't it
yeah
what else jay could be shorter
oh i saw a film
called the empty man
that's two and a half hours long and it
could be much much shorter
hey wait we gotta try it
try what
calling the empty man
i i think we've i don't even know if
we've mentioned on the show but i think
we've talked about it before where it's
like you see that poster the empty man
and you watch the trailer and it looks
like a slenderman type thing yeah yeah
and that's not what it is at all okay
it's one of the more fascinating movies
in recent years because it was
the last movie produced by fox before
they were bought out by disney
so it was made by fox but then disney
bought them out and disney looked at
this thing and it's this really like
creative
very messy
movie
really well made by first time filmmaker
and disney looked at it and they're like
what the [ __ ] do we do with this so they
just kind of dumped it onto streaming
and there's not even they never even
made like a physical release of it
there's no like blu-ray or anything
um
but it's not a slenderman type movie at
all but you watch the trailer and it
shows like teenagers on a bridge and
they're like we gotta call the slender
man
and on day one he
he lets you know he's there day two he
comes for you or whatever they say
and so you're like oh it's one of those
type of movies but that's just like a
part of it it's really ambitious and
every 20 30 minutes it becomes a
different movie the opening 20 minutes
20 minutes is like a perfect short film
on its own and then it becomes the
slenderman type movie with these
teenagers and then it kind of becomes
like this
procedural with this guy investigating
this missing girl and it turns into like
a movie about a cult it's based on like
a graphic novel or something but but
it's just
it's very messy at times it doesn't make
sense but it's so ambitious and so well
made and there's sequences in it that
are so good there's like a like a whole
sequence in the movie where the main guy
goes to this uh what he thinks is an
abandoned camp and he's trying to get
clues about this missing girl and he
discovers this cult there and the cult
starts chasing him and it's really tense
and really well done so it's kind of a
movie that just got dumped and nobody
has seen it but it's really it's worth
watching
it's just it's too long okay so i don't
know if you're totally selling me on it
but
maybe i won't watch it okay
speaking of things you shouldn't watch i
also watched a film called mainstream
starring andrew garfield oh god you
watched that this movie
is a pile of crap
yo what's up thanks for checking out
this video my little niece worships
these guys who do and say nothing yo why
is my existence so lit and promote a
lifestyle of doing and saying nothing is
that where he's the owner of twitter or
something it's it's it's trying to be a
movie it's made by a coppola there's
another coppola it's giacopola
and it's it's trying to be like network
the movie network which was satirical in
the 70s it's trying to be that for the
youtube generation and it feels
so out of touch
and so
bafflingly uh uh incorrect about
everything related to like social media
and it treats youtube like
like like tv where they talk about like
your viewership and your subscribers
like it's ratings it's like our
subscribers are going down um just spit
it out
we're down about 15 since the last
episode if you don't do something you
will lose more it's science and it's
like i mean youtube channels do lose
subscribers over time but there's not
like a mass exodus like like it would be
with like youtube with like tv ratings
do they say what are nielsen ratings no
no they don't do that but it's jason
schwartzman because he's related to
those coppolas he's in it and he's the
one that's kind of like sleazy producer
guy
and andrew garfield is kind of like the
uh
i'm mad as hell and i'm not gonna take
it anymore
you know character from network
or he's just he's speaking the truth and
they put a camera on him he's a crazy
person it's it's network but for youtube
but they don't understand how youtube
works and it also has one of the most
baffling incorrect
editing mistakes i've ever seen in a
mainstream movie
i don't know i don't know how this
happened and it's hard to just explain i
have to kind of just show it but they
just flat out have the wrong shot in the
movie
what are you doing but she goes she goes
on to this alley where he's at and he's
like looking at a newspaper and she's at
the other end of the alley
newspaper he's looking at a newspaper
he's doing like a comedy thing i don't
remember exactly okay but she's at the
other end of the alley and then it cuts
to a close-up of him
and
he says something but it's like he's
saying it's not the shot it's the wrong
shot because she's right next to him and
then it cuts to another shot and you see
her running up to him and it's like they
put the shots in the wrong order i'm not
sure how to explain this without just
showing visual evidence of it okay but
it's completely incorrect i understand
what you're saying but yeah yeah
it was so weird i've never seen it's not
even like
you know like martin scorsese will have
continuity errors right but it works in
the flow of the story this is just it's
flat out the incorrect shot in the movie
it's so bizarre i've never seen that
happen before in like a
any movie
i was gonna say in a mainstream movie
but any movie yeah
well i mean sometimes they'll like they
you know you're missing a close-up or
something so you use an earlier take but
something like that it's just like
wrong it's just completely incorrect
yeah wow and the movie's bad
our subscribers are plummeting
so stupid
do they ever get demonetized
no because they don't understand what
youtube is they just think it's tv
you've been age restricted oh god
there's something in your video that's
age restricting we don't know what we're
not going to tell you what it is
somewhere in your hour long video i
[ __ ] find it and deal with it
we can't help you sorry
i'm a robotic algorithm that's that's
the realities of of working on youtube
it's stuff like that
you should make a movie like that jay
where you're just like clicking how
[ __ ] up i'm gonna upload a new version
of the video and see if this one doesn't
get auto flagged
so exciting the subscribers are going
down
well i saw a movie called how it ends
did you watch this no i saw the trailer
and it looked a little too uh
cutesy a little too uh
precious
2 a.m asteroid hits oh god this is all a
big hoax you actually believe the news
the meteor is fake
uh she's like walking around with like
her child version of herself
it's like we want to make a movie and
during the pandemic okay and it's in l.a
and it's some woman
who's i don't know who she is a comedian
maybe i don't know she's she made the
film
and there's lots of guest stars in it
uh but they're all like
50 feet apart from each other okay it's
actually a terrible movie i don't know
why i'm talking about it i didn't really
like it it's just i i've seen so few
movies this year yeah but uh
it's actually a terrible movie am i
right is it too is it like really
kind of twee and precious
well the premise is not there's no
pandemic it's there's a meteorite going
to crash into earth in like 24 hours
and so that was their premise and the
idea was that the girl
is
her imaginary
younger self with her
you know and so she's just walking
around
trying to go somewhere
and
uh filming um like not in real life
filming the movie and it's like all
ad-libbed okay and none of it works
like fred armisen's in it hey try to
remember me like this
no no it's a joke that's not how you'll
die no no no you'll wait to explode like
the rest of us yeah okay good okay
hi guys nice to meet you bye they're
like ad-libbing and then she walks
here and there and everyone's standing
like one of those movies yeah from one
character to the next indie movie where
character wanders around from one person
to another that's it yeah that's it in a
nutshell i can see the whole movie in my
head yeah yeah so you don't need to
watch it that's great moving on
hello
hi hey hi hello hi hey
hey hi baby hey hey eliza hi hey hey hey
you
hi
oh hi hi hi i'm john i stole your car
bye bye guys bye bye bye bye bye
see you soon bye elizabeth
it's like an existential scavenger hunt
for your soul
real quick the nighthouse
through the open doors
the harmless phantoms all their errands
glide
the nighthouse i liked it it was pretty
good
i was kind of disappointed at the end i
think that's like going back to last
night in soho where it was like it takes
way too long for you to know what you're
supposed to be scared of or what you're
supposed to be invested in as far as the
mystery goes i feel that way about the
nighthouse but it's carried a long way
by rebecca hull her performance in it is
fantastic yeah uh
i'll be honest with you
i started to get a little sleepy at the
end
and i i it's kind of like a weird dream
of how it ended well that's the movie i
mean the movie is very dreamlike so uh
what she's like a teacher or something
he
he leaves some clues around
he
he was
building a different house a duplicate
and um
somebody
was the devil
the devil coming together a different
house yeah
i mean that's what happens at the movies
yeah i don't remember anything and then
the end that it ended
i fell asleep
i just fell down on the ground and slept
i didn't even
walk into my bedroom i just fell down
ah [ __ ] it i'm done
i'm
out uh the nighthouse everybody hey
that's what these ketchup videos are for
was it good it was good yeah move on
that's another is pretty good i guess
i started to fall asleep during the end
and then i stood up and fell down i fell
asleep on the floor
because i physically couldn't move
the night house
one star
whatever or five maybe or five i don't
know something about devils and houses
and murder and suicide and evil
in a spookiness well i i thought it was
very good i just thought it took too
long to start giving you information
yeah a lot of moody atmospheric stuff
early on a little too far before they
started introducing
more story elements oh
[ __ ] it i'm done
the nighthouse
i saw the french dispatch
oh god wes anderson's new film oh my god
what is that reaction you know i love uh
i love wes anderson movies but when i
saw the trailer for that i was like
nope every why what about it because
because it looks like a wes anderson it
looked like a wes anderson movie on
crack it began as a holiday
eager to escape a bright future on the
great plains arthur howitzer jr
transformed the series of travelogue
columns into the french dispatch
and i was like no i feel like that's
what everybody says about every new wes
anderson movie
people say it looks like a parody of wes
anderson movies all that means
and i maybe i've said in the past i
don't even know but all it means is that
he has a distinct style in all of his
movies
has a distinct style is the
understatement of
of the century and that's fine i mean i
i agree with that
but
there's something about having a
distinct style and making the same
[ __ ] movie over and over again which
which to me i didn't see it
it could be great i've liked all of his
movies but but this this is like
not one of his better movies but it's
fine yeah it's enjoyable like like
it's it's it feels lighter even though
there's dark because this movie's always
have kind of darker undertones right and
this does too but it's it's an anthology
it's basically three kind of short
stories
and so you don't have as much time to
latch on to anything that's happening in
it and it's under the framework of the
french dispatch it's like this magazine
right right so those are three stories
that were written for the magazine
um first one is benicio del toro is in a
prison he's a he's a painter he's an
artist there's some fun kind of
commentary on the art world
i like that story a lot the middle one
is timothy chalme and that's kind of
forgettable something with bill murray
well he's in the wraparound stuff he
works at the the paper
but uh francis mcdormand francis
mcdormand's in it yeah timothy chalmers
sleeping with her wait wait
is owen wilson in it
everybody's in it
is jason schwartzman in it this does
push uh because he he's kind of i like
his earlier movies better because they
still feel like one foot is in reality
yeah yeah the longer he's gone on the
more intentionally artificial they've
all kind of felt which has its term too
but this one pushes it
the furthest of any of his movies you
know the movie i really liked his was
that train movie no one ever talks about
that training uh oh uh they're jailing
limited darjeeling limited that was
great it's like three brothers are
trying to find their mother yeah and
that that had really strong characters
it just felt like it wasn't like
to wes anderson
well it was but it it still it had that
i mean all of his movies have kind of an
emotional connection
but this one really pushed the the
visual style where like it it felt like
uh
like a stage play i mean there's parts
where you see like the set break apart
as the camera goes in
so it's like you may be pushing it too
far for for people but then it'll also
have like super sophomoric you know
slapstick occasionally the dangerous
accidents the constant traffic
it is like
middle of the road wes anderson which is
still watchable and
enjoyable yeah i mean i get it he has a
very very very distinct style i i
all of his movies are smart they're good
uh i think like
you know i was like
i'm
done
i loved it
but i'm done yeah like i've i've got it
i've seen enough i'm happy
you know i can go back and watch life
aquatic or
a lot of the really good ones but it's
like
make a marvel movie now wes anderson
just do something different i would like
to see him do something drastically
different yeah like like
i i can't i'm not gonna be that couch
potato that tells an artist what to do
but you know
go
make ant-man and the wasp part two like
do something like really challenging and
don't
it's or
keep your style but put it in a
different
type of movie i don't know yeah like
i'm trying to think
there there are directors that go
outside of their comfort zone and try
something different and wes anderson
doesn't seem to do that and that's why
when i watched the trailer for the
french dispatch i was like oh my god no
well it kind of it's one of those where
it's like oh i've already seen this
movie in my head right it's it's an it's
you know it's a decent movie but it does
have that like
i feel like i've already seen it i'm not
i don't want to uh i don't know in a way
it's kind of he's kind of his movies are
sort of like marvel movies
where now they're they're so like well
i'm sure it's good but i've already seen
it
right the like the spiders he's like the
art house marvel movies don't cry in my
office
you know what's funny about i was i was
going to mention this
remember
boa stricter or whatever with
eric roberts yeah um like
when that that new spider-man movie came
out
uh
far
see this is this is my point far from
home that was the last one okay home
sweet home home alone home sweet home
alone what's the new one called home
home again home
what is it called i legit don't know
okay but
it's something home so voodoo well the
day that [ __ ] new spider-man movie
came out voodoo puts the the last
spider-man movie up
for rent you know yeah and the posters
look
all the same yeah they all look the same
and they all have home in the title and
so it's like a trick like oh the new
spider-man rent
wait a minute we've seen this all you
know and so it's like
like a trick
no way home
that's what it's called
that's a weird motif too they're all
going to have home in the title like why
is that your gimmick for the spider-man
movies it's really weird yeah it is
weird and it's confusing
and so that's that that's what makes me
like i'm just like
i don't know i and now you look at
posters for wes anderson movies and it's
kind of the same reaction exactly yeah
that's that's kind of the point i'm
making is like
i don't know
i i uh
i skipped the last two spider-man movies
same with all those marvel tv series i'm
dumb done
uh someone posted a clip of that new
boba fett show on the
on the internet on twitter no and it was
it was embarrassing
it was uh
uh that actor
tamu morrison the boba fett guy yeah
yeah who played jango fett yeah but now
he's playing yeah now he's playing boba
fett and and i argued that uh it should
have been young boba fett logan
he should be both but they
have tamir morrison as because he's the
clone so he looks like bo but he's like
he's old and fat he's yeah he's boba
fett was a skinny ass guy in in empire
strikes and boba fett and this is he's
like
like 300 pounds and he doesn't look
anything like boba fett and
and there's this action scene they
posted these guys have these like laser
shields and they're like like attacking
them and he's like
and it's like really slow and awkward
and they're like this looks like crap
that's when i was like i'm done with all
this stuff on the second season of
mandalorian which you didn't even watch
that right the second season what's the
mandalorian oh it's tv show that's star
wars
uh the second season but but he's in
that too that was the second season when
when luke skywalker shows up at the end
right yeah i didn't watch any of the
second season um but he's in but boba
fett's in that too because that entire
season was just a setup for
future disney plush shows basically yeah
but uh there's an episode where
he's just dressed normally but then he
puts on the boba fett armor and there's
an action scene but he's old and fat
he's wearing the armor and he looks
silly oh i thought was scrawny jeremy
bollix was scrawny the skinny skinny
british man
he was just a like a mannequin yeah
that's all they needed was just someone
to wear that costume because boba fett
wasn't a character
it was just a plot device essentially
someone's chasing down uh han solo yeah
i need somebody to chase han solo i had
a bunch of costume parts
that's it and now he's just this epic uh
whatever
[ __ ] [ __ ] at all
we glossed over our marvel shows i've
watched any of that [ __ ]
loki's monovision was good i watched one
division that was interesting it was
different um and then
captain falcon and something something
and then something else suck came out
don't care oh no it's hawkeye that's
ohaka yeah hawkeye jeremy irons and his
daughter i feel like wanda vision kind
of caught on in a way where like people
that aren't super into the marvel stuff
were watching it and interested in what
was the first that was the and it was
the first so maybe that's it and then
then all the other shows no one really
cares about it other than like the
die-hards i don't know i i just i think
i i gravitate more towards
uh
i like i like the marvel stuff in a
condensed movie
once a year sure i don't want to watch a
show and same with star wars
i i think i
gravitate more towards
mature themed adult
character drama stuff maybe because i'm
i'm a grown up
that's why i watched bad trip
that's
comedy's an exception but i don't i
don't care about marvel stuff anymore or
star wars stuff they're they're just
digging their own grave deeper and
deeper i i wouldn't go that far the
their new spider-man movie is like the
third highest grossing movie of all time
or whatever
yeah yeah i think it still has an
audience i think with that movie though
it's more it's the novelty of well that
too but yeah also the fact that they
brought back all the old characters it's
like they're covering all their bases
oh when i said digging the grave they're
digging their own grave i thought of
that first episode of tim and eric's
bedtime stories
get in the hole murph
dennis
get in the hole
honey
that's not a 20 21 show anyways but you
know it is
it's a segway oh oh okay into beef house
beef boys beef boys beef bullets
boys deuces and twos are wild nothing
beats game night at the bee's house
boro's gonna become a permanent member
of the beef house
oh yes i watch beef house it's excellent
but it's done i think god damn ben man
only sitting around down here watching
that vr porn [ __ ] take that [ __ ] up to
your room god damn it i tried to watch
the ding dong porn but it's not working
let me take a look at that ship one and
done as they say yeah there's only so
much you can do with that premise
because beef house is sort of a parody
of like full house type
it's a sitcom parody yeah yeah yeah but
it's just uh uh to my decker and eric
wareheim live in a house eric werheim
has a wife but all these random weird
men live in the house
and it's called the beef house
and it's like i don't know they're like
11 minutes long it's like a
whatchamacallit adult swim thing yeah um
so i think there's like six seven eight
episodes but i don't i don't know i only
saw the one with excessive diarrhea yes
that's the one i saw it was good right
right and you're not into that i mean
not even i am i just i haven't watched
the rest of it if it was projectile
vomit you would be laughing your ass off
i was the one laughing my ass off
because it was projectile diarrhea oh
god the force of the diarrhea tore right
from the trousers
oh my god i keep [ __ ] i can't stand
[ __ ]
oh my god i'm literally [ __ ] on star
wars well the whole premise of that
episode where they're running a hose to
the hot tub so he can have diarrhea in
the hot tub and the girl won't notice
that's the girl's like old lady
that's right yeah it's just hot date in
the hot tub yeah yeah can i be honest
with you
right now i have a tube coming out of my
ass and out of your hot tub back to the
beef house and into a toilet that just
that like satirical like parody
taking those those like tired sitcom
conventions yeah yeah yeah and just
making perverting them yeah
yeah but like you said as
this is a long running series it will
run out of steam very cool
it could be a
you know like a
an episode of
like like the tim and eric show where
you just have a beef house one and then
you cut the next episode of something
else it needs to be something like that
but
um and it's probably inaccessible to
other people
but that's why i like bedtime stories
because it was anthology every everyone
was different yeah and those were good
and they were and they were i mean
obviously beef houses meant to look like
a sitcom the nice thing about bedtime
stories it felt sort of cinematic
correct very visual correct it was good
i liked uh bedtime stories
what are you telling what are you
telling me what should i talk about now
what are you telling me to do
someone's in my earpiece
what
what talk about my favorite show of the
year
okay
he's he's not wearing an earpiece
it's not american horror story is it no
okay good i did what you you watched it
we watched american horror story i did
we watched it together
well we didn't but
um because it was it was broken up into
two parts i think that was a pandemic
thing
yeah where they broke it up into two
different stories just to reduce how
much time they had with everybody right
because i know pre-pandemic it was
supposed to have some different actors
in it than it ended up having yeah you
watched it you hate american horror
story
i'm on record to say it i don't like
american history horror stuff and and
schlock i don't get why you don't like
it i it's it's every season starts okay
and then they just keep introducing more
and more stuff and it gets so convoluted
that it's not funny to me anymore and
it's just kind of annoying i would
describe american horror story seasons
as
gaudy and embarrassing
but enjoyable yeah i mean they're
intentional he can't be and like i get
that but it's i don't know it's a type
of camp that
usually doesn't work for me but i
watched the new season uh because mac
was gonna be on it uh and i enjoyed it
well i enjoyed it until
that story ended and then the second
story started with aliens and i watched
like two episodes and i said oh this is
the show i hate first you know you jump
off at the same time but in the dark and
then you just start doing it together
and before you know it you're late for
your great thinkers of enlightenment
class because you have your best friends
i'm not watching more of this yeah the
first half uh was good it was it was
like a campier goofier version of like a
midnight mass
where it kind of felt very stephen king
like right much like midnight man yes so
writer goes to the east coast uh
for provincetown
somewhere somewhere on the coast and uh
it's just a little sleepy seaside town
sleepy seaside community and he wants to
write a book but uh he takes a magic
pill that gives him creative inspiration
but at a cost
i think it benefited from
splitting the season into two different
stories because it didn't give him
enough time to have it go on for so long
that it really ruined it france connor
and evan peters play i think they're
both writers and they're they're there
but they they take this magic pill you
become really good at your talent if you
have talent
uh and then but you need to drink blood
like a vampire and if you don't have
talent you turn into nosferatu if you
don't have talent and you take the pill
then yeah it turns you into a a low
low-level
vampire it's such a weird concept
the town is kind of aware of it they
look the other way but there's a new
sheriff and she doesn't know about it
but then she dies and no one questions
anything
and then it just uh
yeah then then it ended
the ending was terrible she i was
expecting her to that's again that might
be a pandemic thing
they had a great concept they didn't
fill it with convoluted [ __ ] but
then it also didn't have a satisfying
ending no the the leading up to it was
good yeah the horrible agent lady just
ends up back in like la and spreads the
pill around there and they just seem to
ramp it up and then that it's even worse
with the alien one i didn't even finish
it
it just ends there's literally like no
ending
that must be pandemic-related it was
really weird it was like yeah you had
these kind of like awful young
characters that were annoying
and then i would cut from like that to
the past
yeah
harry truman and uh
richard nixon and they were making the
deal with the aliens yeah
and the aliens would blow people's heads
up
and then it just ended there was
literally like no story arc it was
really bizarre weird just everyone just
blew up so you're saying i missed out by
not finishing it you made a wise choice
not to finish okay uh and and that's my
usual reaction to american horror story
the end watch the first couple episodes
i'm out right
so the second half of the season
which is a shame because i actually
enjoyed the for the most part the the
first story
the mac story it was good up until like
the oven up until the ending how they
finished it yeah i wanted lily rabe to
uh
recover from being a nosferatu and would
get revenge and reclaim her family like
a movie like a story
like she established characters and then
they go through a journey throughout the
the story right yes
her
it was the story of her family
she lost her husband and her daughter to
this this vampire pill
and they became awful and you know
they weren't awful and she needed to
rescue them and reclaim
i mean i know it's a horror movie and it
can have a dark ending but it had like
a weird ending yeah unsatisfying
unsatisfying it's just like oh now it's
spread over here whatever you leave
get it shut off the tv [ __ ] off
okay but like you said we don't know
what happened with the production or
what they could and couldn't film maybe
they had to leave that town they
couldn't wherever they were filming they
couldn't film there anymore oh let's
just shoot the ending
in front of our studio in l.a yeah
something happened and
get a bunch of extras of zombies just
film it real quick and
[ __ ] it
that's what that's what it felt like
yeah goodbye mrs eisenhower
lastly
my favorite show
is called ghosts
this is zach baggins production no
uh do these ghosts have adventures i
mean what sort of [ __ ] believes in
ghosts you are a ghost well yeah but you
know before i became one you wouldn't
have caught me believing in this sort of
nonsense every show that i've watched
most of them i will never go back and
watch in my whole life because you can't
just pluck a random episode from them
and watch it yeah
you have to start at the beginning and
you have to go through the whole [ __ ]
storyline whether it's you know
prestige television or
like a limited series based on a book
that's ten you know one of those things
this is a straight-up classic sitcom
this girl and this guy live in this
dumpy apartment and she discovers that
her wealthy
uh relative this old lady own lives in a
mansion and has died
so it's a show about these ghosts that
are stuck
there and they're from all different
time periods that's kind of the first
season of american horror story right
yeah yeah yeah um
but there you know there's like uh but
this is where this is the twist i'll get
you the twist so they the girl goes to
this house
and she accidentally uh falls out a
window and hits her head and
dies for a minute but but is brought
back to life and that gives her the
ability to see and interact with the
ghosts when her boyfriend can't okay and
so that's your comic setup
you have
eight or so ghosts
uh going back to kate there's a caveman
ghost
going all the way to like a modern day
ghost
that's also kind of uh what we do in the
shadows right there's like vampires yeah
yeah but um uh so i watched a couple
episodes and i'm like this is this is
okay
it's kind of lame
and then i was watching the american
version and then i realized that it
started off as a british show like the
office okay so i went and watched the
british show billion times better
the american shows it
not good
uh the british version hilarious
and great i can assure you that there
are no ghosts it goes there's
what's your last what's your last uh
pick what's your last movie you want to
talk about jay oh well let's let's end
our 2021 special on a disgusting pervert
film i saw titan
or titan
it's a french movie
it's about a woman that [ __ ] a car and
gets impregnated by the car
are you a bunch of car [ __ ]
yeah we're car [ __ ] so what what and
that's just the kickoff it's actually
really good it i was surprised i assumed
it's a
french director her last movie was
called raw
about a girl
yeah a girl goes to college and
and experiments with cannibalism
and then i heard that this movie has
some kind of extreme stuff so i was
prepared for that but that's just kind
of the setup and then the actual story
becomes a lot more
kind of uh
emotional and touching than you would
expect from
a movie about a woman that [ __ ] a car
and yes the automobile was originally
developed for the purposes
of [ __ ] it kind of becomes about
because she
uh she's trying all these different
things like she dabbles in being a
lesbian and she murders people and she
[ __ ] a car you should be ashamed of
yourselves why oh no reason just that
your car [ __ ] she's trying to find
herself because she [ __ ] a car uh it's
it's very vague you don't they they keep
it very vague and artsy uh it's very
tastefully done when she [ __ ] the card
okay we're only guilty of a love for
which there is no name oh there's a name
actually it's called car [ __ ] um
thinking like a gear shift or i i don't
know tailpipe i have my mind she's
inside the car okay that's all you
really know okay the details of it is
hopefully it's not the cigarette lighter
just my mind's trying to figure it out
but uh if you say it's artsy and vague
i'll accept that okay okay but but she
has a a a
definite kind of attraction to
automobiles and and metal when she was a
little kid she was in a car accident and
they had to put a a metal plate in her
head so she has like this giant scar
behind her ear
but she murders some people
and then she has to go into hiding to
get away from the cops so she
disguises herself as a boy
and uh introduces herself to the the
chief of this
fire station who lost his his son like
10 years earlier she says hey
i'm your son i've come back
and she is now
uh disguised as her son but there's a
ticking clock element because she's
impregnated by the car
so her belly's getting bigger apparently
when you're impregnated by a car
it happens at a different rate than a
human pregnancy it's not nine months
okay so eventually her cover is going to
be blown that she's not actually this
man's son
that's come back after 10 years she's
going to give birth to a transformer
but it becomes this thing it's not just
like weirdness like it becomes this
thing about like
trying to find yourself and uh
accepting other people uh everyone
around him is like this is absurd that's
clearly not your son and so it becomes a
thing of like does he know is he just
does he just want his son to be back to
see yeah um
and her trying to the girl trying to
find her place in the worlds and
uh surprisingly artful for a film about
a woman that gets impregnated by a car
okay one of my favorites of last year
all right um yeah really well done not
for everyone obviously it's very [ __ ]
weird but okay was it disturbing or
perverted it has some some kind of
extreme moments not as many as i was
expecting like i said it starts off
that's where all the really crazy stuff
happens and then when it settles into
this story between this this woman
pretending to be a man
and the fireman
uh
that's kind of a hard time
and it takes this awful awful person who
the main character is and and
portrays her in a way that kind of you
know gives some empathy a little bit of
body horror a little bit of uh
david cronenberg movie crash
where people are turned on by car
accidents right a little bit of that in
there okay so a little bit of everything
just a little bit of everything
a little bit of miracle on 34th street a
little bit
wizard of oz
so jay what will
what will 2022 bring us oh hopefully
more delays
more things being dumped on streaming
more marvel shows i won't watch
there's so much to not look forward to
oh [ __ ]
i gotta go get my covid test sorry i
forgot to mention that
oh jesus christ
i edited it out of the video but he's
been coughing after like every sentence
