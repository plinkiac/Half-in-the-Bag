half in the bag well Jay it's a new year new US
literally what do you mean by that I don't know
well Jay it's a new year new us and now that covet is officially over 2023 could
be the year that America and the world return to the movie theaters that's right Mike just look at Avatar too it
did way better than I was expecting that's right Jay so what other theme park rides are you looking forward to
this year Ant-Man and the WASP Quantum Mania Creed Three Scream Six Shazam two
John Wick four Indiana Jones four I mean five Guardians of the Galaxy 3
Fast and the Furious 27. Dungeons and Dragons the Super Mario Brothers movie
The Flash starring Ezra Miller Transformers 12. Mission Impossible nine
Wonka Ghostbusters Aquaman and more
well at least we have Oppenheimer to look forward to that's right Mike Christopher Nolan is one of those rare
actual filmmakers with a singular Vision that isn't a puppet of Disney well Jay you're thinking of Kermit and Miss Piggy
but I understand your point Nolan is a true filmmaker very passionate about his
art his next film Oppenheimer looks amazing pure Cinema he has all the best
Hollywood has to offer at his fingertips the movie's shot on IMAX film it has the
best locations the best cast and of course the best crew top of the line from all the different departments
camera operator photography sound design and naturally the best boom operator
in the business the best the best boom operator in the business
like the guy that holds the pole with the microphone on it yeah what'd you think I meant I mean I assume
that's what you meant because you were talking about people that are involved with the production right yeah I would imagine such a high cost
production would have the best boom operator in the business and I would think so yeah who's Oppenheimer
but before we continue into 2023 let's flash back and talk about some movies
and TV shows that we watched in 2022 we did one of these halfway through the
year and it feels like eight years ago yeah I don't even remember what we would
have talked about well Jay admittedly I watched many more TV series than I did
movies because you recommended many to me I did I don't think I've watched any of them no uh I have a hard time getting
into TV shows I don't know why you're a movie man I'm a TV show man I have a hard time picking a movie sure like you
seem to just like I'll put this on and hope for the best at least I know it'll be over in two hours a TV show it's like
oh do I because there's always that thing when someone recommends a TV show to you or they say you gotta get past
the first 26 seasons and then it gets really good yeah no no no no I didn't listen to anyone's advice I I I have a
list of maybe four five six TV shows that I started and maybe got one episode
in one and a half and I said for these Reasons I'm out that's that's when you have to stop because you watch three or
four then you're like well I might as well finish it so yeah I have a couple of those but uh I did watch a couple
movies as well I'm sure you did you want to you want to start are well we both saw X
which is shockingly that was this year but we can talk about X and pearl together I don't know if you saw I
didn't watch parole amount this is interesting to me this is kind
of fascinating it's very unusual where just a franchise just pops up out of
nowhere out of order out of order because Pearl is a prequel but just out of someone's tie West and Mia Goths just
spur the moment creativity they're shooting X and they're like hey what if
we just stayed in New Zealand for a few more weeks and just made a whole other movie like that's so bizarre that
doesn't happen um so I thought that was interesting and I thought both movies were pretty good I
remember liking x i my memory is a little fuzzy on this because it's been a while but I remember I came out like
January or February so it was a while ago I remember it being sort of like this weird take on like
the porn industry and like then there's like this concept about being desirable
and aging and aging is yeah that's the main theme of the movie and then uh yeah old lady goes crazy because no one wants
to [ __ ] her anymore and so she starts killing young beautiful people right but I remember those those characters
there's a couple there's the couple that's like the photography department and sound Department
and then there's the main cast and I remember like developing all those characters and I thought oh this is
interesting until it kind of becomes like a slasher movie at the end it yeah it turns into
it is a kind of a generic slasher movie but it has that angle of the Killer is a
an elderly woman yeah Youth and beauty and this old woman who's jealous of
their their desirability and it actually it reminded me of there's a movie and I have no idea if Ty West has ever seen or
heard of this movie but there's a movie called on VHS it was released as dead dudes in a house and as the alternate
title of house on Tombstone Hill but it's very similar is like an 80s super
low budget thing yeah a group of kids go to a house to fix it up I think for a sorority or something but it's in the
middle of nowhere which makes no sense and then elderly woman kills them one by one but it's a person in old age makeup
and it looks like Spike Jones and the jackass movies hahaha
and so MIA goth has two parts in this she's the young girl uh wants to be a star and then pearls the elderly woman
who's kind of jealous of uh her ambition because Pearl is settled and just lives
with this cranky old man they're old she never reached her Ambitions oh so Pearl
is the Baxter of the old lady Pearl's the backstory the old lady and I liked Pearl more it's more of like a character
study because at the end they teased the Mia Goth characters backstory with her
like Evangelical televangelist father or something yeah I thought it was going to
like jump back like a year and tell her story I forgot what her character's name was well no I guess there's gonna be a
third movie that's about the the young Mia goth from eggs it's so
bizarre that they're doing all this but like I said like this kind of spur of the moment idea I can't even keep up
with my laundry but uh but I like Pearl more it's it's you know it takes place in the like the
Golden Age of Cinema era and it's kind of shot that way it has a sort of Technicolor feel to it
goth her performance is another one where it's in a horror movie so it'll get overlooked but she's fantastic in it
there's a part where she has this really long emotional monologue and they knew what they got because they never cut
away from her just holds on her face this entire time and it's always interesting when you have like
horror movie or like a slasher movie where the protagonist is also the slasher which [ __ ] a scarecrow in the
first five minutes nobody told me that I would have been their opening weekend that was a cut scene from The Wizard of
Oz well that's it has that's what it's kind of uh those like Busby Berkeley musicals or Wizard of Oz at old
Hollywood it kind of has that feel to it in the context of a horror movie it's
interesting I thought as a like a style exercise it was really unique did you watch smile I did watch smile I watched it like two
weeks ago I have two things to say about smile one I thought for what it was it
was pretty good and two I don't remember a [ __ ] thing about it
I need to find an explanation for what happened huh smiling at me clearly it has
similarities to it follows it's like uh it follows the ring a curse movie cursed
horror is the genre and um but with the the new kind of I don't
know I don't call it a trend but path that some horror movies are taken where uh it's not just a horror movie but it
has uh the woven in kind of like a social message or and this I think
was about like mental illness it is until it stops being about that and then
it just feels like that's sort of tasteless because there's a monster at the end yeah I don't I don't know how I
feel about Kevin Bacon's daughter was she the lead yeah I had no idea that was Kevin Bacon's daughter her name is like
sore Source bacon good actress but not super like
um memorable that I think was it vanity Pharaoh that had that article about nepo
baby babies yeah and uh I felt I felt compelled to chime in on that because I
wanted to I wanted to defend our our pal Jack Quaid who was included in the nepo
baby I thought he was on the cover I didn't read the article or anything you know talking to him in real life and
hearing some of the things he said about his career and you know he he does not seem to fit into the nepo baby category
like I I am one where I think that I I
am not someone who gets upset about nepotism because it exists in almost every
industry sure in in and a guy who runs a plumbing company the company ends up in
the hands of his kid when his kid gets older right you're in charge of the company now Gus yeah and well and
there's also the concept of if if your parents are two talented actors
I I I believe in genetics and that's sort of that sort of stuff can be passed
down unless they're Tom Hanks I just got this feeling man um that this summer is uh
it's about to be a white boy summer you know I mean let me know if you guys uh can Vibe with that and uh
get ready you know well no no no um uh Colin Hanks yeah I was thinking of
the other one the other one yeah no no it's not it's not a certainty right and that's that's when it's distracting if
people complain about nepotism it's usually because they're watching something and the child of a famous person is in it and they're just awful
yeah then yeah I complain about the performance being bad and they only got it because yeah and and look at any
industry there's there's so many cases where so someone only got up to this level because they knew it's not what
you know it's who you know it's the old adage goes but but you have like famous musicians who you know their their child
ends up being you know a musician as well because it's in their blood or it's what they grew up
around yeah so they pick up a lot of that like you know like a plumber would grow up around his plumber Dance all
right let me try to fix this thing up here or or it's built into the DNA nature versus nurture kind of situation
where it's like either you learn how to how to um you learn about acting you're
in the business you're in the industry and your parents do it and you're sort of just like scooped up yeah or or you could take a completely different route
there's there's for every one nepo baby there's probably 10 children of famous
celebrity actors who just go off in their own path oh sure so you can't just cherry pick and just say like that's a
that's a nepotism thing I don't know it's just to me it's like it's it goes it's like a case-by-case
basis because then you have someone like Paulie Shore who who is like oh yeah Mitzi his mom
yeah who was who ran the comedy store right yeah and you know no dude forget back well you do
anything it doesn't matter that's how I dress but I didn't mean it like that I'm sorry and you're not that old you're
just saying that because you feel bad now because you know the people that like me are gonna [ __ ] you bro dude come on no no no you want you don't have any
friends what what you're saying is Pauly Shore Is a very funny comedian and he inherited from being around The Comedy
Store his whole life Pauly Shore Is a negative um example of nepotism and then there's
you know positive ones like [ __ ] Kurt Russell oh yeah it's on Wyatt Russell
Kurt Russell's father was also an actor yeah so it's like
shut up I just don't care as long as there's Talent behind him who gives a [ __ ] you know it just goes to show and
then you have actors that just come out of nowhere where their parents are blue collar people and they become famous on
this or a famous actor's child just becomes a plumber it could happen so I
just want to make a quick note on that while we talked about Kevin Bacon's daughter
um in smile which I thought was meh I I was just surprised it was a
little more like stylish and Atmospheric than I was expecting I was expecting like one of those like crappy Blum House moves I thought it was fairly like flat
and unstylish I I would say that is the style it's very understated and very like there's lots of Ambience to it I'm
not saying it's a great movie I've forgotten the whole thing I'm just saying I I was expecting more of like uh
do you remember like Truth or Dare the blumhouse movie like something like that so I thought for what it was it was okay
but definitely not memorable yeah no no no no no no no no I mean it gets a lot of mileage out of the fact that those
people stare at the camera with the creepy smile is creepy looking foreign
so my next on the list is a movie called don't worry darling Oh the movie marred
with controversy actor and director Olivia Wilde breaking her silence in the custody battle with her ex Ted lasso
star Jason Sudeikis and the moment she would served custody papers right there before taking the stage to promote her
new film The Moments kept coming inside the theater everybody wondering today and I cannot believe I'm asking this
question did Harry really spit on Chris you know I think this might be a bit of a wake-up call for Miss Flo the fans
undecided but the headlines are everywhere and uh but I watch this
uh as [ __ ] terrible I'm sorry it's uh I didn't know uh well at this point I
knew but I didn't know Harry Styles was acting like I'm Vaguely Familiar with them yeah I know very little to me his
music is terrible it's like the most like milk toast boring like like elevator music
you could hear and I don't everybody likes him because he's a handsome young man who's wears Grandma's clothes on
stage not afraid to wear a dress and and and he's a hip dude and he was part of
the Backstreet Boys or something and now I didn't realize he was that old but I watched that whole movie uh dunker is he
in that and he's in it the whole time no and I saw the end credit I love Dunkirk
um and I watched it and uh oh yeah that was him oh that was that guy from Backstreet Boys he was in
Dunkirk Victory is safe and secure
he lived a life you deserve is it it's supposed to have some sort of like social commentary right yeah
it kind of gave me I didn't see I think I saw like maybe part of a trailer I don't even think I watched the whole
trailer but I got like Stepford Wives yeah vibes okay so spoilers for this
because I don't care the time codes for all the movies yeah whatever you want to say so if you want to watch don't worry darling and you don't want me to spoil
it for you go ahead and Skip don't worry darling don't worry darling um yes the the name implies the condescension yeah
men put towards them don't worry darling we'll take care of everything and so it's it's uh it's a Sci-Fi kind of movie
uh which I didn't expect I thought it was like a real drama based on the poster yeah so it's this idyllic
Community where these men go off to work at like a mysterious place and the wives
have very subservient lives where they just vacuum and clean and they're they're happy and they they literally
have nothing to do but clean their house and they get on this like trolley and it
goes into this town and they go shopping and they could just pick out whatever they want no no cost and they bring all their
clothes home it's very like demeaning to women sure and it's like very like um the men control the women's lives and
they go off do business things yeah and then they're the and so Florence pukes starts to unravel this and she goes to
this this like secret compound at the top that's supposed to be their work and it's nothing it's like this like
computer headquarters and she touches it and she's like ah our brain gets fried and so is she is she sad the whole time
not really Harry Styles in the movie he's a successful businessman but in
real life he's like like a loser that sits on on his computer
and Florence Pugh is like a ER nurse or something who works like in 20-hour Long
shifts and she's miserable and so he hires this company
to put a little headset oh no on her eyes Okay and then he keep he keeps her
alive by like pouring water in her mouth and every day he like this is the shocking
Twist of the movie This is the shocking Twist of the movie she is living in like essentially The
Matrix
and there's like they wear like this little headset and those lasers going into their eyes and they're like
and I'm like I'm so dizzy does she wear a diaper does she change a
diaper just to become atrophied you're not supposed to think about those things it's a metaphor Mike it's a metaphor for
for toxic masculinity for men not being able
to live up to the standards and blah blah blah blah and wanting to control their women and it was just so like
sounds like a very very original statement it was so thin yeah and it's presented in such a the first like 75 of
it is presented in such a uh like a highbrow kind of artistic way it was it was
intriguing when she was like discovering some of the truths of what's going on and I'm like oh no this is going to lead to nonsense
JJ Abrams I was like is she in a like a psych ward in a coma or some something
like that like I would have taken that but cut there's literally a silly sci-fi
device on her head and that he's bought and and he's paid
the subscription for well this all sounds very obvious and when it comes to the commentary
angle oh yeah obvious and blunts it's very blunt and kind of dumb and it feels
like a very long like Twilight Zone episode from the 1950s yeah it doesn't feel like like smart or contemporary or
like you know what's that show Elizabeth Moss wearing a nun costume oh
handmade like something like that where it's like that's a metaphor similar kind of style yeah I haven't watched it but
I'm Vaguely Familiar with what they're trying to do with that show and I think that's probably probably does it smarter
I don't know I've never seen it but this is like dumb sci-fi like like it's like a one-off Next Generation
episode it's it's too lame it's too like college student screenplay
lame and it's like oh this this sci-fi premise doesn't hold water
just let yourself go relax
well speaking of college students screenplays and ham-fisted commentary I
watched Glass Onion the new Ryan Johnson film will you explain it to us then
well hit me with the Deets on the last onion I skipped it well did you we never
talked about Knives Out you never saw Knives Out I saw it like well after it came out I feel similar to this that I
did to that which is it's pretty good despite Ryan Johnson I think he's very
talented in certain aspects but specifically the way he writes characters and his humor is not his
strength or it's not for me I guess I should say that both of these movies have just like really strong casts and
he really knows how to construct a scene and get Great Performances but man his
characters it's so ham-fisted Edward Norton is playing he's Elon Musk he's
basically just Elon Musk and it's interesting because this movie would have been made before the the the all
the Twitter uh train wreck nonsense where people are like wait is Elon Musk
really stupid you dim with it brainless jackass
and this was made before that and the whole movie again spoilers the whole movie hinges on the fact that Edward
Norton's character who is Elon Musk is really really stupid he puts on an error of knowing what he's
talking about but then they go back through the movie and they show little moments where he's using like Words incorrectly or made up words that just
sound like big words so that's kind of the hook of the whole movie Kate Hudson
is in this and her characteristic is that she's dumb she talks into a lamp thinking it's an
Alexa device and that's the joke but then to make sure you understand the joke she says oh this is just a lamp
where it's like his humor is so bad this can't Shazam it's a lamp whatever if
you're gonna make a movie with some sort of social political message that's fine as long as it doesn't feel so ham-fisted
simplistic what's it about pandering it's a murder mystery both of these movies are murder mysteries uh this one
takes place on an island and they're having a murder mystery party and Daniel Craig shows up because he's the world's
greatest detective and he was supposedly invited but Edward Norton who's putting the whole thing on he's like wait I
didn't invite you who invited you why is there an actual detective here there's a whole scene early on we're
boring now can I can I make a Segway sure get out of this Glass Onion okay I
would love to get out of this glass it's not a bad movie I should say uh the actual like story is relatively engaging
it's just the way he writes humor and characters that I find annoying
uh uh let me let me segue that uh and into TV okay because I saw a thing on
the internet and there were two posters and had White Lotus season two Glass Onion and there
was a greater than sign no in the White Lotus yes um you what you're described and I was
like whoa whoa what what's going on now that you describe Glass Onion I get the connection there's another movie we can
talk about shortly okay that'll tie in with this as well yeah uh just real quick
uh if you want a palette cleanser from Glass Onion go to White Lotus season two
we're on a family vacation right now and it's just the three of us because all the women in our family hate you
I didn't really care for White Lotus season one I thought it was pretty good and they're separate stories right
totally separate stories what uh Jennifer Coolidge AKA Stifler's mom yes
uh is is is on the only character that transfers over okay she's like this
billionaire like heiress and she's like clueless and and kind of like zoned out
and checked out a life and so she's playing the Jennifer Coolidge character she's yes she's pretty she's good but um
and it has no connection to the first other than it's the White Lotus is like a trademarked Resort the first one takes
place in Hawaii and this new one takes place in Italy so she goes and travels to White Lotus Italy their their Italian
Resort um and other than that it's a completely different story the first season was
kind of about uh classism watching them eat every night makes me like gouged my eyes out
and then it had kind of an ending that just kind of seemed like it fell apart and it was like I liked it but I don't get all
the praise but season two uh there's always a mystery of of uh it
starts off with a dead body and you treat you want to know who the dead body is at the end first season it was one
dead body this one there's five or six bodies that are floating ashore okay and we were like and you've
got to figure out who the main who which one of our main characters may end up dead and it's got many different facets
of relationships there's like cheating there's there's two prostitutes in there people using sex to get ahead there's
like there's different couples Dynamics I mean there's a lot going on it's all very very well written and performed and
it's so like smart um based on like how the characters act there are no dumb idiots talking into do
you get that he's dumb right you get that this character's does none of that it's it's really like
complex and interesting and Aubry Plaza is really good in it everyone's good in
it but I really enjoyed it it just kind of compounds and there's so much going on I don't want to
get into it
well that's yeah that's a case of comparing that to Glass Onion and knives out where you can
have a some sort of message some sort of commentary social commentary social
criticism and it can even be broad it can even be like in your face and blunt
as long as everything else is Well written yeah which leads into the menu
you have to try the mouse feel at the minionette please don't say mouthful tonight will be Madness couldn't be more
on the nose as far as what they're saying rich people are pretentious and don't care and that's Glass Onion that's
I'm assuming White Lotus has an element of that and then the menu also does not the season of light okay the first
season I remember hearing about that first season definitely not this one but uh but yeah in the menu is that same
kind of thing but the premise is so weird that it keeps it entertaining yeah
I love the menu I thought it was maybe one of my favorites this year it's one
of my favorites and it was uh I didn't realize it like I didn't see a trailer I
heard a little bit about it I kind of I didn't expect it to be so funny it's the
funniest movie of last year and it's funny because it's never like trying to be it's the polar opposite of Ryan
Johnson yeah it's funny because of how serious everyone is taking everything yeah uh I saw the trailer and I was I
was looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the trailer and I did not know it was a horror comedy I I assumed
it was going to end up being some sort of cannibal thing from the little bit I saw I was like they're going to turn out that they're
eating people aren't they yeah but that's not where it goes it's it's uh it's wonderful they have it's it takes
that uh pretentious dining culture that
exists today also the The Cult of Personality with the celebrity chefs yeah clearly they're making fun of uh
Gordon Ramsay yeah because the logo Hawthorne is the restaurant on the island and he's got the H and sort of
like the Hell's Kitchen the HK with the open Kitchen where you can see everybody cookies it's like they're like a cult well you
actually Olivia all of you all of us Here We are family it's great well
that's that's probably whoever got this whoever wrote this got this idea from that or was in the service industry
themselves because they're it's very like cynical and bitter or they've just watched a lot of Gordon Ramsay shows I
don't know but you watch those like Hell's Kitchen show and they're like yeah it's almost like he's like a drill
sergeant and they're like soldiers yeah they'll die for him and it's so it's
very satirical it's over the top but it still plays straight it doesn't get goofy until the end but it's so and it's
so and this is another comparison to Ryan Johnson it's so like pointed and snarky like and sharp-witted with like
when I think of the Ryan Johnson stuff I just think of like I think you talked about this one you talked about the Last Jedi maybe it was the blanket review I
was like he's such a like soft spoken guy you made a Star Wars movie
when he doesn't seem to have any understanding of war and that's I wish his Knives Out movies were meaner
because these are all supposed to be like awful characters but he's just he doesn't go for that that edge or that
like sharpness to the way he writes the the bad characters so they come off more
goofy than mean and here this movie has a mean streak and it totally works oh
yeah yeah yeah it reminded me of like Willy Wonka a little like they get invited to this unique
experience and uh they're all like rotten yeah except they don't have to
learn their except for one that's so yeah you know the uh it wasn't supposed to be there with spoiler alert
um the the cheeseburger is is the well the Everlasting Gobstopper yeah yeah you
know that's good where it's like the Purity that's what she um spoilers
uh she she finds that picture of him and the only time she finds a picture of him
smiling we're talking him meaning the Chef Ray finds refines is great as um
he's he's clearly like gone mad from dealing with this culture of of
snootiness and trying to achieve Perfection uh he's gone mad and um she
finds the only picture of him is him smiling when he's making a cheeseburger when he's like a young man just starting
off yeah and so she appears she's like she appeals she's a an escort yeah they
just not involved in this scene and they don't dwell on that a whole lot there's like a couple lines that I just kind of
mentioned it off-handedly yeah so he's like he's like you're a professional you provide a service and it's like oh got
it because because her companion is uh what's his face Nicholas
Holtz and he shows both of them doing American accents neither of them are American they're both good yeah they're
both good um oh he's hilarious in this he's hilarious she's good in this um but yeah they show up and she's not on
the list and he's specifically designed this dinner the menu and the dinner party for very
specific people that he thinks needs to die yeah in his Grand
his granddaughter Grand Finale Grand Finale but yeah and she's just like
she appeals to his inner sense his inner inner child where he's just like I just want a cheeseburger make it real good
and he's like oh yeah yes I'm gonna cook you the best cheeseburger ever and um you want this because you
genuinely want to eat a cheeseburger you're not trying to impress anyone you're not you're not trying to show how like sophisticated you are and I just
love I was laughing constantly during this yeah which that's I get all that stuff you watch those cooking shows I
like that stuff and that's the aspect of it that I wasn't I was completely maybe other people have talked about it I was so unaware of everything surrounding
this movie so that was what caught me off guard was just how funny it was the best line or he's like what what college
did you go to what school did you go to Brown student loans
I'm sorry you're dying I love when the food critic lady gets the tiny little Emulsion and has a crack in it and then
he keeps sending her bigger and bigger it's that that uh and again that's not
subtle like it's it's pretty blunt about what it's saying but it it uh it has the
the humor and the snark and the style the way the movie's made to back it up yeah it doesn't feel juvenile no no it
feels smartly written insane because the [ __ ] around the total
absence of the bread is like really good because that culture has changed the
chef culture is changed in the last like 20 30 years of the celebrity chef the rise of the celebrity chef and um
and that sort of like you know dining has always been there's been many levels of fancy dining but now
it's just gotten absurd the the liquid nitrogen and then the
this and that well yeah and we're in this where he's [ __ ] with them where the this is the second course where it's
just like condiments yes and no bread no bread bread is the food of the poor people
and then pretending that this is some sort of brilliant you know second course right like you're just you're you're
following him along his the cult of personality is and then even at the end
when they're all getting killed they just they can't even stand up for themselves they're so
pathetic yeah um but yeah it's it's it's a biting satire that's really fun
of a very specific kind of you know we we've gone through all the
social satire we can yeah um and this is this is nice because there's no necessarily no
big weight to it no heaviness than you have with like I don't know me too or
mental illness or whatever where there's like a real world it's like it's something you can kind of sit back and
laugh at unless you're unless you're a snobby food critic who makes their living being a snobby food critic goes
hmm this is a little [ __ ] offensive but um if you're just a regular person
even if you enjoy a nice meal but there are people that
take it a little too far but yes great great films uh did you watch the triangle of sadness
no no that's sort of a similar type of thing too right it's right in between Glass Onion and
the menu where they're making fun of Rich the rich and I'm sure you've seen
the trailer it looks paid for the tickets not bad
huh that's what do you do I sell [ __ ] it's uh it's funny
for most of it but it's yeah it's a little like it's like the menu where it
goes over overboard especially the part where the the yacht
sinking and they're having this nice dinner and all these people are so rich they're just they don't know what's
going on they're all stupid like in the in the trailer she's asking Woody Harrelson who plays the captain of the
yacht to clean the sails yeah and he's like we don't have sales this is a motorized vessel
she's like would you clean the sails I was like we'll clean the sales and Woody
Harrelson he's like drunk all the time and he just doesn't want anything to do with this I'm invited I am not a
communist I am not a communist I am a Marxist there's the Russian the Russian
capitalist he he made his money off [ __ ] I said [ __ ] literal [ __ ] off fertilizer okay
and then Woody Harrelson plays the American Socialist and so they they have this little banter
back and forth where they're just like like throwing quotes at each other Margaret Thatcher Karl Marx they're
going back and forth there on their phones while the ship's sinking and they're going through the storm and everyone's drunk and then it all falls
apart um but the main stars are two young people
uh who are both like the girl is an influencer so they got on the boat for free because they're going to do
influencing taking selfies and what whatever yeah the satire becomes a
little too heavy-handed and it becomes interesting because the person on the island that ends up taking control of
the situation is the head toilet cleaner but she knows how to like fish she knows
how to start a fire she knows how to do all the things that none of these people know how to do yeah so she ends up
becoming like um this little dictator it's like Lord of the Flies meets Animal Farm I thought
the whole thing was on a boat only some of it the majority of it is on an island and so it's like about like rationing
their food and she they start following her she's their leader and she starts
abusing her power she starts having sex with the young guy in the boat to give
him like pretzels uh abuse of power wealth
social status different types of like uh
Society how Society like inter operates communism capitalism
dictators dictatorships like it just like boils it down and I thought this this this could work but it just goes on
way too long and then the ending is ambiguous to the
point of frustration the you know how some movies end and you're just like oh there's nothing else like I don't know
for me it was an ambiguous ending that just it didn't work because I wanted some kind of closure on it and it didn't
make me think any more about what had happened um it just ended so uh there was some
good there are good moments in it it's a really good direction of actors it has this real like natural quality it's all
the performances and stuff and and the choices that are made good director I
liked it well enough a little disappointed because I was looking forward to that one too
you know what else I'm looking forward to going an ad break an ad break
help me Jesus
