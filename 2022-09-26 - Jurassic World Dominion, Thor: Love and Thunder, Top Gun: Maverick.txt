PLINKETT:
Half in the bag!

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

JAY:
Well, now we're all caught up with all the big summer blockbuster movies that we didn't see in theaters.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.

JAY:
And I definitely don't feel like it was a waste of 10 hours of our lives.

MIKE:
Was that sarcasm?

JAY:
I can't wait to watch the extended cut of Jurassic World: Dominion.
If there's one thing I want it's more of that.

MIKE:
Anyhoo.

JAY:
We watched, we watched "real movies".
We watched the big ones.

MIKE:
We watched three big summer blockbusters, when the blockbuster is almost as extinct as dinosaurs themselves.
Uh, and it's interesting because the three blockbuster films we chose to discuss, uh, go from, uh...
Well, it's the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Um, go from great to okay to terrible.
Almost, uh, perfectly line up.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And our opinions might differ a little, Jay.
But uh that's where, where I'm starting this discussion out as.

JAY:
Okay.
Are we starting with the good or the ugly?

MIKE:
I guess we'll start with the ugly.
I don't know if anyone even cares to hear about our opinions on Jurassic World: Dominion.
So we'll get that one out of the way.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Right out of the gate real fast.
"The Asylum presents Fantasy Dinosaur Force from Colin 'Never Smile' Trevorrow, the director of The Book of Henry."
"He's back with another Jurassic World film."
"This time, Owen Thunderguns and his subjugated lady friend must find their daughter, Eleven, who they hide in a cabin in the woods because she's a human clone who was reproduced asexually in a lab by her mother who died of clone cancer."
"However Owen and subjugated lady friend can't just sit still in that cabin and get real jobs."
"They've got to go on dino-saving adventures to show that they care about dinos."
"Oh."
"And dinosaurs are all over the planet."
"But people still go out living their lives, going to drive-in movie theaters and walking around in the park where dinos can eat them."
"Did I mention that?"
"The fact that dinos are all over the planet brings out the best and the worst in people."
"However, old friends Dr. Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant, and Dr. Jeff Goldblum are on a separate mission to find out why Hank Scorpio and the Globex Corporation have created giant locusts that terrorize children."
Would you like to hear the IMDb description real quick?

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
"Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, Biosyn operatives attempt to track down Maisie Lockwood, while Dr. Ellie Sattler investigates a genetically engineered swarm of giant insects."
Uh, not a once-a mention of a dinosaur in the IMDb description.

JAY:
Well, that's pretty appropriate.
Because this isn't a movie about dinosaurs.
It's a movie about locusts.
Finally, at the end of the second movie in a franchise called Jurassic World, they establish that the dinosaurs are loose now.
That stupid clone girl let 'em loose because they're real, like her.

MAISIE LOCKWOOD:
I had to.
They're alive.
Like me.

MIKE:
Oh, that's right.
That's how that one ended.

JAY:
That was the line.
It was the dumbest ending to one of the dumbest movies that's ever been made.
Uh, and so I'm like:
"Finally, now the next movie, we're finally gonna get fucking dinosaurs rampaging cities and causing havoc all over the world."
And we get, like, uh, like, uh, like, an Instagram, uh, news update at the very beginning.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
There's, like, there's some dinosaurs here.
Anyway, locusts.

MIKE:
There was one scene where a T-Rex rampaged through, uh, a drive-in movie theater.

JAY:
Which isn't in the theatrical cut.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
We watched, uh...

MIKE:
No shit!

JAY:
Yeah.
You watched the extended cut on Peacock.
You watched the theatrical cut, which has even less dinosaurs.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
There have never been more dinosaurs than there are in Dominion in a movie.

MIKE:
No kidding.

JAY:
That whole opening of the extended cut where we see 65 million years ago...
There's dinosaurs fighting.
We see the mosquito land.
And, and then that goes into the, uh, the drive-in movie theater scene.
None of that's in the theatrical cut.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
You see dinosaurs in snow.
You see dinosaurs in cities.

MIKE:
How does it open?

JAY:
It, it opens with the, uh, Instagram story or whatever it is.
NowThis.
It opens with that.
Actually, no.
I think there's, very briefly, there's the bit where the...
They're trying to lure the dinosaur out of the water, and it bites onto the cage.
I think it shows that, and then it goes to the new story.
But, yeah.
That whole opening, which is one of the very few moments of dinosaurs actually wreaking havoc somewhere in public.
It's just gone.

MIKE:
Wow, that's surprising.

JAY:
Look, you don't have time to put dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
There have never been more dinosaurs than there are in Dominion in a movie.
Like, maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie.

MIKE:
It was like two movies in one.
Like, the, the Owen Thunderguns and, uh, Bryce Dallas Howard stuff.
And then, uh, and their pilot friend, Kayla.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Um...

JAY:
Han Solo?

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Kayla Watts is Han Solo.
Yeah.

MIKE:
We'll talk about that in one second.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, and, and Maisie Lockwood.
The clone.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, the, the...
There's some biblical elements in this film.
I want to get really intellectual here.

JAY:
Well, Colin Trevorrow, he's a smart man.

MIKE:
He's a smart...

JAY:
He writes very smart scripts.

MIKE:
The, the virgin birth.
Uh, uh, she, she is, she is like, like, a messiah because she contains the...
She contains genes that could possibly save the world because she's, she's the new Jesus.
And, um...

JAY:
I think that's the frustrating thing about Colin Trevorrow, is he does have ideas.
Like, that first Jurassic World movie.
There's a whole meta thing about the original Jurassic Park was great.
And it's like:
"Okay."
"You're trying for something."
"But the rest of everything that's happening is dumb as shit."

MIKE:
There, there are some, like, possibly kernels of good ideas in this.
Like, you know, who, who shows their true colors as being good, good human beings and bad human beings.
Which is like real life, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There would be people trying to make money off it.
And Owen Thunderguns runs into some in the beginning.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Like, he's saving a diplotosaurus, or whatever fucking thing, and, and he's like:
"How much does ground up dinosaur bones go for on the black market?"
"$500,000?"
"$1,000,000?"
"$500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000?"
And so as he lets them go...

JAY:
I'm smiling because that's also not in the theatrical cut.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
That whole sequence.
You see him round up the dinosaur, and then it cuts to him back on the, uh, back at the cabin.

MIKE:
No shit?

JAY:
Another part that's actually kind of interesting.

MIKE:
Yeah!

JAY:
An idea of, like, yeah, these dinosaur poachers...

MIKE:
Right.
Well...

JAY:
It's all gone!
I mean, they come up later in the movie.

MIKE:
I wonder why they cut it out.
Because he...
There's, like, Owen has a couple of, like, park ranger guys with him.
Like, two, I think.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then the bad guy, like, bad cowboy guys, have like six or seven guys on horses.
And they all have shotguns.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And the two, the two, like, wildlife guys are, have, like, just simple pistols.
And so, like, Owen has to, like, he's like:
"I don't want to get in a shootout with these guys."
"We're gonna get fucking slaughtered."
So he lets the dinosaur go.
He lets them have the dinosaur.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it's kind of sad.
They take the dinosaur and they, they cart it off.
And it just kind of goes along with them.
And you know it's going to get killed and stripped of all of its meats.

JAY:
Or used in a cockfight, as we see later in the movie.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Dinosaur fights.

MIKE:
Underground cockfighting.
Um...

JAY:
Which is a part of the maybe 15-20 minute stretch of the movie that I kind of enjoyed.

MIKE:
Yeah.
When they go to Malta?

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it turns into a Mission Impossible movie.

MIKE:
It turns into a...

JAY:
With dinosaurs.

MIKE:
Then you got the Biosyn guy.
The, uh, Steve Jobs, uh, Bill Gates kind of...
He's like the most apathetic, lame, boring villain ever.

JAY:
Well, did you even catch who that was?

NEDRY:
Dodgson!
Dodgson!
We've got Dodgson here!

JAY:
It's a returning character.

MIKE:
What?

JAY:
Remember Dodgson from the beginning of the first Jurassic Park?
He meets Wayne Knight and gives Wayne Knight the Barbasol.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's that character.
They inexplicably decided to bring him back.
He has such a tiny part in that first movie.
He has nothing to do with anything, other than giving him the Barbasol.

MIKE:
But not that actor.

JAY:
Not that actor.
Which is like, if you can't get the actor, then why do it at all?

MIKE:
Well, you know what happened with the actor?

JAY:
Oh!
That's right.
He was like a, he's...

MIKE:
[EXPLICIT]

JAY:
He's, uh, he's one of those those, uh, [EXPLICIT] that I've heard so much about in Hollywood.
There's no reason for that character to be that character from the first movie.

MIKE:
Oh, gosh...

JAY:
Now he's basically Tim Cook from Apple.
Their whole facility...
It's, it's like this round building that looks just like the Apple, uh, headquarters.
If you ever watch any of their, like...

MIKE:
Sure.
They're making some kind of commentary on, like, big tech geneticists that either want to profit from pharmaceutical research, or...

VOICEOVER:
CEO Lewis Dodgson has created a sanctuary in Italy Dolomite Mountains, where he hopes to study the dinosaur's ancient immune systems for unique pharmaceutical properties.

MIKE:
Their sophisticated scientific laboratory, uh, which I'm sure they use a lot of computers, uh, did have beakers filled with colored fluid for the little dinosaur  -- the baby of Blue, the raptor -- to jump around and smash.

JAY:
Well, it's a science lab.

MIKE:
You gotta have a beaker...

JAY:
You gotta have beakers.

MIKE:
With blue, green, red fluids in beakers on tables just open.
No tops on them.
Just sitting there.
Waiting to get smashed in an exciting sequence.

HENRY WU:
The locust's prehistoric DNA has made them stronger than they should be.
They're multiplying like crazy, and they're not dying.
What part of this don't you understand?

DODGSON:
Well, I do understand.

HENRY WU:
This is going to be a global famine.

DODGSON:
Hey, hey.
We can't anticipate everything.
We need to eradicate the ones we've released.

DODGSON:
What?

HENRY WU:
All of them.

MIKE:
His plan with the locusts was what again?
Him and Henry Wu had a good intentions.
But it, they, they genetically engineered locusts to do something, but then it went bad.

JAY:
It got out of control.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then the locusts...

JAY:
And then eventually he sees the error of his ways and burns the rest of the locusts that are still in the facility

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
I just watched this movie.

MIKE:
While also covering his tracks, because he's trying to destroy the hard drive.

JAY:
Yeah.

KAYLA WATTS:
This place?
Not your vibe.

MIKE:
There, there's our friend, Kayla Watts, who's...
And I don't know if...
Again, Colin Trevorrow may be a secret genius because he was fired from Star Wars Part IX.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because he made Book of Henry.
And then everyone panicked because Book of Henry flopped.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
So they fired him from Star Wars IX.
So then we have this Kayla Watts character, who is essentially Han Solo.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Uh, she's a smuggler.
She has her own little aircraft.
And when you're in the cockpit, it looks identical to the Millennium Falcon.

JAY:
The framing of the shots.

MIKE:
The framing of the shots.
The way that you could kind of see the secondary backseats, which probably aren't on a big plane like that.
I don't know.

LUKE:
What's that flashing?

HAN SOLO:
We're losing our deflector shields.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm going to make a jump to light speed.

CLAIRE DEARING:
Why is it blinking?

KAYLA WATTS:
Uh, that's the, uh, Aerial Deterrent System.

MIKE:
And then she's doing the, uh...
When they're trying to land at the Apple headquarters -- the Biosyn headquarters -- she's trying to get landing permission.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And they're like, they're like:
"Permission denied."
You know, it's exactly like when Han Solo's, like, trying to land at, um, the Cloud City.
Or, or fucking around with the, the microphone on the Death Star.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She had that same kind of flair.
So is that, like, his, like:
"Hey, you may have fired me from Star Wars, but I'm putting Han Solo in this movie."

JEFF GOLDBLUM:
I'll tell you.
Colin.
That Colin Trevorrow.
He's good.
He's a good director.

MIKE:
Owen Thunderguns and subjugated lady friend, uh, who no longer has a will of her own...

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
But to follow Owen Thunderguns around to the ends of the Earth.
Because they're in love.

JAY:
And people called the first Jurassic World movie sexist.

MIKE:
Right.
She hasn't, she...
Bryce Dallas Howard no longer has a character.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's not the, the, uh, sophisticated women that she was in the first one, where she ran the theme park.
Now she, uh, runs around and tries to save dinosaurs in cages with, like, scared college students who don't wanna do it anymore.

JAY:
They get rid of those characters real quick.

MIKE:
They were the ones from the other one.

JAY:
They were annoying in the last movie.
They're like:
"Ehh, we'll put them in one scene to explain why they're not in the rest of the movie."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Why even bother?
Just don't have 'em in it.

MIKE:
Kayla the pilot spots the little girl in Malta.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Being stolen by Frau Farbissina to, to be sent to Tim Cook at the Apple headquarters because Henry Wu wants Kayla Lockwood to study her genes to fix how they fucked up the process with the locusts and/or save the human race by figuring out a solution to the world's food supply.
This is...
I got a lot from this by barely patying attention.
I was on my phone the whole time.
Uh, half-asleep.
You know, I was playing checkers on my phone.
So then they're flying in her, her Millennium Falcon.
And, and of course, pterodactyls appears.
No one likes pterodactyls, but they always appear in these movies.

JAY:
Well, they can fly, so they're different than other dinosaurs.

MIKE:
They attack the plane.
They fuck the plane up.
And, um, Owen Thunderguns says:
"This plane's gonna crash, Bryce Dallas Howard."
"Jum-..."
"You better eject."

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Because there's only one ejection seat that works, or something.

JAY:
Something like that.

MIKE:
And, uh, uh, I'm man, I'm man...
I'm Owen Thunderguns.
And you're lady.
You're my subjugated lady.
Uh, and you better get out of the plane.
And so they shoot her out.
And so Owen and Kayla crashland in a, in a ice field...
What is it called?
A frozen lake?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And they get out.
And, of course, it's now time for dino set piece.
Dino action set piece.

JAY:
Plug it in.
Boop!

MIKE:
And, and Kayla...
I think at some point it's revealed that she was former military.

OWEN GRADY:
Where'd you learn to fly?

KAYLA WATTS:
Uh, Air Force.
Legacy on my momma's side.

OWEN GRADY:
Yeah.
I'm Navy.

MIKE:
And Owen Thunderguns is also former military ops.
He has all sorts of skills because he was the, the, the, the velociraptor wrangler.

JAY:
Yeah, he trained the dinosaurs in the first movie.

MIKE:
So he, he has skills.
Let's just say he has adventure skills.
He has survival skills.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
This, this is not in doubt, right?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And Kayla also does.
And they start walking on the ice.
The ice begins to crack under their feet.
What do they do?
They walk slower, and more carefully.
Right?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And there was no dinosaurs around at this time, right?

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
So there was no threat quite yet.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, what do you do in that situation, Jay?
Common sense.

JAY:
Uh, I would run before it all cracks up.

MIKE:
No, no, no.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
That's a bad idea.

JAY:
Well, what's a good idea then?

MIKE:
What you do in that situation is, you lay down on your belly, and you, you army crawl.
Because...

JAY:
So there's less weight going straight down?

MIKE:
Weight, all your weight is distributed on the soles of your feet.
All your weight is centered on one spot.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Movie-wise, it's more exciting for them to slowly walk on the ice, going...

JAY:
You're building the tension, yeah.

MIKE:
Tension.
Uh, but logically, those two characters would know to lay on their bellies and go like this.
Although it would look really silly.
And, and so that kind of stuff -- even though this is a dumb movie -- kind of takes me out a little bit sometimes.

JAY:
Okay.
I was checked out by that point.

MIKE:
I expect more from Jurassic World: Dominion.

JAY:
I will say, the shot where Bryce Dallas Howard gets ejected from the plane...
That's a creative shot.
Where it's just kind of locked on her.
That's something.

MIKE:
She lands in her thing in the woods.
Falls out.
And there's a dinosaur walking around.
And then she goes in the water.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And then the dinosaur looks around for her.
And then walks away.
And then she comes out of the water.
Uh, uh, I felt absolutely nothing.
I felt...
There was no tension.
There was no excitement.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There was literally nothing, other than events happened in a sequence.

JAY:
Scenes happening on-screen.

MIKE:
They happened in a sequence.
Well, the, the...
I noticed three bits of ADR.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
There, there's a funny part -- and I'll play it in this edit -- Jeff Goldblum is lecutring students at the Apple university.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And that's his job there, I guess.
Just to teach, maybe?
As an instructor?

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
A chaos instructor.

JAY:
He has a history with all this stuff, yeah.

MIKE:
And he, he yells:

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

MIKE:
And it's like this wide shot.
And he says it so strangely that I...

JAY:
He says every line strangely.

MIKE:
I know.
But it's, it didn't even sound like him.

JAY:
Oh...

MIKE:
And I thought it was ADR done by, like, a Jeff Goldblum sound-alike.

JAY:
They couldn't get him back that day?

MIKE:
And then, like, like, Colin Trevorrow wasn't around.
And there, then some guy was in the booth, going...
And he goes...
And the actor just goes:
"Unforeseen circumstances occur!"
And they're, like:
"Sure."

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

MIKE:
All right.
We're done.
I just had...
I have these fantasies in my head of how things really went.
And, and, and it was...
It just struck me
And then there's inserts.
Kayla, when a dinosaur appears to attack them...

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
She says:
"Nope!"

KAYLA WATTS:
"Nope!"

MIKE:
And turns and runs.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And it, it was very clearly inserted.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
Like, like, in an, like:
"We gotta have something funny."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then Owen Thunderguns says:
"What an asshole."

OWEN GRADY:
What an asshole.

COACHMAN:
What an asshole.

MIKE:
And, uh, referring to the dinosaur as it falls under the ice.

JAY:
I don't remember any of this.
Is this all in that ice scene?

MIKE:
Yeah.
His back is to the camera, and he turns around, and he's like...
I think she's mid-turn when she says:
"Nope."
But you could see that her mouth isn't moving.

JAY:
Okay.

KAYLA WATTS:
Nope!

JAY:
So it has that, uh, Ghostbusters 2016 syndrome?
Where it's like:
"We have to keep adding funny things everywhere."

MIKE:
Yeah.
We need some quips, because this, this ice scene is dull.
And then, and then, uh, they escape dino.
They get in some kind of elevator?
The door closes.
And then they're like...
They're just, like, bored?
And then he's like:
"Are you good?"
And then she goes:
"Ehh, I'm good."
And then I, I think it was supposed to be read as like:
"We just went through this harrowing nightmarish experience where we barely escaped with our lives."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Are you cool?"
"Yeah, I'm cool."
Like, like where they're both really terrified, but they're both trying to play it cool to each other.

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
But to me, it read as the characters are just...
Or the actors are just, whatever.

JAY:
Well, that, that's how I felt through most of the movie.
Especially with the, like, legacy characters.
Like, Laura Dern looks like she doesn't know what the fuck is going on, whenever there's any action happening.
Which makes the, uh, the, the big scene where they all finally meet.
All of our legacy characters and our new Jurassic World characters, they finally meet.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
They're all in the frame together.
And I think it's supposed to be, like, a magical movie moment, but everybody's just bored.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Nobody cares.

SAM NEILL:
I've kind of fallen in love with Colin.
I just, I just think, you know, his, his enthusiasm, his energy, his boundless optimism...
He loves these films.
He loves directing.
He loves the actors.
You know, he's, he's just...

MIKE:
And then, like, because they solved the locust problem, we cut to a montage at the end where we're back to our Instagram, uh, TikTok news reporter explaining the plot.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And, like, we have nature footage of animals just living in harmony with dinosaurs.
"We're just going to have to live with them."
And I'm like:
"Again."
Uh...

JAY:
Nothing's been accomplished in the movie!
The locusts were stopped.
But it's still, yeah.
"We still haven't learned anything."

MIKE:
From a science perspective -- and I know this isn't, this isn't real life, this movie -- but you, you bring over one weird lizard from a foreign country to the U.S., and it cripples the entire ecosystem of an entire state.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Because they multiple.
They eat food supplies that belong to some other creature, which causes that creature to, to either starve out, which was the food of a different creature taht ate this plant...
And it causes, like, a domino effect.
Having dinosaurs, like, everywhere, living in harmony with nature is just, like, batshit unrealistic.
They, but they show, like, elephant herds walking alongisde, like, those other big dinosaurs.
Triceratops.
They're like, like, co-existing.
And then, like, seagulls are flying with pterodactyls.
And I'm just, like:
"Mm-mmm."
So, I'm like...

JAY:
I, I wouldn't mind any of the stupidity as long as it was fun.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It was a slog.

JAY:
The movie's a slog.

MIKE:
It was a slog.

JAY:
Like I said, that, that whole sequence, uh, the Mission: Impossible sequence where they, they find the underground, uh, dinosaur fights.
And they have a chase through the streets, where the dinosaurs are chasing them.
Like, at least that's kind of taking advantage of the concept of the movie.
And that's kind of it.
And then the rest of it's, just, yeah...
Overstuffed with subplots and characters.
"We gotta put this in there."
"We gotta put that in there."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
It just feels like checkking off boxes of things you're supposed to put in the movie.
Out of curiosity, I looked at, like, the three Jurassic World films.
And it's a, it's a, it's textbook example of diminishing returns, both in critical reception and box office.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Worldwide.

JAY:
I would assume that, yeah, this one's...
I think it still did pretty well, though, right?

MIKE:
Uh, yes.
I have a graphic here.
And I don't quite remember the exact numbers.
But I wanna say the first one, uh, $1.3 or $1.6 billion worldwide.

JAY:
The first one did really well.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And, uh, because it was a fairly solid movie in terms of a reboot.

JAY:
It, it was like a crowd-pleaser.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And it did well at the box office.
But, uh, a lot of people hate it.

MIKE:
Well, sure.

JAY:
I didn't like it.
Uh, you famously -- or infamously -- gave it a good review.
And people were kind of baffled.
You know, it was like you said.
It was meta.
Sort of self-aware.
And it had the fun of a theme park falling apart.
Just on a grander scale than the first one.

JAY:
Com-, compared to the sequels, it feels, like, so much more cohesive and quaint.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
The second one, though...
I have never stopped thinking about that second movie because it is so bizarrely stupid.
Uh, that movie should be, like, a cult classic.
The whole second half taking place in the spooky mansion with, uh, illegal black market dinosaur auctions underneath it.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's, that's where they start to get into this, this idea of what, what would people do if dinosaurs were everywhere.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Accessible, not just a theme park.
And, and they kind of fucked that up, making, like, a smart movie series about it.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Which you're not gonna expect in this day and age.
The second one, I think scraped out just over a billion worldwide.
And then this third one, uh, in the $900 millions.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
So, I mean, obviously, that's a lot of money, but there's the cost of the film, the promotion, and all that kind of stuff, so...
But another thing to factor into is that first and second one were pre-pandemic...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And this one, I think was a pandemic delay, maybe?

JAY:
I think so.

MIKE:
But still, it was, like, probably released at a time when people were, like:
"Ehh, I don't know about going to the movie theaters."

JAY:
That, and they're probably just tired of it, like:
"Oh, another Jurassic World movie?"

MIKE:
And, and fatigue, yeah.
And it's, and, or...
It could've worked to the movie's favor, where the people that did go to the theater who wanna pay what they pay at movie theaters have an option between watching nothing, or Jurassic World: Dominion.
"Hey, we're gonna pay..."
"If we're gonna pay the prices that we pay at the movie theater, why not watch a two-hour-and-thirty-minute long dinosaur movie?"
Like...

JAY:
There's a lot of stuff in the movie.

MIKE:
There's a lot of stuff in the movie.
Uh, rather than watching a 90-minute arthouse film.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
Most, maximum amount of dinosaurs in the movie that we're making.
There have never been more dinosaurs.

CHRIS PRATT:
We truly have spared no expense.
We have amazing action sequences.
We have amazing dinosaur sequences.
We have heart, humor, innovative technology.
Both as like, um, a storypoint in the film, but also...

SAM NEILL:
And epic in...

JEFF GOLDBLUM:
I'll tell you.
Colin.
That Colin Trevorrow.
He's good.
He's a good director.

CHRIS PRATT:
As a narrative around making this film, we're pioneering brand new technologies to make this film.
We have more dinosaurs than you've ever seen in a Jurassic film.

SAM NEILL:
Uh...

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
Like, maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie.

CHRIS PRATT:
New dinosaurs.
New characters.
You know, you look up into the stars, and you think:
"That's 13 billion light years away."
Like, how does...
How is that possible?
That couldn't...
You couldn't...

MIKE:
It was a slog.
It was uninteresting.

JAY:
All's I know is I never ever wanna see another character in a movie do this anymore.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
It made sense in the first movie, because Chris Pratt's training those dinosaurs, and it's part of his move for training.
But now he just does it anytime he sees any dinosaur anywhere.

MIKE:
And, and other people can do it, too.

JAY:
And other people just do it.
And it works, I guess?
I'ma try that move the next time I'm attacked by a dinosaur.

MIKE:
There you go.
There you go.
Yeah.

OWEN GRADY:
I am gonna get her back.
No!
