["Half in the bag."]
Huh.
it looks like Black Widow is doing really well at the box office.
What's a box office?
It's uh the take of movies when they play in a theater
okay if you remember that yeah
yeah i do it's like these suckers don't
know you can just stay at home and watch
it
jay no one's in the movie theaters
anymore so it's like watching it in a
big
room in your house well in that case
let's go back to the theater all right
you want to see black widow
sure let's go to the theater and watch
black widow
you don't know everything about me
i've lived a lot of lives
girls get it done well
girls and david harbor get it done
finally
the first marvel movie focusing on a
female character's backstory
good thing they waited until after she
died
in black widow and in case you're
confused this movie takes place
right after civil war but before
infinity war
scarlett johansson plays super secret
uninjurable
natasha romanov with the help from her
non-family
she's on a quest to kill movie producer
martin scorsese
in his floating movie studio in the sky
also
black widow has a sister the girl from
that movie where she pouts what's it
called
[Laughter]
also black widow has a sister or not a
sister a fake sister
it's a girl from midsummer they have
adventures she never gets injured either
now that's a strong female character
so jay we finally have another
marvel movie yeah it's been a long time
it's been since spider-man
home far from home from far from home
that was the nice little vacation for
marvel right right
there's marvel on tv but we'll talk
about that sure but we haven't had a big
marvel feature film
in several years i think this movie
was probably shot four years ago i think
it was supposed to come out in
20 [ __ ] 19.
it's supposed to be the first marvel
movie actually the very first one
uh they said let's go with robert downey
jr as our start instead of this thing
no uh this was supposed to come out i
think
well during the pandemic of course but i
thought it was like
very early in the pandemic like oh yeah
yeah and then it got pushed to like
summer and then they said november
and then yeah now here we are july
of 2021 so that means this was probably
shot in
2019-2018 oh my god
all the previz action sequences were
already assembled before they even had a
script
in 2017 or a director or a director
writer which is a real thing by the way
i don't know how widely known that is
but it's very uh obvious in some of
these marvel movies that
yeah the action scenes are already in in
in the works they have their effects
artists working on them before they even
have a
a script or a filmmaker to direct the
actors in the scenes
that don't involve the special effects
right
which this may be this movie may be the
the strongest example of that
that that shift from hey here are actors
delivering
lines of dialogue and information and
then here's ridiculous
ugly bad action scenes oh yeah because
some of the scenes
with actors saying things to each other
and rooms in this is pretty
okay i i have to say and maybe it's the
fact that
i'm i'm an adult but those are the parts
that i like the most
uh i didn't really like this movie i
didn't really
hate this movie there's a big shrug of a
movie and and
yeah also the fact that it was made is a
big like why
now i mean you have a movie with a
character that died in end game
so it's like well if we want to make a
scarlett johansson vehicle it has to
take place in the past
which means that it has to be which is i
guess kind of a positive that it's so
self-contained
compared to some of these other movies
it's just a little story
about family and about getting the band
back together to take down
uh a sex trafficker basically yeah
the the metaphor is not so subtle
but we'll talk about that uh but i
wanted to
point on that uh yes the the this is
after
uh black widow's character has died she
dies in
endgame but it it can't be
an origin story unless uh
you got a d age scarlett johansson not
that she doesn't look old or anything
i'm just saying like
an origin story would be a long time ago
so she have to be like teenager
right and so you really couldn't do an
origin story
and i think we kind of got that in age
of ultron
vague memories i haven't seen that since
it came out yeah there's a lot of stuff
about her backstory and i think people
were pissed off about
the fact that she was so upset that she
couldn't have children in that movie
in the red room where i was trained
they sterilize you you still think
you're the only monster on the team
which is weird people were upset about
that in that movie i think it was
partially because it was like oh that
doesn't make her less of a woman and the
movie's trying to treat it as if she's
less of a woman
because she can't have kids there's some
controversy vague in the back of my mind
when that movie came out
this movie they bring it up again that
her sister played by frowny face
also had her uterus ripped out of her
and they played as a joke
and it was really weird and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs they
just get
right in there okay so you can okay you
don't
have to get so clinical and nasty why
did they do that
anybody out there in comic book land you
know it's efficient
one less thing to worry about
the one thing that might matter more
than a mission
they just get right in there and they
chop them all away
everything goes okay um but what i was
saying so they can't do an origin story
they can't
do something that takes place post end
game in
you know that world so it's like okay we
got to take
a little sliver of a story and it sort
of is an origin story because they
they show her and uh francis hoog
how do you say your name poog pew i
think pew like the hsi or the g asylum
um uh they show their backstory and
that's we got some more information like
further back
um but the whole the whole premise of
the movie
kind of is self-defeating because it
takes the uniqueness away from
the black widow's character oh yeah
she's
becomes almost like a side character in
this movie she's the least interesting
character
yeah the most interesting character was
david harbor david harbor
and florence pugh their scenes together
they were good yeah we're good
they didn't develop i don't know they
didn't develop either of them
very much no what they had to work with
was good yeah
they have some nice little moments uh
when they're all reunited
uh when they're in the bedroom together
and they kind of reconnect so yeah
it's like oh hey look a scene with
actors emoting
this is nice to me
to me you were everything
i keep wanting to say scarlet witch much
more interesting characters scarlett
johansson
aka black widow uh is
very like emotionally closed off
where you know they had that scene at
the dinner table where they're all like
like reminiscing or something and she's
like shut up you're you're
a fraud you're a failure but you're
you're
an [ __ ] let's just get to work you
know that's kind of her character
so having her do some of the stuff that
midsummer did would have been nice sure
uh but i don't know whatever but she
still has to be the same character after
this movie as she was before it because
those other movies exist already yes
yes but to your point that they couldn't
make the set after
end game because she dies in that i
wanted to point out that that [ __ ] don't
matter anymore
that's true uh which is a problem i have
increasing problem with these marvel
movies is that
there are no emotional stakes because
characters can die and then they just
bring them back
loki's died twice he has his own tv show
now
vision died he's back that's true none
of this [ __ ]
sticks which makes it not matter which
makes me not care
they're not technically back they're
back but like the loki's story takes
place
in that moment of time travel or
something yeah
it was set up an end game but it's still
like loki still is dead
technically i'm not watching the loki
show so i don't know what happens there
yeah
i watched the first episode and i noped
right out of there
[Music]
uh okay so here's where we have the
hypothetical what do you do
i would speculate you you said why now
why would you make a black widow movie
you know um
i'm i would guess maybe it's a contract
thing
they had scarlet for one more film and
didn't want to waste it
have they done uh is this the first
solo female marvel led movie
no mike oh god forgetting about
everybody's favorite film captain marvel
i totally did i think everybody did
i guess i just don't see her as a lady
that's here as a
as a non-sexual entity from space
who flies around and punches people she
was a
human what happened to that movie this
would be a
a fun trivia show what happened what
happened in captain marvel sure her iron
plane went so high up into the
atmosphere
uh space radiation or magic space
dust got into her spacecraft and then
she crashed yes
and then she realized she had
superpowers and then she became the most
powerful character in the mcu
so much so that they had to find ways to
keep her out of end game as much
as possible right because when she shows
up she could just end the whole thing
immediately
right which makes her boring characters
that can't be
hurt are boring black widow
is boring the movie
[Music]
i think i'm that part of my brain that
that goes oh gosh wouldn't
someone have a concussion or wouldn't
someone's
wrists have been broken or leg have been
broken like what that part with the car
oh the car like lands on a train and
flips over and explodes
and flies into a subway station
or the other part with the car when the
task masker task master
blows up her car she's like on the edge
of a bridge yeah
and the car flips over five times and
they cut to scarlett johansson in front
of a green screen going
ah
or the ending when she's falling the
ending is the worst thing about this
[ __ ]
ridiculous ridiculous and that's what i
say the contrast between that and just
like
normal scenes with characters and people
in them
right is is so dramatic in this the only
movie i can think of that's similar is
maybe black panther
where it's like oh there's character
drama there's interesting stuff going on
and then everybody fights on cgi rhinos
at the end
[Music]
[Applause]
and that's why early on i was thinking
like the first kind of big action the
way this movie opens is they're
they're fleeing the country their fake
family is fleeing the country and then
david harbor's on like the wing of the
plane
and it's relatively simple and i was
like oh this isn't bad
yeah and then the movie kind of goes on
and has a very sort of like i don't know
jason bourne kind of feel to it this is
surprisingly
impossible mission impossible i was
thinking of during the car chase
like i think you even pointed out
there's that first car chase oh he's
like oh
now we're turning this over to the
second unit to film all the car stuff
yeah scarlett johansson's in front of a
green screen going like this they're
they're on a motorcycle in
budapest i think yeah i don't know and
they're on the motorcycle for like
one-tenth of the sequence the motorcycle
falls over and then
they go let's run and get into into the
sky oh my lord
and i just run and get in a car we
cynically joked
so they could take the two actresses and
put them in a car on a soundstage
and then they could they don't have to
have them in hungary anymore yeah
they don't have to have them on the
second unit comes in
they got two look-alike stunt drivers to
drive around the little blue car and
they filmed a bunch of shots
and scarlett johansson's driving in a
soap opera
it looks like psycho from 1960 yeah
[Laughter]
but yeah i think just the action stuff i
was just like
bored with uh and then i
kind of struggled to to make sense of
what the movie what what the purpose was
and what i was expecting was a more
mission impossible-esque
storyline where we didn't need the big
oh god the big floating
fortress at the end that super villain
and the silly the silly plot
the silly plot that that
reduces her character's uniqueness uh i
didn't like because i
the only thing i knew about black widow
i i don't really remember
all these things black widow
is was a lady who this is this is my
version of black widow this is this is
what i think of her character in my head
sure and i don't know what's going on
you're representing the average movie
goer not the die hard mcu
sure average moviegoer or just kind of
how i interpret her character regardless
of what
facts they've thrown at me regardless of
reality
this is how i interpret uh a black
widow's character
okay natasha romanoff uh
grew up on the mean streets of russia
and she had a tough upbringing so
she decided to join the russian
uh i don't know kgb or whatever
and she became really good at
uh beating people up she has a a
uncanny ability to fight really really
well
and she's really good at spy [ __ ] and
then
after years of doing dirty work she says
i feel bad about this and i'm going to
be an avenger
end of story i'm pretty sure that's what
it was yeah i think she was a killer
right she was killing assassins she was
an assassin
right right um and that was it and then
in this film we have
martin scorsese i don't know you don't
you disagree
i didn't think he looked like martin's
christmas he's got the same glasses in
the same hair
style and he kind of looks he looks
younger and fatter
[Music]
so bad guy uses implanted devices
through his ipad to control
thousands of women all over the world
uh to do his evil biddings and you know
we will mention this very briefly
because there's obvious
metaphor here for i don't know what
whatever modern day
problems there are sex trafficking the
hollywood studio
system that's why you keep calling
martin scorsese but he's clearly a
harvey weinstein
that's more what he looks like martin
scorsese it's confusing because they're
both involved with movies he looks like
martin scorsese but he's clearly a
harvey weinstein and and even his office
in the giant floating spaceship
is like this kind of vintagey art deco
old hollywood looking
uh movie producer office with like the
the hardwood floors and the
the chandeliers and it's a very like out
of place was there a big
couch i'm sure there was a big couch
this is a giant sign this is casting
but um but he sees women as
commodity and and so there's some sort
of social commentary there
um but why why
if you're gonna have armies of assassins
why women so that you can
rescue the women at the end so girls can
get it done
i mean like wouldn't you want i mean not
to be i'm not being sexist but
wouldn't you want men to be your lethal
assassins
i'm trying to think if they explain this
in the movie there may be some line
about it
using the only natural resource that the
world has too much of
girls
i mean you don't have to perform
hysterectomies on all the men
yeah i know girls get it done
i mean maybe women make better assassins
maybe they could blend in
but they all wear like a uniform what do
assassins wear uniforms
uh it would be neater if like
he he would turn things off and on like
because he remember that part where he
made one kill herself
yeah because she became exposed to the
gas he's like she go
he's got his ipad he hits terminate you
know and then she kills herself
but uh i think all the the widows live
on the magical flying space castle
and then he sends them down in their
black widow outfits to go
assassinate they're saying if they just
walked around like normal people they
weren't even aware they were
assassinated
that's the plot of the first naked gun
movie oh you're right
yeah reggie jackson i must kill
the queen he tries to kill the queen of
england yes
that's movies leslie nielsen saves her
and ends up
on top of her with her legs
you're right that is the plot of the
first naked gun movie but that what a
great premise
oh like yeah an assassin that doesn't
know they're just
yeah he hits that button and and uh
it's almost like it's an extension of
his super soldier project to
you know share okay but it falls in line
with the metaphor of like
controlling the women like you know he's
like a pimp essentially like
yeah you're just gonna do whatever i say
and i have you under my full control not
not being like a smarter super villain
would be more
subtle secretive and less obvious
like having an army of brain dead women
that
you can control with your ipad to do
your biddings
but more so like have just
people not even just women just people
who have
a secret chip in them that are near
targets that you might
you know make money assassinating yeah
oh that you know this guy's really good
i'm going to hit this button
and he's going to assassinate some
dictator or queen of england the queen
of england right
during the baseball game and then maybe
maybe scarlet witch or
with scarlett johansson has to go and
find them before
they they get their targets you know
sure and
and each each one along the line that
she finds gets her closer
gives her more information on how to
find him yeah like a spy movie
as opposed to just like a movie like oh
like a movie like
as opposed to going to rachel ice and
just saying where's the guy where's the
guy
oh he's here oh i'll take you to him
okay oh yeah remember that part
where where her mother was like i've
already contacted the red room
and they're coming cut to a different
scene and then
uh and then they they ripped their faces
off and they've swapped roles again
mission impossible style mission
embossing
but then they tell us in a flashback
what happened i'm like
i figured that out on my own yeah i get
it
scarlett johansson was in on it yeah
yeah the
and on the whole thing thanks for
telling me can you make this a little
a little more like give me a little more
credit i guess you're making this
for six year olds but you're also making
this for
40 year old fat guys yeah so i i guess
you got to explain it to both
i don't i just don't know but yeah yeah
having her go around the world and the
next assassination is going to occur
here i know because
i found this information out we're going
to stop this
assassin who's the secret widow
i guess a widow has to be a female
but when just why don't [ __ ] ever be
black widow she's the only black widow
that's her name that's her code name
yeah that's what it's always been just
cause i know
secret assassins they don't have to be
called widows
they don't have to look like her and
wear the same outfit and and be part of
an army that does
exactly everything that she does but her
and
uh her father her and her father were
the red guardian just go around the
world
he wants to wear his outfit and she
keeps saying no it's too obvious
embarrassing me in public yeah yeah
that'd be fun instead of natasha
going and living in a trailer in the
middle of a field
wouldn't it have been fun if the first
act of the movie was
her uh a fish out of water stuff
she she's she's she's hiding from
uh being caught because she's like on
the
she violated the circovia accords or
whatever and so now that
she's been tracked by william hurt and
shields yeah um so
but she pays some guy who gets her
things to get her
a a trailer in the middle of a field in
like norway or something uh it wouldn't
have been fun
if she went like like dyed her hair and
uh you know changed her appearance and
then like had to work
as like a waitress at like a denny's or
something
in florida in florida yes yes
that would be and she has like she tries
to practice this like really terrible
southern accent
and she just keeps messing it up and uh
you know maybe she stops a small
small town bank heist while she's like
just
she's depositing the money for like the
diner that she works at
and someone tries to rob the bank and
then she's like [ __ ]
[ __ ] you know why here we go again an
avenger i gotta intervene and she's just
but it's on security cameras that ain't
no
waitress thus the plot
begins you know but yeah but you have a
handful of fun fish out of water scenes
where where
she's gotta she's gotta go undercover
basically she
she meets up with her family red
guardian
they go on an adventure they discover
this network of
spies that are being used as secret
assassins
and then she wants to get back at the
the big guy
yeah i guess you have to have a villain
a main villain you gotta have a villain
you have to have a secondary villain
yeah but but he he doesn't have to live
in a flying fortress and a silly plot
involving
brainwashing gas yes he does mike how
old are you supposed to take a plot
about sex trafficking seriously
i like david harbour he is the uh the
red guardian
like that that whole premise was kind of
fun like
soviet era like super soldier kind of
the
uh wishes he was a captain america type
he's the
the guy that the soviets created to
combat captain america and then
the guy changed course with his like
super soldier project and he didn't want
him anymore so
he just put him in a prison and he could
probably escape but he just doesn't he's
enjoying his time there
arm wrestling people and then he gets
kind of like not
they rescue him from the prison he gets
called back to duty kind of and he wants
to put on his uniform and
yeah i was really hoping for a chris
evans cameo
where he just pops in at the end and
then him and uh red guardian fight
just for a scene just give us that or
you've read guardian like fanboy out
over him or something
yeah yeah he doesn't want to fight him
yeah it turns out he he really is just
like he just admires him or something
there's a little twist on it
yeah um uh but
can't have that fun yeah which honestly
i was okay with
because at this point the marvel movies
have become such
so formulaic in terms of their their
tone it's like a factory at this point
well i would be okay with it if if
the premise was toned down and less
silly oh sure yeah the action was better
um yeah
and yeah but as a change of pace because
i was this is probably like the least
interested i've been in a marvel movie
uh because i i think we've mentioned
this before but
end game really it didn't feel like the
end of phase
three or whatever it felt like an end
like okay
you had 10 years you built this whole
thing up we're done now
and then this movie comes along and it's
sort of just like i don't know
an afterthought it's so weightless in
terms of its
use in the overall mcu
so it's like just like oh they're going
to be quippy and they'll be fun
cartoony action so the fact that it took
it more seriously early on i was like oh
okay
yeah i'm okay with this but then the
action got so ridiculous and stupid
that you can't connect with it anymore
yeah
the the certainly the first act was good
um but that
the whole plot the plot was so
like cartoony yeah had he
not had such a cartoonish master plan
or that i think that was just the big
thing for me was
yeah i i i wanted this
it should have been a a spy thriller
and or mission impossible ethan hunt
on a motorcycle in budapest right and
fighting guys
she doesn't really do much martial arts
like
that's that's her thing scarlett
johansson was done
she's like i don't want to i don't want
to rehearse all these stunts yeah maybe
it's not it's not flying through the sky
right black widow shouldn't fly through
the sky
but you have to put that in it's like
that struggle and you see it in the
movie
like we looked up the director because
like who made this
it didn't it's someone who has very few
credits
i did uh some some deep diving okay and
i found some interesting things out
okay i know she directed some movie like
a decade ago
and then she did episodes of a show
called smelf
that i think i think the creator that
show got cancelled
i think she turned out to have issues
with like
appropriateness on set i don't know the
details of it but but aside from that i
don't know who this lady is
but it seems like she was trying to make
a serious more kind of like ethan hunt
spy action movie
and then you have the the heads of
marvel saying well you got to put this
in there
you got to make it bigger i don't want
to
speak out of turn i don't want to
talk about things i don't know but i
would guess that they found this
director
via a computer algorithm
okay okay and i don't know anything
about the director personally or
their how they found her i just looked
on imdb
i did some imdb she did a movie
called lore
there's another movie called somersault
and another movie called the berlin
syndrome
now listen to some of these synopsises
okay and let me know if anything sounds
familiar somersault a young girl
flees her hometown and arrives in the
australian alps
where new experiences help her learn the
differences between sex and love
okay okay so the other movie's lower
uh this is on the poster it's the you
know tagline on the poster when your
life
is a lie who can you trust
sound familiar sure sure here's the
premise
as the allies sweep across germany laura
leads her siblings on a journey that
exposes them to the truth of their
parents belief
an encounter with a mysterious refugee
forces laura to rely on the person she's
always been taught to hate
okay berlin syndrome a title is a play
on stockholm syndrome a passionate
holiday romance leads to an obsessive
relationship
when australian photojournalist wakes up
one morning in a berlin apartment and is
unable to leave
so we got a lot of female-centric movies
about either being trapped or
self-discovery
or learning about their past siblings
parents stuff interesting they so they
scanned the script to black widow into a
computer
and it calculated who had made movies
with the closest elements and they're
like boop
yes this lady that's what it feels like
sure because because this lady is not
on the major radar well it's there's the
two
the hollywood studio system yeah there's
the two type of directors that do these
movies which is the
the indie director who made one small
movie that the studio scoops up
to make a huge movie so that they can
exploit them
and get them to do whatever they want or
you have an established director like uh
can you believe [ __ ] kenneth branagh
directed a thor movie that feels like a
million years ago
right right um so that's it so yeah this
random
you know nothing against her i haven't
seen her other movies but it does seem
like a
where did this come from kind of choice
right and you're right
the i doubt they they physically took
the script
no they didn't into a machine they put
it into their top secret disney computer
maybe they've an android like data
he just reads it uh the equivalent
thereof
maybe it's an app on like kevin feige's
cell phone
he just scans the script and it tells
it's his phone
and it's like connected and it comes up
with a list of directors because
all cynicism aside you have
great swaths of this movie that are
characters uh mother father
daughters they all are not a real family
but they were
and yeah they have to move they've
they're different stages of their lives
they reconnect later and they've all
changed and so
you know you want a director who would
know
how to handle that material with the
actors it makes total sense
sure i don't this lady is not on set
when motorcycles are being flung around
by wires and things are exploding it's
like we talked about ready player one
you're like
yeah steven spielberg was on set for two
days and then the rest of it was the
computer
uh people right it's just the reality of
things like i mean maybe she was
here and there i don't know well and the
frustrating part is that there's such a
dramatic like split between those two
elements
yeah where they almost feel like
different movies like
he may be a big old weirdo but god bless
tom cruise for his dedication to those
mission impossible movies
and having real stunts and having him
feel like a cohesive movie right
those mission impossible movies the
character
stuff blends seamlessly with the action
stuff
well they feel like they're made by a
filmmaker that's in control of the
project
and i don't know this is speculation too
but we noticed early on when florence
pugh
chases that girl down the alley [ __ ]
stabs her in the stomach
cuts her across the stomach and for a
split second he's like oh that's pretty
brutal for
a disney marvel movie but then there's
absolutely no blood
you see her on the ground and there's
like a rip in her shirt and her shirt
looks wet
and it's so bloodless where it's like it
takes you out of the movie
right if you're gonna do something like
that like not that it needs to be a
gorfest and obviously they wouldn't do
that but
you need to feel the weight of the
violence if that's what you're going for
yeah and if not don't put that in the
movie yeah
so and i don't know if that's like maybe
the director wanted to make it more
gritty since she has a history in more
kind of dramatic grittier films so what
you're saying is
in a movie about assassins show no
assassinations
yes yeah you can have them like looking
through their scopes and in a movie
where you're clearly
trying to like talk about sex
trafficking
remove the sex trafficking element as
much as possible
so it's cartoony and stupid which they
also do
so it's like there was probably at some
point a kernel of the idea for this
movie
was like a real movie and then it just
got stripped away
by by mickey mouse
which leads into a little bit of
something i've been noticing is like
nobody's talking about this movie the
way they were talking about captain
marvel a few years ago
that idea or wonder woman it's
empowering for women
i feel like no one's talking about that
with this movie maybe i'm wrong but i
haven't seen much of that
no i feel like either people are just
not that interested in a black widow
movie or
they've gotten tired of that grift that
that lie that
that attempt to guilt-trip you into
liking a mediocre movie
because it's supposed to be empowering
when it really isn't
because this movie isn't really it's not
about
sex trafficking or women being taken
advantage of it has like that fake
sheen of being about that but it's not
really
remember the part when she couldn't
punch him because of his pheromone
i'm so [ __ ] powerful i was literally
on the nose because she had to smash
your nose that's true
yeah to not smell the stinky movie
producer
so she could so she could uh kick his
ass or something
yes they they had some good working
ideas but didn't didn't go
you know full in on them or did it
incorrectly well and i understand
with like a disney marvel movie
following the avengers and following
spider-man like you can't get too dark
and gritty but if that's the case
do a completely different movie or
completely different scripts
do a different story yeah like just make
it some kind of like
because when you strip away the the the
real world aspects of it that
much yeah it becomes like weightless i
think
many episode ago i joked around about
the strong female character
and the movie industry's idea of that
it's
flying and landing on a the top of a
train and flipping off and exploding and
you know
and that's literally the ending of this
movie yeah it's
so ridiculous what a waste that you
focused on
the physicality part because she is
strong she's
she's got wolverine bones she's
she remembers she smashed she [ __ ]
smashed her nose
on the table and then reset it yep and
then like two scenes later she has
absolutely no blood anywhere on her face
and she got punched like five times in
the face yeah by
by marty scorsese
there's no bruising there's no blood
like like three scenes later in the same
sequence
she has no visible injuries
i don't know to me it's just tired that
i think that's why there's no traction
because i think people might have woken
up to the fact that
the grift is is over they can't be
suckered into
you know uh my daughter wants to be
black widow for halloween
i mean there's there's well that's the
the thing too is like we could talk
about how this movie isn't realistic in
terms of the action but a little kid
might not care about that
like a little kid just wants to see you
know a superhero beat people up
but a little kid's gonna be bored by
this movie there's there's it's too
too dry and serious for a kid and it's
too silly and stupid for adults
exactly it doesn't have that
marvel magical formula that that well
balanced
mostly all of the marvel movies are are
well balanced
but they they take themselves seriously
to
just that perfect point and then they
have a moment where they laugh at
themselves
and and or you know tongue-in-cheek
moments yeah and and though
that's what that's that magical
combination and this had a couple of
moments like that
i think the only standout thing is when
florence
pugh is making fun of
scarlett johansson's like superhero
action poses yeah
that was some cute banter it was funny
um it was
self-referential tongue-in-cheek and
then she does it later in the movie and
she's like no
no it's not for me it's weird and i'm
like okay that's that's that's that
marvel fun
yeah there's no kind of twist to the
story aside from the revelation of who
the taskmaster
is
right which i did some a tiny bit of
reading apparently people are upset
about that
it's the same with mandarin and iron man
3 where it's like i don't care if it's
like the comics it's at least an
interesting ripple in the story
it's something that happened yes
yes that's that's the the most
vague thing to a plot element yeah is
her
uh atonement for killing the girl she
lets the taskmaster out of the prison
and
uh yeah i'm gonna save you and at the
end she saves her
gives her the magic gas yeah i know your
face is [ __ ] up
but you're no longer a sex slave
you're no longer dressed like a gi joe
villain you're no longer
cobra commander
you no longer have to wear a biker
helmet and i could i could point you to
a
really good good plastic surgeon in
calabasas
[Music]
not that it wasn't before but more than
ever now it's
it's a brand i'm sure and that's it yeah
it's just there's no
solid direction there's no cohesion
there's no
sense of community or or unity
like we're leading up to the thanos
stuff it felt like everyone was on board
now it feels fractured yeah like okay
here it's a loki tv show here's a show
about this and here uh
it's like it's like current star wars
which i'm sure coincidentally is also
owned by disney
yeah and it's it it falls in line with
the landscape of
how entertainment is consumed yeah now
uh pre-pandemic pre-pandemic
everyone went to the movie theater to
watch avengers end game
yeah um and now it's watch it wherever
like you watch black widow at home the
same day
it's out in theaters some some movies
come out and they're in the theaters for
a month and then you could get it some
are
at the same times
it's just the and some people are
choosing to just watch shows
instead of movies altogether right
because most shows are better than most
movies though
right so it's falling in line with
consumerism and
the products people want some people
might want to show some people
want a movie so disney slash marvel they
have to produce both every now and then
put a movie out
continue on with shows so it just it's
sort of like a pick and choose of what
part of marvel of the marvel universe
you
want to watch before it was here's the
sequence of the universe as it unfolds
now let's just grab from wherever
right and consume which parts you want
and it feels like
less of uh we're all in this together
kind of thing and more of a just yeah
and i think that's
kind of how i'm responding to this black
widow thing where it's like
one it feels way too late yes way way
too late two it feels
pointless uh and overdone i
i don't think little kids will really be
super into this
and it's not smart enough for adults
daddy what's a hysterectomy
oh then you have to awkwardly explain
that to your kid in the middle of the
theater
there's some some fat guys eating
popcorn next to you
what an awkward night a daddy-daughter
date
oh yeah i'm explaining that [ __ ] so
that's when you just tell a lie
oh okay someone took her cat away
her cat was named uterus
[Laughter]
[Music]
i don't have a uterus
yeah i don't know i don't care if i
would recommend this movie or not
that's all i have to say about that okay
bye
bye bye-bye i'd recommend our version of
it just imagine a different movie in
your head
while you watch it just imagine
everything is different
pretend you're watching a different
movie watch something else go watch the
naked gun
that's a delightful film god bless
leslie nielsen
who would have thought that he made a
better avenger
scarlett johansson
[Laughter]
or black widow
can leslie nielsen be called the white
widower
right because he's got a widower is a
yeah
this is the male version of a widow yes
and he's got white hair
the white widower leslie nielsen can he
also be blind for no reason like his
character from mr magoo
yeah yes but he believed all sorts of
hilarious he'll wear that white
cat suit you know oh yeah she wears a
white cat yeah
and she'll wear the black one and
they'll team up yeah and black widow too
white widower
