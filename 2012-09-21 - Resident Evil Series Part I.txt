part-2 so with all these movies under
our belts we decided to see the fifth
movie Resident Evil retribution some
something happens and there's
retribution someone retribute s--
apparently apparently that's what
happens in the movie you remember
tenacious d come on babe rise and shine
let's get that beautiful ass out of bed
you want cereal
what's it taken please get a room sorry
none of this is real no not none of this
is real
so we should talk about the opening of
this movie which is the opening credits
sequence is in slow motion and reverse
and it's showing what happened after the
events of the fourth movie right like
directly after them where the ship is
being attacked by the umbrella
corporation so it's in slow motion
reverse and it goes on for a good five
six minutes something like that so that
happens and then there's the recap of
the previous four films and that's
another five six minutes or so maybe
even longer I don't know
and then we are treated to the slow-mo
reverse scene again in normal time
normal speed mmm and then Alice wakes up
and she's in a bed and she's in a little
suburban neighborhood and her house gets
attacked by zombies and it turns out
that that's a clone Alice and this is
like a test environment and then real
Alice wakes up so here we are like 20
minutes into the movie and absolutely
nothing of consequence has happened yet
nothing substantial a lot of false start
a lot of false starts a lot of people
and that's the whole series like either
people waking up and then something
happening to them and then waking up
somewhere else but this one took it to a
new level where's like constantly so
then the real Alice wakes up and she's
in some little room a little white room
or whatever and she walks out and then
she walks into Tokyo and right like a
Tokyo tests yeah essentially it feels
like a holodeck program yeah kind of
like that but it's like yeah just
constantly like wait you don't and now
we're here they're going into this room
and now we're here is just like yeah
yeah a lot of inconsequential stuff
especially the clone sequence in the
house which I kind of got this vibe like
um that someone somewhere said we have
to have like this this series is getting
too um cuz cuz really this is from what
one did this first one come out 2000
version came out 2002 as a 10 year old
series yeah which is which predates the
zombie revival which was started with
the Dawn of the Dead remake yeah that's
sure so I had I had this thought like
all these all the Resident Evil movies
sort of turned into this
like sci-fi weird schlock kind of stuff
and then someone says hey you know
zombies are back the Walking Dead is a
really popular TV show and we need a
scene that's like that yeah where
someone's fighting zombies in a house
setting in a suburban setting and games
driving around and I think that
motivation like made that scene end up
in the movie so you could throw in the
trailer and then you can you could kind
of pull off that vibe do you think Paul
Thomas oh my god I did it I did it do
you think Paul WS Anderson was told we
need a scene like something in the Dawn
of the Dead remake so he literally just
shot the Dawn of the Dead remake opening
sequence it's the exact same thread
reminds me yeah there's that same shot
to where she runs out of the house and
the camera follows her and kind of pans
around and you just see chaos and stuff
and then she gets in a car and runs and
then there's a accident and yeah it's
it's literally the same thing yeah um so
yeah copycats we need this we need that
the world is a deserted frozen wasteland
or whatever it is so we need scenes in
cities we need scenes and this well
let's come up with this completely
implausible and practical idea about the
umbrella corporation creating test
worlds all these memories were imprinted
my name is Alice how about Alice how
nice to see you again the hell is going
on here we have you under all control
they used me to perfect the virus
everyone I've ever known
everything I've ever done it's being
used against me essentially if you
haven't seen the movie they have these
bubbles or domes underground that are
basically like holodecks but they're not
Holograms what's a movie with Jim Carrey
in it Oh The Truman Show The Truman Show
fake fake envira fixable yeah several
blocks worth of Times Square yeah of
Tokyo yeah but the purpose of them as
stated in the movie is they they clone
human beings dump them into this test
environment in print them with memories
yeah of being people working in a city
and then unleash a virus to watch them
die and go crazy from the virus yeah
then they show that test footage of say
New York they show it to the Russians
and the Russians go wow look at that you
have a virus that makes people go crazy
we can use that as a weapon we'll buy it
from you then they show the Americans
the Moscow version and they buy it from
that and then vice versa and all over
the place and they make money um but the
impracticality of it is you're building
a replica of Times Square and you're you
have the ability to clone humans all of
which seems much more advantageous they
would spend more money than Russia would
spend on a virus yeah that can you could
dump ammonia into a water system and
kill a whole bunch of people like you
can clone humans how much more valuable
that is than a bio weapon yeah we've got
mustard gas throw mustard gas it's been
around since fucking first world war and
and and it's just an excuse to have
visuals yeah a series of neat
environments yeah Oh Moscow New York
here they are fighting zombies in Moscow
you're the air fine zone yeah whatever
but but you have to take that with a
grain of salt because you're watching
this movie and you're like this is the
most ridiculous thing that's really
stupid the logic of it just collapses in
on itself
taking manipulate we've taken over New
York Moscow Tokyo this is humanity's
last stab the beginning of the end
thank you good luck you'll need it I
have to say this is the first movie in
all five movies where I kind of liked
her character was their character well
they're not her character but um they
added in a little they did the the clone
sequence in the beginning where she
wakes up in bed and she has a happy
family yeah um it's it's this movie
ripped off Ripley Ripley's character a
lot because Ripley was a commercial
space freighter
worker and she didn't have time for a
family and so she sort of was lacking
all those things and then this movie
sort of apes that sort of steals that
where the Alice character whatever that
is wakes up and so it's like oh okay I
have a husband and a child and girls got
to go to school and she has a happy life
and then um well that clone character
dies but but she realizes like when the
daughter finds her the daughter thinks
she's her mother and and it does sort of
emulate or copy that Ripley Newt
relationship yeah where it sort of she
sort of takes on a motherhood role and
and adopts the daughter and wants to
protect her and and that has never
happened in the other films the other
films it's just her with a gun yeah and
so she sort of has this little girl with
her and that she wants to protect her
and she wants to save her and from a
completely flatline generic video game
character it was like oh yeah the
heartbeat on the on the thing like oh
she's a person yeah there's a little bit
of a little bit of something in inside
of her yeah and I thought oh that's nice
and then I was happy with that as
opposed to every other character in the
movie mmm because there's a group of
soldier guys that are going into this
facility to help rescue her right is
that what they're trying to they're paid
by someone to get Alice and the Chinese
girl out of the facility alive right
who's paying them how are they doing
this uh Walter Murdock okay but anyway
so this group comes in to try and save
them and
there is not even the most basic level
of characterization it's not like
there's because they're all these big
buff dudes and it's not like oh this is
the the funny one this is the the you
know no-nonsense one like there's
nothing they're just people they're just
actors in a scene that's an actor how do
you prepare for a Resident Evil movie
how do you get into character you
remember your lines and show up on time
you collect your paycheck
well movies are commercial business
essentially um there's artistry to them
on many levels but sometimes there isn't
yeah um just like the music industry you
know the oh sure of your new favorite
song um bye
oh the Taylor Swift Taylor Swift a
lyrical genius Jai's new favorite song
is by Taylor Swift and let's let's take
a listen to that
that is the equivalent of a Resident
Evil film in musical form much like the
Resident Evil movie speaks to socially
awkward fat bearded guys who like to see
violence the the Taylor Swift song
speaks to fourteen-year-old girls in
junior high who just broke up with their
boyfriend and want to say we are never
ever ever getting back together yeah
there is an audience and there is a
market and um and it is a product and
that's essentially what this is this
level of artistry three-percent umbrella
is more powerful than ever
we're the only ones can stop them
if we're gonna talk about the other
films I like the fifth one probably the
most uh which would you say that is
faint praise yeah yeah no I didn't mind
this movie that long yeah well it had a
neat premise like even though it didn't
make any sense but the idea of this
underground facility with all these
different you know sections like here's
a New York setting here's a you know a
Tokyo setting yeah I thought that was
neat I don't think they did enough with
it and I would say that with all these
movies to like the third one like post
apocalypse Mad Max world was Ami's okay
cool oh but nothing really had yes in
the movie a lot a lot of creative worlds
creative ideas and but not really
creative writing yeah um but but this
one the premise was needs more so than
the fourth one well the fourth one
didn't have a premise I don't even
remember it only wandered around and
then at the end they got on a boat yeah
but this one like it reminded me a lot
of aliens not just the Ripley Newt
analogy but but the whole like we're
going into this thing and we got to get
out before it blows up yeah which is
every rose in an evil movie actually but
but the whole idea they go they go to a
former Soviet Union area winter now
there's this massive concrete submarine
facility or they build nuclear subs and
this elevator with a sickle and Hammer
logo and it's a massive place oh yeah
neat stuff and the creature that that
brain creature the the monster that
looked like spawn yeah much
better-looking yeah especially me later
first movie yeah and so I got so cool
cool stuff happened in this movie but
yeah it needed more humanity and um and
really that's that's that's the easiest
part
hi waiting for a written invitation
sweet right the the pulling the two guns
out of her back thing hey how many times
did she do that in this movie was like
constantly
did she have guns or swords ship swords
in the third movie this one was all
about the guns
I liked when she had the sword when she
was hit people with the thordan third of
the gun and the gun that fired coined
their people the thorns whereas I way
you thought was cool was that we like
the Resident Evil movies unlike them I
like the part where she hits people with
the Thord and then tombi come at her and
the zombies are bad drive so she hits
people and with the thorn what would you
say if we were to make another Resident
Evil movie what would you like to see in
in that film I would like to see mill
your bitch go to outer space because the
umbrella corporation is doing
experiments on the moon okay and on
Venus and maila go of the gitch goes to
a science base on the moon and goes into
the center of the moon and there's
zombies everywhere zombies and they
through okay we'll keep this in mind
take note of this so zombies in space
through therefore more people on the
moon their undead inside their space
suit the meal I'll have to break their
their bubble but on their head with a
sword and when it breaks open the
zombies head blow old up
as far as a movie goes comedies a comedy
has to be funny
sure and if a comedy doesn't make you
laugh at all the whole time then it
fails at what it does the movie that we
saw called Jeff he who lives at home now
yeah promised to be a quirky a dramedy
and and it didn't deliver on anything it
delivered on irritating the shit up um
bad movie this movie promises people
fighting zombies and kicking ass and
action scenes Sam and to me it delivers
on that the the fourth one didn't the
third one didn't there were a long long
stretches of boring shit yeah and and
but this one as far as visuals and
constantly changing the scenes and
moving on and actions up it delivers so
I I think I might recommend it it's like
when you buy a vacuum cleaner I bet her
son Otis I got the show on your floor in
Resident Evil 5 sucks
but overall you could say without a
doubt that they are bad movies well that
killed some time but we really need to
get some customers yeah hey I wonder
whatever happened to the greatest
customer we've ever had
Anna Nicole Smith no I was talking about
mr. Plunkett Oh stupid casino taking all
my money Oh lousy Indians I'm gonna oh
my god
I crap my parents and also I've been
robbed
