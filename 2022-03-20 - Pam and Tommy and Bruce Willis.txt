half in the bag oh christ this is a waste of time
ah well we're back at the shop i'm mining for cryptocurrency oh
i hope this computer has enough cpu processing power
oh god i got one one billionth of a cent now if you'll excuse me i'll be mining
for cryptocurrency for the next 675 hours oh
maybe i could get a nicholsworth
what sorry you were saying oh i was just saying it's nice to be back at the vcr
repair shop that whole crazy adventure with mr plinkett is finally over after
two and a half years now we can get back to doing what we do best talking about new movies that
people are excited about i just watched another bruce willis movie me too
we need to talk to you about the four deck privacy
well we decided to dive back into bruce willis movies um
we're making art this show makes a dumpster fire look like citizen kane there's been some
developments since our first part that was only a month ago we did our bruce willis video
and in that time there's been two more bruce willis movies that have come out by the time i'm done editing this video
there's probably going to be three more who knows that's true um but there was also some other things that people were
starting to talk about that we figured we should do a little bit of an addendum to our bruce willis video and go into
that address it address it and we're not just going to do that so we're like yeah let's watch a couple more of these [ __ ] turkeys
why not why not let's see let's see what else is happening you only live once
why would you want to do anything else with your time this is a waste of time well we should
address the elephant in the room uh the rumors that no pun intended
oh hey uh the rumor that bruce willis may or may not have dementia
uh which is why he's doing all these movies really quickly to make a whole bunch of money so that he could
potentially retire or give it to his children i think is a part of it and that's it's
it's not been confirmed by anybody and it's just speculation that that's the thing is like now people are starting to
say it as if it's facts but the only source of it is like a couple of like rumors in like gossip rag type websites
yeah uh and probably spurned on by our video i think one was yeah i think there
might have been a little bit of talk about it before even before our video but it's all just well i heard or he
might have there's some there are some comments by people who worked on some of the sets maybe even a director who kind
of semi sort of confirmed it but you know that's someone's personal medical
situation so it's entirely up to them if they want to make it public we're not saying he is or isn't um
and hey people not wanting something to be public ties in with the other uh
i wanted to talk about celebrity a little celebrity personal life uh what they do and don't want made
available to the public there's a theme on this show uh i didn't even think about that until just now but but we
we've seen some some comments on our bruce willis fake movie factory episode
calling us monsters and calling us hitler and that we should burn in hell and that we
should kill ourselves because we made fun of bruce willis who at the time of our our taping we did
not know he may or may not have dementia if he does that's very sad
um uh but we were merely commenting on the fact that he's cranking out movies and
that they're bad movies yeah made a little bit of fun of bruce willis but it was more as we said in that video it
opened up to a larger situation of this as we called it the movie factory right these things that
just keep getting cranked out and that's that's more interesting than just the fact that bruce willis is
bored and disinterested and not good in them yeah i mean i i think bruce willis has
been bored and disinterested for a long time long before this and i think the big sticking point is us laughing at the
fact that he uses an earpiece to be fed lines which originally started from that
play he did the misery play yeah and so um you know we're calling him lazy for not
wanting bothering to read the script shows up for two days but really it's because he can't remember the lines well
you know well that's the thing is like if that's true and we don't want to dwell on it too much because it's none
of our business if he's not making it public it's nobody's business uh but if it is true then one that
puts him in a different light and you're like oh okay i guess i understand why you would just keep cranking these out
if you just want to make a bunch of money for your family before you completely call it quits because he gets
like a million dollars a day on these movies but if it's true that also makes the filmmakers and the production
company look so much worse where they're just kind of taking advantage of this person who isn't all
there a point on that a final point on that we'll wrap it up okay before we talk about the movies
because that's the fun part of the movies um i would agree with you that it's elder abuse if bruce willis was if
someone was he was holding a pen and he said where am i you know what what you're signing your receipt at the
restaurant mr willis oh let me hold your hand and guide your hand while you sign this contract that's
that says you'll appear in this film for one dollar you know i'm sure he has people
uh agents and family members that are saying yes he'll he will do this shoot for two days for two million dollars oh
yes he will um a stan lee situation yes and i want to
also mention i i had a little mini rant where i said it was just awful i would say i personally
wouldn't show up on a set making 99 of the budget for two days phoning it in not getting out of a chair
i said it would feel awful because you've got all these crew members around you that are working but
it is a this these movies exist and are created in a free market capitalist system where
bruce willis is paid that amount of money uh because he can be because he's bruce
willis and no one is forcing anyone to stand there and hold a boom mic for 50 bucks a day
uh at gunpoint you can choose to go into the movie business and and they maybe these people
that are working on the lower end of the the crew spectrum will eventually move up in the ladder and that's just how the business
works oh sure i'm not talking about the lower crew member well i i'm addressing my rant before and so bruce willis has a
name that name has value um you can say i worked on a bruce willis movie yeah yes p the the crew might not
get paid as much as him but his name has a value attached to it the movie production if they skimp on everything
but the above the line costs the bruce willis cost they skimp on everything
craft service they give people peanut butter and jelly sandwiches they use the worst plug-in visual effects the worst
locations this is shot against the green screen we don't care what it looks like and if the movie eeks out of profit
no one's to blame the only specter that looms above this whole system is
the law of diminishing returns yeah and whether or not eventually the bruce willis movies will run out of
steam at this moment no one has died uh people might be being treated shitty
maybe the they're not getting paid a lot yeah but it is what it is and eventually
the law of diminishing returns will will end these movies and bruce will have made
a nice 20 30 million dollars i mean i don't know how much money his kids need that's not my business
that's the end of that it turns out he does indeed have dementia
is up to him and his family whether or not he wants to cash in before he sits in the lazy boy and watches
football games matter of fact he was half in the bag over at the montello and
as we were talking uh off camera with our friend jack packard about this recently and all these movies that keep
coming out one every other week when bruce willis stops acting
whatever he decides that is no one is going to remember any of these movies all anyone's going to talk about is pulp
fiction die hard fifth element and these will have just been things that happened that
vanished forever right so let's keep talking about them oh yeah
yeah we both picked because there's two that have come out yeah so you watched one i watched the other and don't say we both
picked you picked gasoline allen you told me to watch the other well i picked gasoline alley because it's directed by my arch-nemesis edward john drake the
worst filmmaker of all time you know something you don't even know you know or somebody wants you to know something
uh gasoline alley despite having a very simple premise i had no [ __ ] clue what was going on
through the whole film it's set in la but it's very clearly not shot in l.a devon sawa owns a uh tattoo
parlor called gasoline alley and every time he goes outside his tattoo parlor you see like little main
street in in somewhere in georgia but it's supposed to be la the cobblestone streets it's like yeah like little shops
across the street southeast cobblestone i i don't know where it is but it's definitely not los angeles
right but beginning of the movie he's in a bar a woman comes up to him starts talking
to him turns out she's a prostitute and then we cut to the next day and she's been murdered along with two
other prostitutes and uh and there's uh the only evidence
at the scene of the crime is a lighter with his uh tattoo parlor's
uh company name on it like a like a promo the lighter it was found at the crime scene
what's your point so he's suspect number one and they've put all their faith in the fact that he definitely did it
just because there was a lighter at the scene of the crime sounds like veronica cause of death
apparent shock and loss of blood nice but the two cops there's really only one cop it's luke wilson
but his partner is bruce willis who comes and goes sporadically uh doesn't have a character he basically
just stands there while luke wilson says things and then goes yeah the old days yeah you told me about
you'd have just taken a telephone book to him now i gotta actually question people and go [ __ ] buy the book right
i guess i'll take care of this here you're gonna hit the game yeah if they don't beat them who can they be yeah
there's like a scene where all he says is yeah after every other line there's one point when he accidentally interrupts luke wilson taking a
telephone book to him now i gotta actually question people and go [ __ ] buy the book right he says yeah as luke
wilson still say this absolutely it's just in the movie um so they they uh they go to interrogate
devin sawa uh at his tattoo parlor and he says i don't know anything about
it and they say okay and they leave and then devin sawa takes it upon himself to go fine to the
real killer it sounds like it has a nice story to it well that's that's where the the sense ends because after that it's
scene after scene of devin sawwa going to a place either interrogating a person or getting
threatened by a person and then leaving the scene get the [ __ ] out of here
thanks that's the filler that's the filler there's lots and lots of talking every scene they just keep talking
but there's no continuity like the first time when luke wilson and bruce willis go to interrogate him he says they say
that bar you were hanging out at last night that's all the way on the other end of town why would you hang out there and he's like it's for sentimental
reasons my mom used to work there my mother used to work there okay behind the bar
nah not behind the bar huh the implication is she was a prostitute because that's a bar where a lot of prostitutes hang out at
next scene with luke wilson should have just told me your mom was a working gal why didn't you tell us your
mom was a prostitute at that bar which he literally explained to him in the previous scene which has nothing to
do with the murder case which then has nothing to do with anything sure um it's yeah i don't even know what's
happening after a while he just goes around and interrogates random people there's a car chase in the movie that is
the most boring car chase of all time it's just one car driving behind another one
they're not going fast they're not making sharp turns they're just driving can't go over 35 in atlanta georgia
so there's a state law it's also the sleepiest of all these movies we've done yeah not just in terms like bruce willis
performance especially like he's so disengaged but like the pacing of it is really slow
i think they're going for like a drive kind of thing like nicholas wanting reference movies have that sort of you know very
methodical pacing to what i'm going for is the key phrases going for it because there's lots of like neon lights and i
think that's like that mixed with like a film noir
it's not good and this is your buddy edward edward john jake the best thing i can
say for it is that there are no glaring technical errors
nobody smacks their microphone okay yeah yeah oh there is one part once
bruce willis realizes that the jig is up and they know that he's the killer he's leaving the police station and they come
out like hey stop we know you're the killer what you hurry phil
and he he shoots the other cop and he's like standing over him and his mouth is clearly moving but there's no audio
coming out why did bruce willis kill prostitutes i don't know maybe okay devin tower gave
him a a bad tattoo that's hey that's something you want to
hear he tattooed no regrets on his arm hitler loved dogs
devin saw was actually very good in this he's a professional he was good in that uh weird movie that we watched where oh
the phonetic where someone was stalking him yeah who's stalking him there's uh john travolta
moose is in the house moose is in the house this is a douche
watch out watch out yeah that was a good movie that's a that was like a brilliant movie
compared to these that's yeah that just feels like a weird unique vision by someone who kind of knows what
they're doing yeah but then makes bizarre decisions these movies are just like cobbled
together with movie cliches what can we do to get from one scene to the next what can we do to
get to the end as quickly as they get to the end that's true yeah yeah so he the first scene of the movie is
him talking to that prostitute and it cuts out in the middle of their conversation and then occasionally
throughout the movie we cut the flashbacks of more of their conversation what are the three words to ruin a man's
eagle is it in
but it doesn't add any new information to the movie it just cuts to it randomly and then the last scene of the movie he
kills bruce willis and that's there's like a big shootout with lots of cheap blood plug-in effects
so he kills bruce willis he sets him on fire um and then he starts to lock out of the
room and then we cut back to that conversation with the prostitute again and they repeat dialogue that we've
already heard earlier in the film and then it fades to black and then before the credits start
rolling the giant georgia logo comes up and takes up the entire screen really yeah that's at the bottom of the
it's usually at the very end but yeah before they even cut the credits i was i was so confused because like
that's the last like it's such a weird scene to end the movie on because there's no it's not like
you know where you cut to a scene that happened earlier but you get more information and it kind of re-contextualizes the movie it was just
more of their boring conversation it was funny yeah no because it's true i
bet i bet well do they need uh like an extra two minutes or something that could be
well my film was an hour and 45 minutes oh my god really yeah and uh
i would say i paid attention maybe 40 of the time you know something you don't even know
you know or somebody wants you to know something i can't believe people paid a bunch of [ __ ] either
do you have two pages of notes well this is oh one's for something else this this is okay i
i did a little work oh uh sort of um because i didn't recognize the
director he was not a a geezer teaser director uh
uh and so i did a little research not a research i copy pasted his biography from imdb because i i this had a
different feel than the other geezer teaser movies um so the director is a guy named wes
miller and this is his biography that i think he wrote himself is an upcoming filmmaking powerhouse he
doesn't come from the school of of a a film student
getting their first break by getting paid 150 dollars to direct the feature
is a bit of a different backstory okay an upcoming filmmaking powerhouse with a
dedication to exploring the ongoing social and cultural problems in america
oh he specializes in exploring pulpy slices of americana
violence miller was raised in memphis tennessee where he was a three-sport
athlete he attended college at lamb booth university
and was an all-conference cornerback uh his life's journey next took him to
law school oh after raising his son as a single father
and graduating towards the top of his law school class miller worked as a civil rights trial
lawyer and completely left the practice of law in 2015 and began completely
honing his skills as a visual storyteller
his 2018 release river runs red starring tay diggs george lopez and john cusack
john cusack's another one of those guys we haven't talked about right we'll call them redbox stars yeah he's in those geezer teasers has won numerous awards
including best dramatic film at the downtown los angeles film festival
i was like okay i looked this movie up and i looked at the imdb reviews
it has like a four out of ten and all of them are like zero or one there's a couple of tens mysterious tens in there
but they're all like this is terribly boring it sucks and blah blah blah that was the case with uh gasoline alley too
where it's all yeah like one two star reviews and then those occasional ten star ratings to kind of push it to the
just to keep it from being super low i guess yeah i mean that's what we did with space cop
oh remember we made a bunch of imdb accounts we weren't supposed to talk about that did i say i'll cut this part
i'll cut this out make sure that you cut this out okay i'll i'll double check the edit before i upload the video okay i'll
make sure that miller has developed an exciting body of work in a short time never a good sign to deliver films that
are commercial socially relevant and impactful that challenge both the eye
and the mind oh and how does the data die stack up in that department it's [ __ ] terrible
this guy this director was a athlete in college then became a lawyer and then at some point
decided to switch gears and make movies probably because he was a big fan of movies and he was a civil rights trial
lawyer so he he's got an angle there that he wants to explore in movies um
not a terrible like filmmaker um
but but clearly it's not something that he's good at
so that's why i wanted to highlight usually we don't go too much into the director's backgrounds but like with
some of these hacks the edward drake's of the world this guy stood out as being coming from a totally different
background yeah he didn't go to film school or work his way up productions yeah yeah and now the question is we do
know of one other lawyer filmmaker and that's john the heart of get even fame
how does he stack up to john de hart um
come on pretty baby let's do the shimmy slime he's he's much better than john de hart
okay nobody does the shimmy slides there's a lot of trap music oh um
but there's no shimmy slide and the guy isn't so full of himself that he wants to star
in the film he's not a black tank top okay kind of guy i think he's in his own mind trying to make movies with
legitimate political social messages in the form of action movies uh and he's sort oF
bad at it but sort of okay at it i mean compared to other bruce willis movies i've seen
it's not good but i think also too if i were to psychoanalyze him a bit
i think he he was probably a guy who really loved those kinds of movies and and he's jumping
a few steps ahead he he might have some personal funding some personal financial stakes
in this although when you start the movie like all the other bruce willis movies there are seven
or eight different logos that reminds me there was a new one at the beginning of my movie a new company highland film group i had
not seen them before in the other uh the other ones that's just a name for a guy who's investing money sure you got to
come up with another making a bruce willis movie i'll donate money to it 10 grand okay mr highland
uh well you have to form an llc to protect yourself reliably for when bruce willis falls off
the stage because how did that happen too who fell off the stage was that kelsey grammer
pretending i was a un interpreter
let me let me just tell you about the plot kevin dillon plays cop guy
swat team man in the beginning of the film there's a hostage situation at a school and the school is filled with
adults so i don't know what kind of school it is i didn't want to deal with hiring child actors it might have been
parenting yeah it might have been parent-teacher not i don't know i didn't know what was going on um but it's it's like it's this it's
this jumbled mess of of bad green screen
plug-in effects uh cgi this what's green screens uh oh god well
there's a there's a wonderful shot that that uh reveals kevin dillon's character
and the camera's coming through the back of a van they have the worst rear screen projections outside of cars okay i mean
i've seen some bad ones on tv shows but this it's like like the car is sitting still and the background's moving but
they have the shot that's kind of tunes yes yes it's worse than tootsies oh my god it looks like the car is in a
constant state of flipping over it's not great
so they fire like a missile into the school for no reason and blow it up and it doesn't look half bad but then
they're like going in and they're shooting people and there's blood squibs but then same time there looks like there's some practical
uh explosions and then um oh they they just coat the frame with
with like digital smoke and like particles like like
uh gravel flying through the air and it's really like obvious yeah so so it's just like every like cheapo film
uh making low budget thing is shoved into the opening and stock footage stock footage
plug-in effects bad green screen oh my god you know like oh it's all in there
the raid gets botched uh peop innocent people get shot uh and then i think kevin dillond
uh he gets demoted and it cuts to like you know six months later two years later
10 years later and he's chasing down one of his i think he's a parole officer now
he's chasing on one of his parole leaves and his parolee is getting roughed up by a gang member and kevin dillon ends up
shooting the gang member and it turns out the gang member is part of the posse of a bigger crime lord guy
oh and they get out of the car and they say white boy they say white boy
uh about 500 times in this movie [ __ ] out here white boy don't fight away boy
if we let these white boys live so you still trust these white boys i i was offended
i i would prefer they use the term cracker uh sure you know i was like can
you stop saying white boy can you say cracker i'm okay with it it's time to retire it's time to retire white boy say
cracker remove that from your vernacular you're pregnant
uh oh and so the premise of the movie is kevin dillon's wife who 20 years his junior of course of course finds out
she's pregnant and then bad cop guy even though the guy that kevin dillon
shot they pull up in like a like a like a black cadillac van you know they're bad crime guys yeah they all point guns
at kevin dillon this is where the movie starts and they say kevin dillon
uh you shot my guy well let's smoke this white boy and they're pointing the guns at them and
kevin dylan's like wait wait don't shoot me and then they're like take take uh bobby's gun the guy who got shot the
crimer and then he's like i got a better prize for you a white guy
shooting an unarmed black man oh okay and i'm like well he's a known
criminal maybe they just took his gun away there's probably security cameras everywhere and
he's like go and then he gets mike's social compensation social committee but kevin dillon gets in trouble with his uh
captain or whatever and he's like and so bruce willis is the police captain oh
and uh we got a we got a visit from our friend the year piece oh sure uh bruce willis yeah you don't
see that in my movie but that's because all he ever says is yeah yeah now i gotta act right yeah yeah
there's one particular part that i pointed out uh he's at bruce willis is doing a press conference and i think
it's in in the trailer and he's like i'm the police chief and in this city
i'm police chief bruce willis no no there's there's notable like pauses while he's waiting a lot of
people have died on my watch i will always bear that pain
every day when that pain drives me
to protect this city i'm gonna stop all the crime that's happening like there you
can tell it's not a dramatic beat it's and then he just kind of walks off and that's like his biggest line his other lines are just sort of like um but bruce
willis is at the the botched uh uh um hostage raid in the beginning
and he's just like looking at a screen somewhere like watching like but he's just like
doesn't know where he's supposed to know what he's doing but it turns out bruce willis is working with the bad guy if
you're trying to make a movie about like cop violence which it sounds like this kind of has a little bit of theme of that but no it's more like uh there
there's the movie is explained in a in a speech by the bad guy oh great this
country's built on [ __ ] crime [ __ ] settlers slavery thieves
falls family got rich for trading opium you know what they make with opium
heroin and then they put politicians in there to make it illegal to protect their wealth
these were humans that were harmful to other humans they were cheats
thieves criminals liars abusers
corruptors and they're like uh yes you're right but let's all shoot at each other and everyone shoots at each
other but the ending one of the characters had did a self-sacrifice thing so that everybody else could get away on a plane and escape the shooting
and he gets in like a like a toyota camry and he goes towards the police line
which includes bruce willis who is bad guy and they all bruce willis gives the
order to fire but bruce willis is nowhere near the set he's supposed to be standing there in front of all the cop
cars and and snipers and all that and he's the head of this whole thing yes they have this low angle shot of bruce
willis's face and he's like and he's just like looking and then they they have the the classic
body double and then he gives the puts the hand up and then they start shooting at the car and the car comes at bruce
willis and then it stops right in front of him and they just keep cutting to like an extreme close-up of bruce wilson
i think he looks sad
now i think is this the movie i remember somebody tweeted at us they made like a compilation of yeah it is
that way of bruce willis's lines seeming to be either 80-yard or
redone with like an ai voice thing you left a loose end you left a little
sand knowing what battles to fight that's critical knowing what battles to fight
and when to fight that's critical the theory okay stupid theory
but there's a part where i think it's when the wife she's sitting on the bathroom floor and
she does her uh pregnancy test and kevin dillon comes home it's like
when we introduce her and and he's talking and i thought it was bruce willis i know
baby i know can i come in until we see him walk in the bathroom
he sounds a lot like bruce willis and with just a little tweak to his voice
maybe they hired him because he sounds like bruce willis and they could loop lines for bruce willis
using kevin dylan he's gonna have to come in for looping anyway under the same contract that could be okay
just just oh do me do me uh do me a favor here do me
a favor we please we we we do me a kindness just humor me people take a
listen i don't know if i'm crazy sorry i'm late it's a long day
you still got your money why are you here well jay i think we're done talking about bruce willis movies
now yes and no to the internet we're not doing all the nicholas cage movies or all the john cusack movies we're not
doing any more bruce willis movies well definitely not more bruce willis movies but we mainly wanted to bring up the the
revelation of people saying that you know he might have some health issues we still don't know
but we said we decided we'd bring this back up and then close the book on bruce
willis movies you just did closing the book when there's a book in front of it i did i did do that again i closed my
fake book onto a real book okay well can you do it again pretend to close the book come on
no no with the real book you [ __ ] dummy
what are you talking about so we're going to close the book on the bruce willis movies
right jay oh you did it wrong is that that what
was that quite close we don't have time for another take let's keep moving flash forward to the year 3080 someone's
trying to repair a vcr they're missing that one crucial page the next step
they're like weird alien human hybrids they must repair this this yeah there's
something on the tape that they want to repair about how to like rejuvenate the earth and save the planet the tape called the saving the earth yeah so in
order to fix the vci then we must follow the next step
38 40. no
the earth is doomed and the planet explodes with a cheap plug-in effect
there you go directed by edward drake we just wrote a bruce wallace movie even
just around bruce willis my bruce wells must walk through the
the desert the wasteland of new york city and the year 3000 to find the missing page from
the vcr repair manual and he walks and he's like clearly green screened in this really terrible like
cgi new york city and he just and then every shot of him is low angled with just
nothing but blue sky above him going he cut through his double of course and you cut to some guy walking bald guy walking
he looks nothing like him and cuts a bruise yeah
hold up the alien laser guns they should let us make one of these movies the bcr how do we get in touch with that guy
what's his name the king of the geezer teasers yeah yeah yeah we got an idea it's called the last page we gotta get a
hold of them post up it's like mad max but for nerds who repair vcrs sure
there's two vcr repairmen named mike and jay the last on earth our great great
great great grandfathers ravi sierra repairman and we studied the the tomes
oh uh and the the the tape the the smithsonian has the one and only vcr tape
that that has a scientist who recorded the on his video camera in 1980 a weird
a weird equation right scientist on the tape is played by john cusack sure and
this weird equation that he videotaped himself writing on like a dry erase board um
is what will create this like this like chemical reaction that will that will eliminate all the
all the toxins in the and the earth's atmosphere yeah but it only exists on a video tape
and nobody knows how to play it and bruce willis is body double yes but they have a vcr
one vcr left and it's broken and the repair manual is missing the page that that is the key
instruction on how to fix that vcr it's a little convoluted but uh uh
we'll make sure that things happen in the movie yeah we'll have some twists and turns we'll have stuff happen yeah it'll be it's gonna be good the last
page i would say that if he sees you know uh our previous film space cop he might
turn us down for this job but we've seen his other movies so i don't think it matters if we can raise two million dollars we can shoot with bruce for 24
hours okay all we need are low angle shots of him looking around against the blue sky and we'll figure the rest out
later yeah the body double getting the fights all fights will be shot from behind him
and he'll go and then the body double punch people
it's gonna be good it's gonna be great it's gonna be great
well uh we're gonna talk about a tv show what
the hell is this it's all over town tv print radio there's a tape going around a pamela anderson let's see what we got
it's one of those things and this is why we're bringing this out because it was kind of a surprise in terms of the
quality of it because you hear like oh a mini series about
pamela anderson and tommy lee sex tape and you're just like yeah this is probably going to be trashy and lame
right it reminds me of those uh the the the guy who does the american horror story those kind of yes which i actually
like the american crime story i don't like american horror story i like american crime story sure for some
reason oj1 was fun yeah the over the topness the campiness for when you put it in a like a recreation of real world
situation it develops almost like a satirical quality that american horror
story doesn't have um and what we're talking about pam and tommy is not related to those but it
takes place in that same era but i wasn't planning on ever watching this i saw some like promo images from it and like i'm
not watching that it's like they're recreating actual photos of them like almost perfectly i was like i have no
reason to watch this but then i found out it was written by robert siegel who wrote uh the wrestler one of my favorite
movies and he also wrote a kind of undersea movie starring pat oswalt called big fam
and i was like okay well he's a good writer he used to write for the onion way back when back when the onion meant
something um and it's directed by the guy who directed i tonya which i thought was a
good movie yeah and this similar kind of like pop culture mid 90s event thing
have you seen itanya i have not it ends you know because that was another one of those big event things from that era and
it ends with that whole story is over and just on the tv is starting to be news about the oj
trial and you're like oh that's the next thing all these big 90s uh scandalous things
so you got a guy that worked for the onion satirical pop culture stuff and the director of itanya is like i'm gonna
give this a shot and i was shocked by how much i enjoyed it yeah this was probably one of my
favorite things i've watched so far this year uh and i'm and it goes along with a big list of tv
yeah now i know we weren't going to mention this
no one's watching it's fine i've been watching lots of tv and when
the batman came out with new batman
and i'm just like don't care yeah which is not a comment on the quality of the movie because we
haven't seen it we haven't seen it people get very uh defensive and offended when we just say i'm not
interested in something it's very weird there's certain big movies like that we should review or talk about or watch you
know but when it comes to some some things i'm just like no another batman yeah even if it's good i'm just not that
it could be really good i would rather see something new and different right and this definitely was yeah i mean
obviously it's a recreation of an actual event but it's told in an interesting way
it covers a lot of different things and becomes about much bigger topics yes it's not just the
pam and tommy lee trashy sex tape biopic movie no it's it's it's sort of
like very heightened reality heightened comedic reality um and i don't really know that i didn't know the story behind
the pam and tommy's sex tape i've heard of it yeah i've never seen it i've heard of it and i remember it sort
of happening back then but well i remember it from like and it's brought up in the movie like late night talk
show jokes sure yeah that's where i know it from and then when you not re-contextualize it but when yoU
contextualize it with the fact that these were real people and you have jay leno making his stupid jokes it makes
you feel so bad for them well that's that's the the genius of the the way the show's put together is
is it it jumps back and forth between two different sides it's like a big
shakespearean tragedy like like it's like a big epic story yeah with with you
know the king and the queen and the court jester and and all these different tragic heroes and characters and
betrayals and and um and and what what i don't know what was
exactly 100 factually accurate i'm assuming a lot of it was but um
but you do have to watch these kind of things with that in mind yeah you don't don't watch it as if it's a documentary it's not a documentary
yeah because um i believe tommy lee was pretty spot on probably a giant [ __ ]
he was probably a giant [ __ ] um let's get to the overview uh seth rogen plays
a carpenter uh who was in a pornhub once who dated a porn actress yes yeah
friends in the porn industry friends of the porn industry but now he's working as a carpenter you know he's a sort of
everyday man and he's working on tommy lee's house building his bed and then tommy lee is
as a total [ __ ] to him and that's the first chapter that's the window we get is our our protagonist at the beginning
of this story is seth rogen you're on his side when it starts right when it starts you you like him a lot he's he's
he's treated so poorly by tommy lee uh almost comically
uh awfully treated that's when you say this is sort of like comedically heightened
yeah whether or not that's entirely true we held a shotgun to them and you know i
don't know but um it works for the story and then i'm like i was like oh no
they're gonna make me kind of like pam and tommy aren't they aren't they i guess that's important to
point out too is i i have no i don't care about either of them in real life in real life yeah um
even at the time like i know pamela anderson was a big star i never watched baywatch
um but i was aware of them of course yeah you're aware they're famous people and that's the thing is um there's a there's
a big obviously a big element of celebrity in this motley crew is past their prime this is
past the grunge revolution that's another aspect of the show yes fading stars and their careers declining yeah
pamela anderson and tommy lee's her attempts to advance in her career are thwarted by
the sex tape what's that like you know to have all that uh exposure
what's it like this is devastating to us
what so then seth rogen um decides to steal tommy lee's safe because he knows
he has a bunch of guns and money in it and get back at him the the reality is i
i highly doubt that the real life guy carried a safe out of a house by himself
i have no idea but the point is you know the premise of the show he finds the sex tape decides to start selling it making
copies and and then it just part partially from there yeah well partially to make money but also as like
a [ __ ] you to tommy lee oh yeah um he wants revenge he wants revenge and then what becomes a bigger part of the show
is he absolutely no thought into how that would affect the other person in the tape which is pamela anderson yes um and
it does a great job of balancing out your sympathies for all these people yeah it's just ironic seth rogen's
character is he's a very into religions uh so rogan's character
justifies stealing the tape as a form of karma and universal balance he has some sort
of like logic in his head but like you said whatever he has to do to justify his shitty actions he doesn't think it
through and how it could cascade into all these problems and affect everybody's lives yeah um well and
that's that's another aspect of the show is uh we talk about like the grunge scene
taking over for the hair metal so this kind of changing of pop culture changing of of where things
are headed and so we hear we have analog versus digital we have the tape is a sex
tape it was a high eight i think but it gets transferred to vhs um and then
sold on the internet not not uploaded to the internet because you couldn't really do that this is the early days of the
internet so that's an aspect of it too eventually it gets to that eventually it gets to that towards the end but this
this idea that like yeah well we want to sell this how do we do it well they can't trace us if it's on the internet
and all that stuff uh i thought it was handled really well and then this idea of like ownership
where he seth rogen feels like he owns because he had the idea to sell the tape he stole the tape
he has the idea to sell it there's a bootlegger outside of tower records you look dude you have no right to be
selling these you are profiting off of somebody else's considerable risk and labor which is probably illegal but it's
definitely unethical get the [ __ ] out of here dog enjoy while it lasts this whole operation's getting
shut down man and he's like that's not yours it's mine it's like it's not yours you stole it that aspect of it uh
fair use before fair use was a thing because bob gucciane from penthouse
eventually gets a hold of the tape and it becomes a legal thing of like can he publish photos from it because it's already in the public
it's out there in the public and there's celebrities the judge doesn't quite know what the internet is yeah it's on the internet then it's public domain uh
yeah this this opens up like now you have so many cases of like celebrities where they're you know nude photos get
leaked and then once it's on the internet it's out there forever yeah and nobody in this really has an
understanding of that because it's so early into the changing of the guard yeah
from uh from the old days pre-internet hair metal days to the
internet 90s they dial up modems they go to the library they don't even
know how to look up the tape so they have to go to the library i like when i think it's nikki sixx is on the phone telling tommy lee how to type in a web
address yeah yeah no it's just three w's okay it's not w
just type it in like that w w full stop
it's a very funny show number one show limited series whatever the [ __ ] long
movie sure broken up into eight parts whatever um and at the same time it's very like
it's like a time capsule and encapsulates a little period of time when things were changing as you say um
in multiple different ways yeah um and it's also very like
uh very human uh because you feel bad for pamela i mean i don't know spoiler alert
uh i don't know should we have spoilers wow we're into it whatever some bad things happen to her as a result of
of the stress from this the sex tape and their lives sort of crumble they have this like whirlwind romance which is a
whole episode yeah well that's yeah the first episode is devoted to seth rogen's character the second is more about them
so that's this is like the perfect thing for a mini series yeah a limited series where
it's like you can really expand on all these different aspects of it right now too much to cram into a movie
uh but but eight episodes of a thing is it didn't feel like it was dragging no and that's
like it had everything it needed yeah some of these types of things feel like that where it's like this would probably work better it's just a movie a two-hour
movie also on hulu right now is the dropout about uh elizabeth holmes the theronos
lady the fraud and i've been i've watched a few episodes of that and that feels like this should be a two hour movie yeah
it's very social networky it reminded me as a social network but it's not done yet but that feels like this should be a movie not an ongoing thing because it's
starting to stretch starting to drag yeah so there's the the female angle from it should get tommy's like i'm on
the tape too oh yeah like it's different for you the the double standard of like yeah for you you come off cool because
of this i come across like a [ __ ] right that's how people are going to perceive me yeah yeah because it's true yeah and
and yeah they didn't really they introduced that and they addressed it but without yeah being too heavy-handed
with it they even manage just a bit to make you feel sort of bad
for tommy lee just a little bit yeah a little bit even though he is a gigantic prick which i guess leads into the
performances which is one of the [ __ ] highlights um sebastian stan right
winter soldier winter soldier him and lily james are pam and tommy lee i
didn't know it was sebastian stan until like halfway through the they completely disappear into these parts
like where they don't 100 look like the real people not that they have to but their performances are
so strong you forget that you're not watching i know the real people i know multiple times i was like every once in
a while i'd be pulled out of it was like oh that's right these are actors it manages to ride that delicate line
between completely making you believe that it's the real people but also in a heightened
reality yeah i could have used more there's the scene in the second episode where tommy lee is in the bathroom and
he's talking to his dick tommy tommy what you sound [ __ ] ridiculous how i feel
i'm in love bro and his dick is talking back to him and it's a little animatronic dick well it's
a big animatronic dick uh and i was like oh we're going into surreal territory but that's the only moment that really
does that that that part stuck out to me no pun intended as as being a little
like you either need to do more of that or you cut that part because it felt out of place because it was the only time yeah
uh yeah um it's like the the talking canopies and
i've never told anyone this before but i can suck my own dick
and i do it a lot you just you commit to it to that where
his penis is a character was constantly talking to him yeah or you don't do it at all and to me that that if i were to
have a flaw of this show that would probably be it it's only a flaw because it's just that one thing if they played
that up more and it became a regular thing where it's almost like you have the you know the angel and the devil
if the devil is his dick or something like but it's just that one scene it's really weird
it's out of place it's a little out of place but uh but would they have would have made it
without the stress of everything that happened with the sex tape i don't know that's why it's a tragedy
it's it's this grand grand epic tragedy of all these characters and and how one
little thing could just blow up so many different lives
they say that i don't have rights because i've spent my public life in a bathing suit it's funny
it's very engaging it's very energetic there's a lot of energy to it um
and it's interesting well it's technically minded when it needs to be like all the aspects of them
trying to figure out how to duplicate the tape how to get it out there like all these things that
like i don't know if you're into like vhs or that era of you know mailing out vhs oh yeah
things like like very specific things that interested me and then like the legal ads i was going to say the other flip side
of that is is the legal response yeah and the industry's response too yeah um
how how her career is changed because of it um you know they start turning to her
down for roles yeah her publicist is working with her to promote barbed wire and
everything kind of goes wrong her career nose diving
uh and and then tommy lee and they try to i love that scene where
they realize that the the um their record label electro records has
put bumped them down to studio b they've given studio third eye blind yeah yeah who the [ __ ]
are you guys it was a little if the movie at the movie if the series wasn't so
like dramatically heightened i would say this comes across silly but it kind of works where they're uh promoting their
new album and they're playing in the parking lot of tower records and we have all the grunge guys walking up and every
one of them is wearing a very different band shirt it's like i don't know sound garden pearl jam
yeah yeah they all have their own specifics like this is a little silly but for this it works it works yeah
so yeah this director is a knack for for making these heightened celebrity things without turning them
into farces or completely making fun of the people involved it's about celebrities like
we've talked about celebrities bruce willis pam and tommy were big celebrities
who are the celebrities now jay i want to say the age of the a-list celebrity
has has its golden age is over now the the stars what sells tickets is
the ip it's batman in terms of movies in terms of movies yeah right tv is just so
spread out that i don't even know where you begin but there's just so much good acting
in a lot of tv shows oh sure and movie i i've still i've predicted it before
and like a movie theaters will turn into disney entertainment events i think
we're pretty much there where the little tiny art house film is not going to play in a megaplex the megaplex
will be 20 giant screens that play nothing but spiderman
you stay at home and you watch [ __ ] on hulu hulu is really doubling down on original stuff did you hear
about like uh because hulu is the same as like 20th century fox which is owned by disney
and they're like putting out something like a dozen or 15 original movies direct to hulu
and it's all stuff that is like one of them is gonna be like a new alien movie so there's some of it that's like
name you know name recognition stuff but they know that it can't compete with a marvel
movie so it's like we'll release it to hulu and that's where that stuff is gonna live now the the mid to lower
budget studio stuff the things that don't cost 300 million dollars to make i don't have a fear of going to the movie
theaters because of covid i just don't want to go to the movie theaters yes i will wait until the batman comes on well
that's the other thing too is the window is shrunk so much between theater and uh vod stuff and i'm i'mg
enjoying shows yeah you can see stuff that it still takes a
chance like also speaking of sebastian stan another hulu thing there's a movie that came out called fresh have you heard of
this it'd be a great i watched it it'd be a great like 80 minute movie but unfortunately it's two hours but it's
very different structurally it's like 30 minutes into the movie before the title of the movie even comes on
and then because at that point the movie takes a drastic shift in tone and where the story goes and it's the kind of
thing that like that's not going to get a theatrical release anymore right but you put it on hulu yeah and i would i didn't think it was great
but i would rather you know focus my attention on watching that than seeing another bat and then
going to the theater and seeing a batman movie right that's going to be insanehalf in the bag oh christ this is a waste of time
