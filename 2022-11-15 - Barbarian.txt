Half in the Bag.
drink the red and you'll get dead
hello and welcome to this very special edition of half at the back where are we
we are between two worlds we are not on our half in the bag set but in both
realities we drink a New Glarus beer products available only in Wisconsin this is
natural tomorrow so on my radar Barbarian the name
appeared and I saw the poster and it was a red poster and a lady standing in a
doorway and the the word on the street was you gotta see this you gotta see
this and I was like okay what I had heard very early on was you got to go in
knowing nothing about it gets so crazy this is this year's malignant I saw that
and I was like oh so it's going to get really like because malignant is Bonkers and no Studio would ever make another
movie like that so that's what I kept hearing was going to it knowing nothing about it it gets crazy it gets crazy so
I didn't see it in theaters and somehow it was not spoiled for me that entire time it didn't get spoiled for me so I
went in completely blind and it didn't get that crazy but it was very well done
uh and it felt like a real movie which was exciting uh I I was expecting I I
also have been hearing things about the the terrifier 2 oh yes and and and it's like people are
throwing up and passing out well that's like a let's that's like a Gore movie I
saw the first one and I I hated it okay like when people talk about like people that don't like horror talk about horror
they're describing stuff like terrifier it's like oh there's no plot it's just nothing but Gore and that's what it is
it's like extreme Gore and so this terrifier too well I have no interest in
it it is interesting that a super low budget movie can get released as wide as
it has and through Word of Mouth do as well as it's done right because it's made like five times six times its
budget back yeah it's like yeah it's not for me but that's kind of interesting that's something that's just like it's
two and a half hours long of like Gore and it's a killer clown like I have no
interest but you know what it's something out of the box out of the ordinary that's doing well strangely
enough I saw a tweet from Mike Flanagan praising it who I think will be the last person on Earth to praise something like
that because he's doing the exact opposite he's doing the exact opposite he's making thoughtful creepy
atmospheric horror and not gorefest but uh he said something nice about it so I was like well it still doesn't make me
want to watch it because that's that's kind of what I was thinking about Barbarian because it's called Barbarian yeah and I thought and there's this
woman in a house and I'm like uh no it's a woman in a house movie I'm like is she gonna start getting [ __ ] tortured
like I hate that kind of stuff I don't watch I never watched any of those Saw movies yeah I like weird creepy
psychological horror I like um Gothic or I like stuff like that The Shining like
creepy movies I don't like torture porn I don't like violence I don't like Gore
it's just not fun to me yeah I just don't like it and I'm like oh is everyone's you got a superior interest
it's gonna [ __ ] blow your mind dude and I'm like she's just gonna get like
dismembered and raped and stabbed and other people are going to show up to the house to find her and there's going to
be some guy with the chains in the basement of stabbing her in the eyes and ripping her tonsils out
rip sticking ice picks in her in her eyeballs and I don't know making her
watch the Garbage Pail Kids movie gonna watch the Garbage Pail Kids movie and um the only thing I saw that I didn't
really spoil anything but I didn't watch the trailer me either and then I saw the
poster that's it which Georgina Campbell on it all red and it doesn't tell you
much I think she's British she was in the movie all my friends hate me oh I
remember you talking about that did you ever watch that I haven't watched it yet it's a really good movie yeah um and I was like I knew I would
recognize her from somewhere but um so and then I I seen a still image of
Justin Long driving in a convertible in the sunshine oh and I saw that and it
was like it was like an article like Barbarian who's chops the box office is
[ __ ] something or other and and it showed and it's Justin Long's performance in Barbarian something something so I'm like oh he's in
Barbarian the Mac guy hello I'm a Mac and I'm a PC
and that's all I knew it's like at some point I knew Justin long was going to show up in this movie and uh and it was
Justice abrupt as it is I was gonna say by the time you showed up did you forget that he was supposed to be in it yeah
what we don't want to spoil this although in my opinion they're not
anything really big to spoil well I guess if you go into it not knowing where it's going so we'll say first of
all that goes that goes for every movie I suppose like I really enjoy this process of never watching a trailer for
anything yeah but there's some movies that that take like a sharp turn right like oh I wouldn't like malignant I
would not have expected malignant to be what it is this movie not quite that extreme no um but you know it is like
the character herself you're sort of like slowly discovering uh you're going deeper literally and metaphorically into
what is going on in this house right so without spoilers we'll say we would recommend it it's very well made yes uh
not not perfect no I didn't love it as I think it was and it's not even the movie's fault but it was hyped up so
much where I was expecting more but what I got was still very good and satisfying
and well made especially for some someone a filmmaker that is not known for horror to make a horror movie that
puts so many other recent horror movies to shame and and that's the little caveat there is I think there there are
two audiences for this movie I think that they saw a different kind of movie than you and I may have saw because it's
a metaphorical social satire yeah uh in the style of Jordan peel
um yeah also a comedy guy that started making horror movies that's that's that's the bigger thing that's the
bigger discussion because because I really enjoyed the movie because I knew nothing about it and I enjoyed the
twists and turns it took um and I of course I have I have some reviews to share with you Jay oh I can't
wait um but I didn't I didn't like I wasn't Blown Away by it but I thought well that
was smart and and well crafted but at the same time a little on the nose
so we're going to talk about Barbarian now I guess uh spoilers we'll say spoilers because there's yeah there's
there's no reason to go into it any further without talking about where The Story Goes uh so barbarian's made by a
guy named Zach Gregor Krieger Gregor Krieger he was in the comedy troupe The Whitest Kids you know a thing that I
have never seen and I don't know anything about I've seen random skits by him they had a show on some cable network it's funny I watched uh if you
buy this movie I know it's on HBO Max but I bought it on iTunes and sometimes iTunes stuff comes with like bonus
material and so there's a little behind the scenes thing and he refers to this movie as his directorial debut which is
not true he directed a movie like 10 12 years ago with one of the other Whitest
Kids you know guys they co-directed it it's called Miss March it's like came at like the very tail end
of the American Pie gross out uh outrageous comedy era like the last gasp
of it and it's I want to say it's awful but it maybe if Freddy Got Fingered situation where they made the whole
movie like sarcastically in which case maybe there's more to it I'd have to go back and rewatch it what's the premise
like a centerfold comes to life or something no his the dude uh Zach
Krieger is the main character in it and he he's about to lose his virginity to his girlfriend on prom night but he he's
drunk and he falls down the stairs and he's unconscious for like four years he's in a coma and then when he wakes up
his girlfriend who was a virgin at the time is now like a big Playboy model okay and so he goes off to LA to the
Playboy Mansion to find his girlfriend and it's so outrageous but like I said it almost feels sarcastic
but it's but it was a gigantic flop and everybody hated it and so I I think
maybe he's using the excuse that he co-directed it as a way to kind of like this is my first movie barbarian's my
first directorial news that's fair I guess I don't mind sweeping some things under the rug I I respect that it's just funny
because he said that as immediately like wait you're forgetting about that terrible comedy you made
oh sweet God
in the van of Jordan peel here comes along Zach kreger craiger
um Jordan peel of course makes horror movies with uh social satire or social
message uh usually about race relations
um and this of course is a horror movie uh with messages of the metoo toxic men
toxic masculinity thick masculinity all these things that immediately if you say a movie's about it some people just roll
their eyes right to me it's not about what the movie's about so much as the way it
uh the way it's uh executed a little bit of gentrification too that plays into it which is my biggest hurdle and I
understand thematically why it's there but narratively it's hard to get past because she's like a you know a smart
young woman she comes to Detroit for a job interview why the [ __ ] would anybody look at a Google map and see this
neighborhood and rent an Airbnb there well we're too that that okay the one
star reviews that I scrolled through seem to have two complaints one characters do dumb things
um and and to me I was like I I don't quite see that no aside from getting
over her renting an Airbnb in this neighborhood right um but aside from that I think she's did
everything as smartly as she could I know and that's that's the process of the first like 30 40 minutes would you
mind pulling up your reservation confirmation just so I can see it in case I'm some kind of weirdos broken in
here to sleep all the characters are doing dumb things and I'm like okay plot holes uh people
love to use the word plot and then it was boring
boring not scary plot holes characters doing dumb things I'll read some of
these to you because it's very clear the the separation of like people on a
Conjuring movie people who want the terrifier or people
who want who or people who got it I necessarily didn't want this story
but I was like okay he's trying to do a thing yeah he's trying to have a message
movie and it was it to me a little too a little too on the nose but very
enjoyable but it doesn't have what pulls me out of a movie that has some sort of social message or whatever is when the
characters just start like preaching it to you yeah this movie it's all told through visuals and action of the
characters yeah [ __ ] so that's fine I have no problem with that I mean social
commentary isn't anything new to horror movies it's weird it should mostly have that because I thought about this movie
without any any subtext the girl goes on a job interview and ends up in an Airbnb
discovers a basement and there's a creepy lady old lady in the wall lady in the walls old lady in the wall
that's the old owner of the house maybe she didn't want to move out the Grandpa died an old lady didn't want to move out
so she's in the walls with Grandpa's bones there you go first first things we
see she gets out of uh an Uber taxi whatever it's raining it's dark she
finds her Airbnb she's fussing around with the key code somebody's there we're
immediately suspicious it's um Bill Skarsgard we're not suspicious because he's Pennywise we're suspicious because
there's a guy there yeah and and she's a woman who's all by herself so you you
put it yourself in her shoes and you're like and these like invites her in and and and really they go through all the
actual steps that grown adults would go through she's like well I'll just go back in my
car and try to find a hotel and he's like just come in it's raining you could wait and he's he's trying his hardest to
make her feel comfortable yes and not scared which almost makes him seem like more like oh he's trying too hard right
uh oh by the way I'm Keith Tess Tess that's a pretty name
thanks yeah you you're suspicious because there's a guy who's there and they it turns out they rented the place
from two different things um two different rental companies uh and you think like okay well he's he set
this up he's gonna he's gonna be creepy he's gonna do something and he knows that she's probably thinking about him
that way and he's clearly the the red herring and he's like oh they gave us this bottle of wine I didn't want to
open it when you weren't in the room because I didn't want you to think I was doing something to it yeah I thought you wouldn't want any if you didn't see me
open it so I waited and and she's wholly suspicious of him
she's interviewing for something kind of obscure she's interviewing with a documentary filmmaker who's making a
documentaries about like the Jazz scene in Detroit or something like that and he's like he's like oh I know about that
I've seen this documentary that this lady worked on before and she's like what what and I'm like was he stalking
it gets in your head was he stalking her ahead of time did he do research like what's going on she doesn't it's like
like a like a tug back and forth of how much you trust this guy as an audience member right as well as because you're
in her shoes basically and then we'll just jump right in it um because there's a story the plot with
the monster there's a rape monster yeah the product
of rape monster the monster isn't really a monster it's a product of it's It's it there's a CR there was a creepy guy in
the 80s who and and you know this is a little far-fetched but this kind of
weird stuff does happen 12 brothers and sisters were bound with chains and padlocks by their own parents our family
accused of locking their children in cages where they can't even stand up I've been kidnapped and I've been
missing for 10 years and I'm I'm here I'm free now uh he would kidnap women bring him down in his creepy basement
and rape them make babies with them keep babies in cages
crossbreed inbreed new babies and the end result is a giant
old lady naked naked woman that lives in the basement who's the the product of two generations of
inbreeding and living underground and never seeing the light of day and and she's awesome little results and this
goes into one of the themes of the movie of people turning turning the other cheek Turning Away ignoring the problem
because that's everyone's moving out of the neighborhood so it's like everybody's moving away so he's able to
the the Richard break is the actor's name I didn't know he was in the movie so it was exciting when he showed up because he's a good actor
um but using that to his Advantage this neighborhood kind of turning to [ __ ] yes he's using everybody leaving to his
advantage to take advantage of other people right and that's like one of the plot holes it's like Justin Long
apparently bought this house Justin Long plays a Hollywood actor who owns
property in Michigan and apparently Oliver and he's getting sued
uh by an actress for rape yeah uh he's lost big uh big articles coming out a
classic me too kind of situation right um and he's like oh God you know I gotta
sell I gotta pay legal fees so at some point he bought that house and renovated
it and and this it's part of multiple properties that he owns and rents for extra income uh I mean no idea that
Richard break and his uh women are living in the basement living under the basement yes because in
the basement it looks like a like a crudi old basement that they didn't renovate there's a secret rope that opens the Secret Door
and and you know I saw some comments we ever noticed that rope so at some point
the house got remodeled and the guy in the basement with the creepy rape monster didn't care
I don't they didn't live in underground it doesn't matter there's a whole setup down there he's got his little room with
his TV he's got some other way to get out he runs power down there I I don't know I don't know I should send buckets
who knows he didn't care that they renovated his old house yeah he didn't live there anymore he's living
underground living underground and which which just kind of implausible but for
the movie's purpose it's fine I'm okay with it because this reminded me of and this is becoming more of a trend with
movies like X and Pearl and this like for the longest time there's like the horror movies were either like big
Conjuring dumb obnoxious I just think at the end of conjuring too yeah everything's flying everywhere
dollars and of the Holy Spirit
movies like that or the the super uh minimalist a24 character-driven
atmospheric stuff and I like those um but with like Pearl and this it's
like movies coming back that are embracing the kind of absurdity that you can do in horror it's not realistic but
it's it's playing it straight it's like this movie reminding me of People Under the Stairs Wes Craven movie yeah very
similar with people yeah trapped in the basement where it's like this is our premise so we're just gonna go with it
well it's it's all shifted from the you know Paranormal Activity
Trend the Paranormal The Conjuring movies are out of gas now it's now it's the
Jordan peels social satire mixed with horror or like you said classy a24 movies like um I
don't know Saint Maude St Maude technically X and pearl or our a24 movies but they're
atypical for either they're yes they're not lamb yes lamb uh mid-summer
um oh God hereditary uh there's there's a lots of classy creepy horror yeah and
this this to me leans more on the Jordan peel I'm trying to say something through horror genre but still make it exciting
now that the message overpower but it's still entertaining yes and uh you know she she gets kidnapped by uh the ladies
old lady in the wall lady in the walls um who wants to feed feed her milk uh gross tip milk uh Luke Skywalker style
in the cage and um the interesting thing is she's
she's so like she's so guarded and mistrusting of Bill Skarsgard but when
the actual rapist and creep is in the cage with her she immediately trusts him
because they're in the same situation yeah which is kind of like reflective of
him and the actress they're in the same situation she has no
reason to trust Justin long because he's more of a stranger but because they're in the same situation
she's not questioning anything yeah when before she was um so that's clearly like well that's as
that's paralleling the work environment yeah Justin long and the actress worked
together they're in the same situation she didn't just meet him at a bar like you know what I mean who can you really
trust she put her trust in the wrong person yeah when she should have put it in Bill Skarsgard but she didn't trust
him because she thought she wasn't supposed to right she's getting all the uh the red flags
she's getting red flags or maybe seeing them when they're not really even there he was he was like stumbling over
himself to try to not have red flags yeah he's like
foreign
yeah so Justin Long shows up at the house season well that's I think that's important to point out is the structure
of the movie where it's like it goes along you're following the main character and it goes on for so long and
then just as things build to when everything is kind of revealed that there's a monster lady living in the
basement we hard cut to Justin Long driving in LA and it's so far removed
from everything we've been building up to since then it reminded me of uh everybody hates the
Kevin Smith movie Tusk which also has Justin Long in it but it does a really similar thing where Justin long is like
a similar type of [ __ ] character and it builds up the situation and then just
when everything is kind of revealed it cuts to almost a completely unrelated situation that happens like two or three
times in that movie and then that's what happens to this because then we could hold on Justin long for a while we're
like oh he owns that house and we get back to it yeah and then we cut to the Past what does this have to do I was
like I was like because the the movie up until that point was like it felt like a
horror movie it was raining and then oh yeah and I was like and then he's like cuts to him and he's like singing and
driving a sports car down the pch in California and I'm like I was like oh no did every it was
everything that we just watched like some kind of movie that that he's like producing and he's
gonna go drive and he's gonna go to a stage and the door is going to open and it's going to be like the set you know
like yeah that would have been obnoxious I was like no don't don't pull the rug out from under me that badly and then I
was like okay good and then it slowly gets back to it because I was like I'm liking this main character test I'm I'm
with her and then I was like don't make this all a movie I I thought that's what they were doing yeah but then we hope we
stay with him for a while and then we cut to the past and we we're with the the former owner of the house yes we see
all that stuff and right and there's also like drastic style changes that I liked too like all the upstairs stuff is
very sort of like simple camera movements and everything's very static everything underground is all like crazy
wide-angle lenses and lots more handheld stuff yeah a lot of wide-angle lens is in um
the old stuff too it's like four by three you know yeah distorted and weird and and that's another thing too it's
like I think it's it's just the message was it's like trust like it was It was
kind of telling it's like he's like the the man old man he's like creepy and
he's like uh oh he's like at like a like a pharmacy or something and
and then um the lady said can I help you with something and he was like I have
having a baby and and then she trusts him
what else do you need she she suddenly her attitude changes she's like oh come on I'll show you even
though he's asking for like rope and yes exactly and and and and she's like well you'll need diapers you'll need this and
and she's very like happy to help him and so it's like it comes down to like women and women
and men and when to when to trust them and when not to and then also very
obviously he puts on like a work uniform that says Carlos and he goes to some
young woman's house and he's like I'm from the I don't know power company or sewer company I he didn't he like didn't
even care yeah and she's yeah he's barely tried well you have a uniform on uh
I must trust you yeah come on in do what you need to do unlock the window in the
bathroom so you can sneak in later and kidnap and torture me in your dungeon
um she's so when and when not to trust someone whether or not you're in a weird
being Airbnb situation or you're on a movie set with a co-worker and people taking advantage of that trust and
people taking it back because I did like even though it's awful I did like towards the end where I was like is Justin Long going to have character
growth are they going to try and redeem him because he's awful uh but then yeah he goes right back to
his old ways after uh being put in a position where it's it's him or her oh
my God are you okay I'm so sorry I had no choice you know she was gonna kill us both and I had no time to think I
freaking panicked I didn't I didn't even let go you started to slip yes and just
throws her off that roof well he he poses the question aloud which again and
he's like and he's like am I a bad person or did am I a good person who just did a
bad thing see I didn't mind that being I I as far as like heavy-handedness goes because it's like he's trying to
convince himself that he's not a bad person right like he knows it he knows he's awful but he doesn't want to
confront that
all right this oh gross it's just amazing the amount of
people that didn't get what the movie is about now I'll share some of that with you
um I think yeah it's like a split audience yeah it's like it's like
half the audience just wants a monster in the basement attacking you yeah and some kind of resolution where you beat
it to death or set it on fire and and I appreciate the fact that it went for
something else yeah if Justin Long's character was a little more like less obvious like he's he's just a guy
who shows up he's a businessman or whatever and he gets a couple of cryptic phone calls from his wife and you know
cheating on me or something right yeah no they spell it out what kind of character he is pretty pretty spelled
out and bold print on the front page of a newspaper yeah what up [ __ ]
guess who's back in town and then he goes to the bar he looks up one of his old friends which makes sense why he has
property in Michigan he probably grew up there yeah and he's like hey buddy let's go out to the bar which is I think a
director came here that was yeah that was that crazy um and he's like he's like Dude tell me what really happened he's like okay man
this [ __ ] was dying and then you see like his real creepy interior and he's like sure At first she wasn't into it
but then she was like no but then then you know I kind of worked on it and she then she got into it yeah so it's true
and then um so it's like that's him that's his character
nice really ruining my career and reputation isn't nice either
all right I think I'm well within my rights to call her a [ __ ] [ __ ] and then he meets up with our heroine
and she's just like I gotta go back and save this guy he's you know but she goes
to the police for help they don't help her um and she has a connection with him and
wants to help him not in any clue what unwittingly can I
leave the guy in the past all the neighbors having no clue what's really going on yeah yeah and and
poor Bill Skarsgard she just didn't trust him because she was told or she thought she
shouldn't and she didn't have real good reason why but it's just it was it's an irony yeah it's it's uh
it's the meat of the movie the meat of the movie is not the monster in the
basement hey little girl
yeah I know and she also didn't trust the homeless man that was running at her
remember yeah he's like little girl this is a nice sound that comes back later she didn't stop he was there to give her
very good advice yeah everyone in this neighborhood knows about yeah the crazy lady that lives in the basement and her
her and she didn't do anything wrong that's the interesting part is the two
guys that she should have trusted she didn't because of some kind of
preconceived notion it's like there's a homeless man running at you screaming like your gut instinct is to run right
little girl and she should have stopped and said what what do you want you know what oh I wanted to like he was very
rougher on the edges and very very like scary and and then the cops don't
believe her um that's a whole other story it would have been a little too on the nose if
there were two white cops oh sure you know but one of them was black which was which was you know so it wasn't a race
thing it was more of just like a like we we don't believe you but we think
they're like are you on any medication or you know they just don't want to deal with it because it's all taking place in this shitty neighborhood that they don't
like going there's that again with the ignoring aspect of it and it's all wrapped up in a a fun and entertaining
movie which is the key right you don't feel like you're being preached Dad no no it definitely doesn't feel preachy
and it and it's uh it's exciting and it's you know and it's
I wouldn't say fun but um it's entertaining because they escape at the
end and the creatures chasing after them the down here yeah
no she can't get in here [ __ ] I've been living in this place more than 15 years and she ain't never came in this
[ __ ] it's memorable that's memorable yeah
it's no Miss March but you like this you can come and get
it foreign
is it time oh hell yeah I can't wait
yeah [ __ ] again it's worth pointing out that we're not Geniuses for getting the
movie and and I'm not necessarily making fun of people who didn't get it
but to me it's really surprising that that they mistook it for just a monster
in the walls horror movie okay I don't know uh this movie sucked LOL a waste of time
and totally misleading score the critics must be drunk people raiding
movies hey there this is an accurate review
no water or food and somehow an old lady has superpowers LOL terrible movie
should have been 20 this may be the worst movie I've seen in years I am a
huge movie person oh and go to the movies at least once per week
still makes him an expert I Rely heavily on Rotten Tomatoes reviews and in
general I respect movie critics and do read what they have to say barbarians this is their first mistake yeah
barbarian was so completely implausible ridiculous and just bad in a horrifying
way I'm not a huge fan of horror movies but this had many so many positive reviews I had to give it a chance I'm
wondering who these critics are I see that one of the main actors was also a
producer of this film and I suspect that there was some funny business and who was able to write a review for this
movie oh like friends of The Producers or insiders
there's no way this movie deserves 92 in Rotten Tomatoes I didn't like this movie therefore it
must be a conspiracy hiding information about this movie is probably a marketing Ploy it is dumb and
full of stereotypes it is bizarre that respected critics have called it smart and fresh
a massive plot hole gets some dumb people together they make more dumb decisions there is a
silly baddie the Baddie is a female with a sad origin the dumb people turn on each other
one critic said the plot makes you question who the real monster is um cool origin but it's the murderer
predictable storyline twists and turns of the movie are ordinary many movies
already has available on this plot performances of the actresses day by day
Hollywood movie standards are falling
flood sentence no punctuation anywhere great beginning bad development pathetic ending oh see
they wanted Phil Skarsgard to turn out to be a creepy weirdo that tortured her in the basement that's going to be my
obituary
ah no plot the script is just really a perfect
example of horrible writing in a script if that's what you call it aimless
stupid actions by the actors as normal people who just don't act like normal people none of their actions and
behaviors are remotely normal I mean Forrest Gump wouldn't have done what these people do honestly just
pathetically horrible writing worst film of 2022 I must be missing the point
is this satire is it meant to be funny that people are dumb enough to walk down massively long
stairs into the dark that's not the satire part
and plot holes were ridiculous basic questions are unanswered like how
did these quote barbarians exist without basic access to food and supplies
first 40 minutes of film are dragged around useless talking
Bill s has a useless role
it was quite important it's pretty important the acting is poor the story is clueless the monster is laughable
I don't know what the goal for this film was but to me it didn't deliver anything
good I feel like I wasted my life so boring see that's going to be my
obituary so many plot holes I love it that in the trailer people are screaming
they must have done one of those trailers where they show the audience reacting oh I haven't seen those as if
the movie was scary LOL I was almost screaming as well but from exhaustion
every anything will passed for a good movie on Rotten Tomatoes
every time I go to see a movie they like I wish I had not wasted my money they love nudity of gross fake women
they love that old lady monster nudity I love it I love it the all Critics on Rotten Tomatoes just love it that's why
they gave it a good review if it is disgusting they love it
again we laugh this could be English could not be this person's first language so let's just get that out of
there before all you come after us it's interesting how many people if they
don't like it they seem to take like personal offense to the fact that critics liked it right like who cares if
he didn't like it he didn't like it but it's almost I don't know if it's like a insecurity thing like
it's weird uh Justin long is a good actor who seemed to only receive good roles when he dated Drew Barrymore
honey you know he dated Drew Barrymore I know he had a pandemic but it should not give people a reason to make bad movies
going to the movies again until we have better choices to pick from
okay that's my favorite so far nice and simple to the point this movie was gone
awful I won't even spoil anything but I would never recommend this to anyone the CGI effects were a joke
was there any CGI I really don't think so maybe some of the gore I don't know absolutely the worst movie I've ever
seen oh it was neither scary or entertaining it was so lame and predictable I was bored
and annoyed within the first 10 minutes hmm uh then it got more boring and
predictable like all these things are wrong like like objectively I I I I I I mean
boring is subjective but I respect that people have their own opinion sure but
all this is wrong like it's not the best movie I've ever seen yeah I liked it a lot I didn't love it but
I can't say that it was boring yeah and predictable right the
only thing I can compare this movie to is a Geico Insurance commercial
but the commercial one of the ones with the cavemen but the commercial about actors and
horror movies making bad decisions was more original and entertaining now have
you ever seen that commercial I guess not there's like it's like the joke is
um there's a bunch of like teenagers in a car and the car won't start and they're like
um why don't we all wait in the car together and like no let's uh let's all split up no let's go in the barn with
all the chainsaws can't we just get in the running car
are you crazy let's hide behind the chainsaws smart hey
or something like that and they all go in the one spot and The Killers like he's just like rolling his eyes because
they're all doing making all the dumb horror movie decisions they're doing a dumb horror movie decisions and that is
the that is the Crux of it is that people are just like this is a this is a
horror movie and she's making decisions but they're not like horror movie decisions yeah I mean you know it's a
little unbelievable that she can't just get in her car and just drive 10 miles outside the city and find like a Holiday
Inn right like uh that would probably do that that would that would be an even less scary movie though if she did that
that would be a more boring that would be a more boring movie yeah so so they they do their best to like say that like
she can't really go anywhere it's a bad neighborhood it's raining uh you know I don't know
car could be out of gas I have [ __ ] who cares um that's not the important part right
and that is not a plot hole no the part the important part of thing
going on is that we're going through the process of whether or not you should trust Bill Skarsgard and why yeah she
should or shouldn't trust a stranger that's the point of the scene
that's I think that's our takeaway here is like the movie I was I was entertained
by it it took twists and turns it had a little message it had some fun scary
stuff weird weird plot developments it embraced the weird and I appreciate that
with uh modern horror movies because I feel like that went away for a while it's about the story and it's about how
you emotionally respond yeah to what's happening on the screen and how involved
you get um sure you don't want like some kind of batshit unrealistic kind of thing to
happen that doesn't make any sense yeah there's there's there's a little wiggle room
in most movies before you can call it a plot hole it's a plot hole
that the Garbage Pail Kids suddenly decided they know where all their friends are we
think they might be locked up somewhere in a really terrible place in the state
home for the ugly without any kind of foreknowledge sure
that's a plot of one there are plot holes in movies oh hell
yeah there's a movie with a point of view that executed it in an entertaining way it's a movie with a point of view that I
was trying to say something uh in my opinion a little too on the nose it could have done a little more subtly
um but uh I I appreciate a horror movie that's not just murders and a spooky
monster on the wall say say something but say it subtly
like like real good science fiction and horror should should fall in line with that too most art should most art should
say something unless it's the Garbage Pail Kids movie
so Jay would you recommend Barbarian I would I would do
it's free on HBO Max well it lasts oh yeah until David zasselhoff decides to
Accent I don't really care for movies or TV shows
what should I put on my new app HBO Discovery plus my app that's up
until now been dedicated to movies and TV shows hmm how about

just change he'll keep Barbarian but he'll change the name of it to like my my 500 pound Barbarian my 600 pound
dwarf everything will be like weight related yeah physical to the the naked lady in
the basement they'll just digitally make her fatter I just want to see fat people that can't get out of their bed gotta
