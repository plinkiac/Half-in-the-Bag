Half in the bag.
"Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?"
i can't believe we've been stuck here for over a month now
and i can't believe that the last movie we watched before all the streaming services went offline was money plane
what a waste
and even the fucking cable tv doesn't work
ever since china nuked all of our satellites
what a year
we can't even watch all the rioting that's happening in chicago live on tv anymore
i know i know
i'm very curious to see how much of portland oregon has burned down
well i'll tell you this
i'll never visit occupied territory formerly known as new york city ever again
jay did you ever think we'd be living in robocop 2
yes there is a silver lining to all this though
i mean at least the power grid is still on
we've got plenty of vhs tapes in the back to watch
and we've got grubhub
oh no
mike don't you remember
grubhub won't deliver here anymore after the last delivery driver got a hernia from carrying in all your food
oh that's right
if we get really desperate we could eat all the rats that live in the back of the shop
but with our luck the rats will have the bubonic plague
and the saddest thing is that my birthday came and went and nobody even noticed
you're wrong jay
i noticed
wait right here
what is this some sort of surprise
i got you a birthday cake
oh my god
wow
with candles and everything
although it's kind of sad i probably shouldn't blow them out you know
just in case i'm asymptomatic
no worries jay
i thought about that too
these are actually self-blow-outing birthday candles
oh so they're just like regular candles and you just wait for them to die out
no no no
they're e-candles
i paid a thousand dollars for
all these they have some kind of digital timer in them that knows when to blow out
they even have a little microphone in each one that can tell when you're done singing the happy birthday song
super advanced technology
very expensive
wow that's i i guess you never know what they're gonna come up with next
well it's good we got these face shields
where did you say you got these candles
i got them at the fireworks store
the guy there sold them to me for a special discount
it's funny
i didn't know they sold birthday candles at the fireworks store
i'm so stupid
speaking of stupid do you want to talk about money plane
sure
are you gonna eat that after discovering a mysterious artifact buried beneath the
lunar surface
mankind sets off on a quest to find its
origins
with the help from intelligent
supercomputer hal 9000
uh jay yes this is all your fault
you wanted to talk about money plane um
hey aqua splash was all your fault
so this is this is uh payback i guess is
this is this
is this officially desperate times
because
the only thing to watch is money plane
hey it's a new movie it's a new movie
that's out and you can watch it
so we watched it where it is they carry
up to a billion on board in crypto
and millions in cash i want you and your
crew
to take down the house
that's insane money playing while
watching it it starts off and
and i'm like oh my god this looks just
like
like a poorly done episode of uh like a
csi show or yeah it looks like a tv show
yeah and it feels like one
at first too
i i wouldn't agree to even talk about
this movie for a lot of reasons
because it's basically oh god it's
probably
on par or worse than uh an asylum movie
oh yeah yeah on par or worse um
and and i wouldn't we wouldn't review
just a random asylum movie because those
are cheap cash grabs but this one has a
little
more of an interesting uh twist to it
meaning the cast
the cast and the fact that it feels a
little more earnest than
an asylum movie yeah like those
sharknado movies are basically comedies
and they know it and the whole thing is
just a joke
this one they were trying to make a
michael bay action comedy
are you sure i'm pretty sure here's how
things are
and how things appear to be
is it normal for museum guards to have
machine guns we weren't there two days
ago when we did a recon
so the cast it's not just a bunch of
nobodies there's kelsey grammer
uh joey lawrence is in it
hair plugs sister hair plugs well
he was famous for uh he was the the dumb
brother on the show blossom
yeah and he was kind of known for having
his long thick hair
so that's got to be tough for him as
he's gotten older sure
getting those hair plugs yeah they're
pretty obvious it's like doll hair
yeah well also he's not the only
lawrence in the film
we have because i had heard about this
movie a little bit beforehand and i knew
that joey lawrence's brother directed it
and then matthew lawrence is his brother
who shows up in the movie with a comical
fake mustache and a cowboy hat
gotta folks deal me in
splendid now we have a game i was like
oh he must have directed this
but no there's a third lauren's and
that's the one that directed it joey
lawrence's
kid brother yes because he's a good
decade younger than joey lawrence yeah
yeah there's there's three of them
oldest is joey middle is matthew and
then the youngest is whatever his name
is uh i i guess this is news to me but i
guess all three of them were on a sitcom
at one point together
all all of them in one show can you
believe it it's called brotherly love
it likes the two seasons on some network
two seasons
i was gonna say is it the fastest show
ever canceled
i was not familiar with annie lawrence
other than joey lawrence we saw him at
comic-con one year
at chicago did we yeah i don't remember
that he was in the celebrity zoo
welcome to the celebrity zoo where
careers come to die
oh there's one of the one of the animals
in the celebrity zoo i have no memory of
him being there huh
where to begin money playing the premise
is
is awful it's the worst premise ever
um it's trying to be like a
ocean's 11 movie or a mission impossible
tom cruise kind of heist thriller yes
but
it it's like it's written by an 11 year
old
who doesn't understand anything about
heist movies
or planes or criminals
or gambling or gambling yeah or yeah
oh my god um oh thomas jane is also in
it
he is yeah who's who i didn't recognize
at first
he plays the friend of the the wrestler
the lead character i don't know what the
name is the character's name is jack
jack he's he's a wrestler a professional
wrestler um
not a professional actor no he has one
expression in this whole movie which is
mildly concerned
and or confused that's what he does
through the whole movie
there is one scene though where he
fights the airplane's co-pilot who i'm
going to assume is also
some wrestler we don't know anything
about wrestling so you know when you say
oh the co-pilot
there's a cameo box oh yeah that's
so-and-so the grave digger
yeah yeah it's like how do you not know
that no we don't watch we don't know
wrestling and then they're doing some
sweet wrestling moves in the cockpit
and not to uh discount the fact that
they have this whole heist plan that
involves him taking over the cockpit
uh which requires him to knock out the
pilots
and i guess he was completely unaware
that planes have co-pilots
"Fucking co-pilot."
because he's completely caught off guard by that
he's an expert expert heist criminal jay
i think that was supposed to be like a
not a joke joke but like a
like funny thing yeah there's a lot of
that in this movie it's supposed to be
like
like i mentioned michael bay where it's
you know there's lots of humor in
michael bay movies
and it's always awkward and bad it's
trying to do that i think
it should be called they spent all their
money on kelsey grammer
or a lot of people owed
joey lawrence some favors i'm not sure
what
i'm gonna guess they mustered up a bunch
of cash
from the lawrence fund
all their their brotherly love uh
syndication
money this this couldn't have cost that
much to make so i'm sure the
they had once said yeah they had one
plain
tiny plane room that they reused for
multiple rooms and uh
so this this was obviously you know not
a
not a big budget film and uh they
thought that maybe they
they could carry the movie on names
uh mainly kelsey grammer his character's
name is
darius emmanuel grouch iii darius
emmanuel grouch
the third and if that's not enough he
also has a nickname of
the rumble better known as
the rumble which
if you're if your last name is grouch
that's your nickname you're the grouch
i don't know the rumble just sounds laughable
"Bunch of bitches."
yeah it kind of sounds like diarrhea
it's just i don't i don't get
i don't get the last name grouch either
i think of
sesame street yeah you think of oscar
the grouch you owe a lot of money to
some very bad people
i'm not just a businessman i'm an
opportunist
so i bought your debt uh maybe he's a
grouchy guy but no that's just his name
that that's it's like an austin powers
name like
like i can't wrap my head around if uh
if this movie was a joke or not
there is a legend in the underworld
those in the know it's called a money
plane
it doesn't feel like it that's the weird
thing visually it looks like it
the movie looks like a like a spoof
movie yeah that they meticulously edited
out all the jokes from
right because every time they cut to
that uh jack the main guy
cut to him in that cockpit it looks like
an snl sketch yeah yeah yeah
he's um and he's flying the plane and
he's doing the like the driving thing
and you're just like what yeah and
can we talk about like
we proceed with the plan we're in too
deep
we've got to get out of this mess
without getting double-crossed again
i just i don't know we'll start at the
beginning it's hard yeah there's a lot
i mean yeah this can be dissected and
let me just uh
preface by saying this is not funny bad
i'm just gonna get that for me it's not
laugh out loud funny but it's all
so poorly executed that cumulatively
it's funny but it's not it's not overly
like hilariously bad where you're
watching with a group of people and
everyone's
laughing and uh throwing things at the
screen all that so so rule that out
right off the bat rule that out um for
82 minutes
it felt like four hours i was like when
is this going to be over
but i was fascinated by so much of this
movie um
i can forgive low budget
uh if if you know someone who is like
20 years old made this in their mom's
backyard
you know with the plane set that they
built in their garage right
i could forgive it but considering the
fact
these are professionals these are
professionals and they're trying to pull
off
something um beyond their
range in in almost every facet
well it starts right at the beginning
where we have we have our little opening
action scene
to establish our our uh our group
that go that do these heists all the
time abort abort
we've been compromised abort
led by the wrestler guy led by jack but
we see this establishing shot of like
it looks like an abandoned insane asylum
but it's supposed to be an art museum
i think it's a trucking depot that you
could see all this oh yeah there's like
bays
but it's abandoned but clearly it's
clearly abandoned but they say it's an
art museum to the point where
they have text come up on the screen you
know like when you say like where
your movie's taking place but it just
says art museum
um but they're they're supposed to be
doing this heist to steal this painting
and it turns out that the painting
they're there to steal is not there
and that's the the setup for the whole
movie that when we get a revelation
later in the film makes literally no
sense
no i was so confused at first i was like
i i like the setup is yeah he's doing
this job he
the guy owes somebody money a lot he
owes a lot of bad people money
him and his crew uh the tech guy i
forget his name
his fake name is like mcgillicuddy or
something yeah he's a black guy i guess
it's supposed to be kind of funny
because he's an irishman yeah there's
not black people in ireland
again michael bay humor michael bay
level humor right uh
and then there's a girl who does like
something oh she's like the the loch
smith or the uh she's she's the safe
cracker
okay oh yeah or something um but she
never cracks any safes in the
entire film this is not the same vote
from the schematics it looks like biometric some upgraded version of that shit
i can still crack it but i'm gonna
need more time
there is no more time no no the safe is
controlled by a
uh i don't i don't even want to go there
there's a keypad on the safe but there's
also a thumbprint thing
yeah so she doesn't have to crack it no
there's no exciting safe cracking scene
that's
that's tense there's ticking clock gotta
crack the safe before the bad guys get
and find you like every aspect of of of
trying to do
like a you know a tom cruise-esque
mission impossible kind of thing with
the clever plot twists and the
and and the funny humor and that you
know the adventure and action it's
complete failure
the room where the painting is supposed
to be viewed this 40 million dollar
painting is
it's like drywall that's not like it's
on a concrete floor and there's like
brick walls yeah you see the two by
fours where they built the set and it's
like oh my god
and it's not in there and then he tries
to go in in the beginning he's like i
have a private viewing of the art
art and there's like nine cops there
with like machine guns and
he's he's scanning his card and the
guy's
trying to hack the thing hack the system
so the card is approved yeah yeah
uh so it turns out it was a switcheroo
kelsey grammer
faked the whole thing so that he could
trick jack into robbing the money plane
for him yeah just for cash well yeah the
the twist later in the movie you find
out that the painting that he was hired
to steal was actually own
he was hired by kelsey grammer but
kelsey grammer owned the painting
the name on record is some company
called bond
global now bond global is owned
by rumblecorp
why would he have you steal a painting
he already owns you didn't steal that
painting i wanted you to so now you've
got to rob the money plane for me
but there's no reason for him to do the
whole
fake stealing a painting thing because
he says you're going to rob the money
plane or i'm going to kill your family
it's the painting thing no purpose but
that scene so we have our opening failed
heist and then we see him sitting across
from kelsey grammer
and kelsey grammer introduces himself to
him
even though they have a history together
darius emmanuel grouch
the third then that's the setup
to get to the money plane well yeah as
kelsey grammer's expl well first of all
he's like i could kill you right now
and he has a henchman with a canvas that
he puts behind his head
well it's it's like does he just always
have that on hand for what he has to
threaten somebody it's a good threat he
has his little henchmen with a canvas
behind him
i'm gonna blow your brains out on this
canvas and create my own jackson pollock
yeah yeah
yeah i was like okay that's a that's
cute but when kelsey grammer's
explaining the money plane to him he's
like it's all sorts of
illegal gambling and illegal illegal
activity going on that plane but
no one can be prosecuted because it's
happening over international waters
uh and he says something about like if
you wanna any anything you want can be
wagered on the money plane if you wanna see a dude fuck an alligator
money plane the money plane has you
covered you wanna bet on a dude fuck an alligator
money plane
which is the line of the
movie but i'm just wondering what that
bet is
uh yeah i wrote copious notes i wrote
like this whole page in the first seven
minutes
oh god i don't even know where to start
money plane
stock music the dresser is next to the
bed
like where where the nightstand goes and
he has a loaded gun
in his dresser and he has a like a
five-year-old daughter
oh yeah dude fucking an alligator
plan a is only as good as your plan b
three plan a is only as good as your
plan b
sounds like like something confucius
would say
no cameras on board no cameras on board
i wrote that down because we're going to
talk about
all the crazy illegal activities so you
can't have the cameras on the money
plane there there are there are
many little lines that are thrown in
there they're all delivered by joy
lawrence who plays the concierge of of
the plane
or as he describes himself the concierge
i am your concierge and i am here to
facilitate your every desire
for action and speculation yes he does
say that i thought i heard that
ira wound it to make sure one take
that's all they get
the concierge he also makes a point
that's in
that's in the scene where they're like
welcome to the money plane gentlemen
there's like
six people on the money plane when you
think of this like giant elaborate
decadent
uh plane with all this gambling and
stuff you picture like a double decker
and just people everywhere
it is a double-decker um and i don't
know i'm assuming that's stock footage
of
a plane it's like a blank white plane
and it's a double decker and all the
windows on the bottom are blocked out
um like or closed or whatever um but
then when we see the interior it's one
tiny little
half of an airplane side but joey
lawrence is introducing
he's like yeah we have the we have a
great staff on the plane we have the
the best pilots because they're like ooh
that was a smooth takeoff
now that is a smooth takeoff
obliged we employ the finest pilots in
the world
we have the best we hire nothing but the
best pilots and i should know because
i am a pilot i know because i myself
am a pilot and they really emphasize
that i thought he was going to
fly the plane i thought there was going
to be a situation where he had to take
over flying the plane
never brought up again that never
happened why is that line in there
and i don't know who oh i know why
because i'll explain it to you right now
jay okay
um they set up right off the bat that
jack goes into his daughter's bedroom
then the evening before they're they're
going to go on the money plane heist
and he reads her robin hood yeah and the
and she goes daddy it's okay to steal
for your family
he's like yes
and she's like can i steal candy from my friend that's a bitch
and he's like no if you give the candy
to other kids yeah
so there's some hackneyed like this is a
good guy plot because they end up
killing people
on the money plane of course and and the
the end of the film
they bail out of the money plane with
both
pilots dead so it's built in
because we don't know who's flying the
plane after they bail out
yeah so it's built in that these three
heroes
uh didn't just abandon the plane with
absolutely no one on board who's capable
of landing it
i was wondering that for the second half
of the movie when they're all in the
back of the plane taking care of the
money in the cryptocurrency i was like
who's the fuck's flying the plane
autopilot okay autopilot it's the
autopilot from airplane
yeah the blow-up doll yes yes
i don't think autopilot can land a plane
um i don't think it's that sophisticated
technology yet so are we supposed to
assume that joey lawrence landed the
plane
okay why not just show that then money
plane
well i don't know it's a thinker
what can i say it's a thing that's why
they said that so we know that they
didn't just let the plane like
slowly you know lose power and crash
into a
major city and blow up and kill god
forbid you kill all these human
traffickers
well not yet that's the thing is some of
them might be
like just people who want to gamble and
they might not all be awful
yeah yeah you don't want your characters
killing everyone on the money plane
even though they are mostly awful people
right money plane
uh yeah i i can't even fathom
the concept like i said it's like an
eight-year-old wrote it
the plane flies over international
waters
so they can do illegal gambling yeah
with cryptocurrency
and or cash they they say that that's
one of the setup lines we have the best
pilots in the world
and to my knowledge not even the best
pilots in the world can avoid
turbulence and every airplane
goes through some kind of turbulence at
some point which is why there has never
been
a casino on an airplane
because you would at any moment
an airplane could hit turbulence and
fling everybody's shit all over the place
which is why when you're on an airplane
they say stay in your seat or have your
seatbelt on
when you're not going around because at
any moment the plane could just
hit turbulence and you could fly up and
bang your head which happens a lot
there are casinos on cruise ships and
and that isn't moving and
an actual cruise ship has very little
movement um because they're so big and
you know they're not unless you hit like
a rogue wave
like the poseidon adventure um your
cruise ship isn't going to constantly
you know rock back and forth unless it's
in a storm right but
airplanes you can't put a casino on an
airplane
but also it's like okay so where where
does this casino plane
land and take off in an undisclosed
location they show the the mat the wide
shot of stock footage of an airport yeah
it says undisclosed location yes
it says it says uh money plane terminal
undisclosed location and there's like
50 planes and it's clearly like a big
it's a working airport
it's a major airport it's just stock
footage of a major airport so then they
and then when they show the terminal
where they're boarding the plane it's
just a bunch of curtains
a bunch of curtains are all those money
plans
or is one money plane get its own
private little terminal somehow
it should be in some like completely
rogue nation
on on the planet earth right like north
korea or something where they have like
an agreement with the north korean
government can we use this one
barely used terminal at your airport
we're going to pay
kim jong-un a hundred million dollars a
year to let us use this airport and he's
not gonna
he's gonna look the other way so we've
gotta fly to north korea first
and and go to the money plane terminal
that's secretly hidden behind this wall
that opens up
behind north korean guards and you have
to you know that but they don't
they don't even set that up so it's like
what airport who where
what
money plan because because if it's if
it's in the united states which i'm
assuming it is it seems to be pretty
close to where they all live i guess
yeah we have the the faa and all sorts
of
laws and regulations about money planes
inspection safety inspections who's
operating this airliner
uh has has you know who what ground crew
works on it who who fixes the engine
mike they hire the best they are the
best the best crew um so it's a it's a
laughable
concept to be asked to take seriously
yes money plan well and then when you
see the execution of
the money plane they're introducing all
the different rooms of the plane and
he's like this is the main gaming room
and there's like
one table in it and some curtains that's
how they they separate the rooms it's
the same little set but they go through
curtains and now they're in a new set
they just redecorate it the one little
plane set they had and apparently they
have like
like hotel rooms too because he's like
i'm gonna go to my cabin
yeah and then we never see we never see
that so at some
some place on the plane um i've i have
not been
on like a gigantic double-decker
huge jet but the size
like window to window was like a
like a cheap domestic airliner you know
what i mean
oh yeah and not like a much wider um
uh like international plane where
there's like four or five seats in the
middle and then
three it could be much bigger but i i
i wanna say this i think they filmed on
a real plane
like a decommissioned plane and i'll
explain why maybe
like a part of one that was in a
warehouse somewhere that's what i mean
um because because i would have made the
sets much
bigger which which explains kind of
we always have a theory with bad b
movies
they had access to oh sure ellipses you
know
we have this decommissioned just
commercial plane
we have this tiny little section of it
we got to film everything in there yeah
we got we have a chunk
of plain that we can use and uh because
the doors look like legit
like they didn't build they could only
afford curtains
yes so they did not build an actual like
working
door it's probably you know they have
all these like different uh
studio spaces in la they probably just
had like
the airplane set that you can rent and
they rented that out
maybe um but but one of the reasons why
i think it may have been a real plane
was because
uh they when when the wrestler is flying
the plane
um you see him holding the controls
right and you can see some of the
details
and it looks like all crappy
a worn out oh like an older and they
they don't film the
way forward um which i'm guessing
is because maybe they ripped out a lot
of the control guts
recycled some of the parts like they
didn't have all the shit in the cockpit
that made it a perfectly working cockpit
yeah yeah all the
the shots in there are really like
they're lost yeah
and um they don't uh they obviously put
a green screen up
along the side window and part of the
front window but you never see that
that shot where they're looking forward
yeah
and you see the real controls so it
looks like real plane stuff
because if you're gonna build a plane
set it'll look
either really bad in this case in in
their budgetary sense it'll look
terrible
or or a little look like the ed wood uh
right where's the plane set mr wood it's
right handy did it yeah
it would look like that or it would um
or they would try to make it look
not crappy and aged it looked aged this
is what we have
access to look like an airliner from
like the 1970s or something where it was
like
like decaying and rotting but the money
planes have been around for a while it's
the most luxurious and elegant
sophisticated airliner in the world and
for the most elite
rich people to gamble and you know
that's what i heard from the concierge
i am your concierge and clearly the
below deck stuff is a
set just like a junkie set with
it's like a hallway set it's so tiny
well they go into the the
like the storage room or something the
safe room
and you can see like the two by fours
and the other side of the two by fours
they put some like like like metal
sheeting
on a like a closet door to make it look
like it was like a secured room
but there was no there was just a
doorknob yeah there wasn't there's one
room they go it's like supposed to be
the server room
because that's where all the the crypto
money is being stored because that's
how the internet works i don't even know
what's happening
who stole the cookie from the cookie jar
who me yeah you stole that cookie
i just know that the only character
that's really like proactive in the
movie is the girl of the group
her name is isabelle she has the exact
same scene
three times throughout the movie which
is she tries to sneak into a room
there's so little security on this plane
because they're just sneaking around
everywhere through the whole thing
she sneaks into a room a dude shows up
and she has to
half-assedly seduce him and then beat
him up
that exact same scene happens three
times literally happens three times
yeah it's embarrassing it's like i don't
know what else do you do with a girl
my favorite it's the third time where
the guy comes at her and she breaks a
bottle
and starts like stabbing him in the
stomach with it yeah but then in the
very next shot all the blood that was
rushing out of his stomach is just gone
he's completely clean again
yeah the sound effects are really
awkward too it's like too quiet yeah so
that's a really awkward sound
punching sounds aren't your traditional
yeah
and they're mixed really quietly yeah um
yeah they bought some breakaway glass
clearly they they show the bottles
they're made of like
sugar or something right yeah a sugar
glass and then and then yeah they really
made use of those
she smashes like a like a whiskey bottle
on his head
uh and it just like it shatters like
it's made of like sugar glass
like a whiskey bottle would be really
difficult to break over someone's head
that's like a rugged
even those are those are thick yeah it's
hard to hard to break those yeah
yeah and then oh she throws the guy into
the servers
oh yeah i wanted to mention this part um
and
ah he gets electrocuted he doesn't even
touch anything
no and the servers are like old vcrs
because one i saw a dvd tray was open it
opened in the shot
like accidentally there was like a burn
dvd in there they went to like
like the goodwill and bought a bunch of
like
old vcrs and dvd players and piled them
up so that they could be their servers
i guess servers are like electrically
charged
well that's why that's the reason
they're behind that glass oh
they have a live electrical charge going
exactly yeah you can't touch them
you can't even like do maintenance on
them or press them no don't touch them
no they're just they're
they're it's live and electrically
charged
high voltage those uh computer servers
so if you fly through that glass
you get electrocuted by uh
just going like this and there nothing
happens to you
uh it's like a pull like a play there's
like make believe
we're playing make believe here comes
daddy
i guess he flies the plane now he should
have been the one like involved in all
the
like the gambling uh hijinks trey will
represent me
while isabella searches for the vault
and the server room like mcgillicuddy
was you know it was that was for comical
effect like
the the in addition to traditional
gambling like
they play texas hold'em uh which is
oh my god they have like a like a like a
plastic poker table
the dealer is all sloppy
and then they have like those poker
chips that you buy from like
like target or walmart like that
are red black green and white that have
no denominations on them
and no no like logos or anything they're
just like plastic
like party poker chips yeah and this is
supposed to be like a legit
serious gambling establishment these are
chip lab casino grade poker chips and
ordering custom chips like these
is fast and easy play poker chips are
most popular choice and are available in
12 colors
and several styles the white part of the
chip
is the customizable area both sides can
be the same or they can be different
we mass produce these chips so same day
shipping is available and the normal
turnaround time is just a few days
but then the is it the winner of texas
hold'em decides the next game or
something like that where that's when
they we get to the russian roulette
scene
yes and that's matthew lawrence in a
comical fake mustache and cowboy hat
and that's a moment that i guess is
supposed to be intentionally funny
yeah they're like you go first no you go
first and it goes on for a while
and then the payoff is that joey learns
matthew lawrence just shoots himself in
the head
i can't lose
yeah he's is he the one that wanted to
play russian roulette yeah because he
always wins he always wins
why would you ever want to play that i
mean because this is the money plane bitch
anything goes
oh my god
money plane
because then we get to the the other
gambling which is like they have like a
live feed of somebody in like a snake
pit
yes like betting on how long we never
see the snake
no no they couldn't afford the snake
they spent all their money on the poker
chips
and there's a there's a like a pentagram
i don't know what that's about
i think it's because they they said okay
well who
who what kind of shady people around the
world would agree to
do this kind of stuff okay maybe devil
worshipers
maybe weird like russian mobsters
because there's a scene where two
russian guys hack
an arm off yeah and i don't even know
what they're betting on like how long it
takes to
hack off an arm i don't know
i was wondering about that with the
piranhas they throw a guy in a head of
piranha it was how long can the piranhas
eat down to the bone whoa stripped to
the bone
in one minute and 56 seconds won again
by
mr mcgillicuddy and that's only like a
minute
yeah and i was like how do you i can
tell and it's like this fake skeleton
comes up
and it's some like like i don't know
chinese guy or something so it's like
okay so there's sketchy parts of the
world
where there's criminal underworld that
will do this
i'm assuming they get paid by the
concierge
uh and and the the money plane
enterprise
in which case the whole flying over
international airspace doesn't even
matter because all the criminal activity
is taking place on the ground
yes money plan
this job sucks
uh if we're going to talk about kelsey
grammer this is i don't i wouldn't say
phoned it in it's just like he put in
the appropriate amount of effort for
money plane
are you really fucking with me right now
are you fucking with me
yeah
you don't quite buy him when he's saying
he has a line towards the end of the
movie where he says i'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet
i'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet
i'm darius grouch the third
i am darius crouch the third the rumble and i am taking down the money plane
now bring me my money
how do you deliver those lines menacingly and serious
you don't
so kelsey grammer is just like whatever
it's a paycheck well we get to the ends
and they decide
to when when uh jack realizes that he's
been double-crossed by
uh the rumble um
and then he got set up to rob the bunny
plane even though he didn't need the
original set up the painting anyway um
but he does like a secret recording of
of
kelsey grammer we get a flashback to
their original meeting where i guess he
has a microphone or something under the
table
why did he put that there just in
anticipation that he would need it later
can you trust a guy named the rumble
that's true
darius grouch the third i wouldn't trust
darius grouch the third
that wouldn't i wouldn't trust darius
grouch the second
he's a shady businessman but i like that
yeah it's not just a
like a recorder that he has to come back
and get later they got the prop right
but they're talking over
his computer anyway they have like a a
camera lens i know
can you just record the sound from the
computer that's where
i don't give a fuck who's on that plane
i'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet
oh but but it's this big like bulky
object with like
like an antenna on it that's that's
clearly like okay well
you know he can't just put a digital
recorder down there because he'd have to
come back and get it
yeah it has to be something that could
transmit to a plane that's god knows
where
so it has to be bulky and have a big
antenna
um and kelsey grammer never noticed it
and
and i guess when kelsey grammer gets mad
he reaches under his table and
shakes it yeah
we could tell he wanted to flip that
table and wherever they were shooting
that he probably couldn't so he just
kind of went
i thought he was going to flip the table
but but he records kelsey grammer saying
i'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet
i'm darius grouch the third and i want
i'm gonna take down the money plane
he says all those very specific things
so they know exactly who he is
i don't give a fuck who's on that plane
i'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet
i am darius the third the rumble and i am taking down the money plane 
nwo bring me my money
so then when jack plays that recording back i guess through the sound system of the money plane
it's set up remember they play music
through it oh yeah that's true
so then everybody just airtight script
it is it is so then everybody all the
criminals on the money plane i guess
they're just like well
okay we'll go kill this i guess we got
to kill that guy that i just heard over
the radio
we don't even know who he is or where he
is or what he is well they find him
pretty quick
on behalf of the house i want to assure
you that mr grouch's head will be on a
platter by the time we land
they find them in five seconds yeah but
they can't even
secure their own aircraft they don't
even know it's been taken over
no and i at least give the movie credit
for this the logic
uh lapses are explained in
bafflingly pointless throwaway lines
like joey lawrence's
his job there is to set up
all the things that don't make sense
later with his concierge character
he says there are no cameras on board
because we respect your privacy
as you know there are no cameras on
board this is to ensure the utmost
discretion
but that doesn't explain why there
wouldn't be cameras
outside of their their vault and
their server room and their cockpit
and the places where patrons
or guests of the money plane don't go
or aren't supposed to be because there's
clearly a line that says you're not
supposed to be down here
i think the girl says it she's wearing
the
flight attendant costume someone said
she says it to the guy who's he's
smoking he's like oh yeah you're not
supposed to be down here
yeah you're not supposed to be down here
so why wouldn't you have cameras down
there
because money plane logically the money
plane would have like a security room
with three or four guys watching
monitors that monitor
a room full of cash right
and not just have one not two
one security guard watching a room full
of
cash and servers containing
billions not millions they say billions
over a billion billions of dollars of
cryptocurrency which
can be hacked and transmitted easily
with an iphone
well they originally needed help from
their man on the ground the other
lawrence
but then thugs show up to kill him so
that thomas jane has to get involved
with a drone with a gun awkwardly
attached to
it it's not even like a super cool drone
that's like made specifically with with
machine guns
guns built into it it's just a toy drone
that they just attached the toy gun to
because you know what the script called
for
was a like a predator drone like he had
military
background so he might have had access
to a predator drone
which is like those things are big
sure they're like like i don't know
they're as big as like a couple of cars
they're huge they're not like you know
now there's a little toy one of those
little white plastic drones with a gun
on it
they wanted a predator drone they didn't
have
access to the proper stock footage of a
predator drone
uh and they didn't want to do a cgi
predator drone it would have looked
terrible oh they should have done that
so they got one at best buy and they
they duct taped a gun to it
and that was the best they could do um
right up your ass
to be you pal i'm i'm still on the fence
on whether or not this movie was an
actual
joke i really don't know i really don't
know
it's it's so poorly made it's all played
so straight though
i didn't get the impression that it's
like an intentionally bad movie i think
it's just
a very very cheap movie that in their
mind they had something more
elaborate and it just kept getting
whittled down and whittled down
yeah that's possible because yeah you
could kind of see
like the faint shadow
of of what it was supposed to be or what
they're trying to do
it's hard to it's hard it's something
that's really hard to nail down
another interestingly bad movie that
though it's interesting this has been a
good year for that
between like veronica who is it
i'm in here i didn't call maintenance
today
and then aqua splash and now this this
has been a great year for
for confusingly terrible movies
veronica's yeah that's
that's confusingly terrible that's
it's got to be like a new category
veronica wasn't hilariously bad either
but
no none of these were but they're all
interesting to watch
and like try and figure out what were
they thinking i'd love to be a fly on
the wall
while this movie was being made and just
kind of watch
watch it all come together or even in
the editing room or
oh my god the muzzle flares from 1992.
like from your digital action pack
or you drop the the effect you could
find
better more realistic looking muzzle flares on like fucking youtube for free
yeah
and they look like they're they're painted on
like in like photoshop like they look
really bad they look like suburban
sasquatch like muzzle flares like
like an amateur movie from like the 90s
yeah like that scene when kelsey grammer
like shoots the machine gun
was that when they they cut away because
they didn't have any actors to actually
shoot yes
yes yeah the the the the elite assassin
squad from the money plane come to
i guess they showed up they're off
camera but they're there trust us yeah
he knows they're there so he gets a big
machine gun and he
he does like it's like a an attempt at
like a scarface ending and yeah and it's
just like the
digital camera shake and kelsey
grammer's screaming
and the muzzle flares look terrible and
oh my god
so that's why i question the the
legitimacy of this movie
uh whether or not it's supposed to be
funny bad
or if they just had like the worst
cheapest editor
who's just like i'm not putting in any
effort into this
you're not paying me enough yeah i'm
just going to do the worst job on this because you're you're an asshole you're not
paying me enough
i'll put in muzzle flares but i'm not
going to put in good ones because i hate
you
like that's that's that's the vibe i got
from the editing
all right you sons of bitches let's do it
would you recommend it would you
recommend someone watching this i i
guess i should ask you first because
you're the one who said we should do
this movie
yeah um i would yeah
i thought it was like i said it's it's
not like hilariously bad like a like a
best of the worst movie but
there it does have this like cumulative
effect on you
where as it went on it was more and more
amusing to me
it's like looking at a train wreck i'm
sure we've said that many times but
it yeah it's just so cheap and there's
so many weird little decisions that you
have one
on top of the other uh it's certainly
interesting
from a movie-making perspective it's
just baffling and
terrible at how bad something could be
yeah money plan and and not in a
in a charming way got a bad feeling
about this things are going south
in in kind of a disgusting way i felt
like like i wanted to throw up after
watching it
like in in a way where i felt sorry for
everyone involved in it
all the actors i felt like sick money
plan
like an embarrassed
bunch of bitches
you know what i mean
as as myself as a viewer like sick
after after like maybe an hour of it i
felt sick
okay okay that something could exist
made by human beings that that is so bad
i felt literally nauseous so you'd
recommend it yeah
fuck it
you know it's been weeks since we've had
a vcr repair job
yeah you'd think there'd be an uptick
since all the streaming services are
offline
if it wasn't for those newfangled dvd
players
tons of people would be needing our
services my
dvds aren't uh never mind hey what do we
do now
well since we can't watch tv movies or
riots
maybe we should look into bettering
ourselves you know
i'm gonna start working out more i'm
gonna get into shape
maybe i'll take up meditation or yoga
get in touch with my spiritual side yeah
you know before we became vcr repairman
i was writing a novel
what really yeah it's been my dream
since i was little to be an author
you know write the great american novel
i've been thinking about revisiting that
you know reflecting on my dreams
aspirations
and honing that into a novel that will
inspire
and hopefully netflix is back oh thank
god
nice oh yeah yeah yeah nice
can you take a minute whoa
are those chicks are those chickens
okay
rose rose yes i'm here oh i dropped the
show
thank you
okay i'm done i'm done i'm done i'm done
you're done
oh my god
money plane
