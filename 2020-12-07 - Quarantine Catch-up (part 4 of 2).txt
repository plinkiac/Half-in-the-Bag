well mike it sure has been a great year
for movies
what happened oh nothing i would i
didn't even hear what you said
i just like it went down the wrong pipe
oh as they say you know was it a cough
or a sneeze it's just
just like was it a dry cough do you have
a fever i i don't have any any symptoms
of of covet oh
but yeah i was just just a coffee just
they really like appeared to be what
they call a spit take
yeah like a reaction i say something
outrageous
right right yeah it's a staple of comedy
right and um
it in no way was a spit take because i i
did not hear what you said you said
what oh i was saying it's uh
sarcastically i was saying it's been a
great year for movies
oh sorry it happened again it just
i don't know something's wait hold on
it's weird
so it's just a coincidence that it keeps
happening whenever i sarcastically say
that it's been a great year for movies
you thought it was gonna happen again oh
my god
half in the bag i put pizza rolls in my
vcr so i could watch them on tv but it
didn't work
in case you're wondering i'm not
drinking out of the java hot coffee mug
that has a chip in it no this is a brand
new one that you can
break a chip off of right the old one is
right here with the chip
and as you can see all the leftover
coffee in it has
horribly molded as coffee always does
i just wanted to make sure no one drank
out of it what have you been watching
oh my god i've been watching movies uh
you've been watching movies you've also
been watching some tv shows more tv than
movies yeah
which makes sense it fills more time
during the empty void that is our
existence
tv a lot of tvs long movies some of
these like these limited series things
uh
there's eight episodes it's a long movie
some of them are too long
some of them should be a movie some of
them feel just right
some of them feel like they could go on
even further
but that's what we're here to talk about
today what is going on in the world
of entertainment what is out there
there's basically nothing
except for a movie batman with mel
gibson
and a movie where russell crowe is is a
is a road rager oh unhinged i watched
unhinged
russell crowe should never start a film
called unhinged
as we all remember he he beat a hotel
employee unconscious with a phone
is that true yeah i never heard about
that
how did i miss this exciting news
russell crowe flipped out and he
smashed a phone on a hotel employee and
he went crazy
and then he was banned from the us for
like a decade what
everybody knows about russell crowe in
the hotel phone i honestly did not know
that
i know speaking of fat man i know a lot
about bel gibson but that's a whole
other story
yeah mel gibson i hear he once put his
hand up the ass of a beaver
well jody foster watched
um do you remember the last film we we
saw in the theaters
i'm trying to try it was rise of
skywalker
like a year ago yeah december december
that's the last movie i saw in the movie
theater but the coronavirus like
january february there wasn't [ __ ] out
we didn't go see a movie
that's right okay okay weird
oh my gosh rise of skywalker was the
last film i've ever seen in a movie
theater in my whole life that you will
ever see in a movie theater right
but i think now people after the last
year are getting more accustomed to
watching stuff at home
where it's like you don't need to go to
a theater yeah that model will change
it's it's yeah it's going to change
drastically even when theaters do reopen
yeah so i mean something like wonder
woman like sure i can see the appeal of
seeing that in a big theater
um something like unhinged which i
watched was perfect to watch at home
where people could not hear me laughing
at the film and russell crowe
who looks like he's made of silly putty
these days
can you go please
but unhinged was entertaining it was bad
and i know this was like when they first
after the first wave and they reopened
theaters this unhinged was like one of
the movies they put out
and it flopped horribly and i can see
why it's not
it's not a particularly good movie but
it's pretty entertaining like the old
days of like a like a b
movie like a classic b movie where it's
got a high concept but it's really
stupid
but that's what kind of makes it
entertaining well the trailer didn't
make it look
stupid i mean it just it i
actually like the trailer a lot they
don't think i've seen the trailer
there's this like remix of um uh
heart-shaped box
yeah there's russell crowe lady honks at
him or something and
it's it's road rage the movie road rage
yeah i i say it's stupid because it it
requires all the characters to make
stupid decisions at every possible turn
in order for the movie to happen
because otherwise this whole incident
would be over in 10 minutes
he's not chasing her the whole movie he
has like her phone and he's tracking her
and stuff but
he goes at one point he goes to a diner
and sits down with
her lawyer and just kills him
in this diner and then just walks out
the cops don't show up so it's stuff
like that and like the kid towards the
end of the movie he's hiding in a
there's like a hiding like a hiding spot
in this house where it's like you open
the closet and there's a little
trap door thing and he hides in there if
you just stayed in there
nothing would happen
and if the woman didn't park her car in
front of the house that they were hiding
in
he wouldn't know they were there like
simple things like that
that's the whole movie but russell crowe
is like hamming it up
and it's funny because the the kid it's
a mom and her son
and the son in it is the same kid from
the child's play remake
and his mom in this is also super young
and i remember in that child's play it
was him in aubrey plaza
so that's like it's always like him and
his super young mom
and i was like they should have just had
aubrey plaza and just haven't been the
same characters
well uh i guess
i want to talk about i got apple plus
tv apple tv plus oh yeah um
and uh i saw a movie was coming out this
was a pandemic
casualty and i was like oh cool i'd
watch that
even in the movie theaters you know uh
it would be fun to see that number then
the coronavirus happened
and um it it uh it got it disappeared
for a while and then it ended up on
apple plus
or apple what is it called apple tv plus
apple tv not to be confused with apple
tv which is their physical
device their streaming device okay
whatever
it's a giant mess um and uh oh so it's
greyhound with with tom hanks
okay i thought you're gonna say that on
the rocks movie the sofia coppola movie
i know you saw that too but it's like
why would that be
something you'd care to see in the
theater
uh no i was like oh cool tom hanks world
war ii
uh and then and then went away and then
i was like well whatever
and then it's it's just straight to
apple plus and then nobody saw i don't
know
plus nobody subscribed to apple tv plus
but i i enjoyed it uh it's
it's basically a world war ii porn with
tom hanks um it's uh
gosh it's not about a bus
uh it's based on an old book from like
the 1950s and which is
it's very like tom hanks wrote the
script right oh i didn't know that
and and it is it is like shockingly bare
bones
okay and there's like one scene in the
beginning where he meets up with uh
elizabeth shu and and then she's like
well you marry me elizabeth shoe
she's like not now that we just got into
world war ii
it was like two months in into the war
the u.s
part part of the war and um he's like
okay i gotta go do a thing
i'm a navy captain uh so basically he's
a navy captain
um and and he was him and two other
ships his ship
it wasn't called the greyhound those are
code name there's two other ships and
they're protecting the convoy a big
fleet
going across the atlantic uh from german
u-boats
and that was our job is to just kind of
like fight the u-boats off
so they don't sink as many ships yeah
but lots of them get sunk
um but that's that's it as far as the
plot it's like it's like okay
one scene in the beginning and then
later on he thinks about her he's like
she gave me a pair of slippers i'm gonna
put my slippers on
and then the whole movie is just
technical
combat target bearing zero nine two
range
was too i mean that's just sort of
matter of fact and simple and stripped
down
yes but um there's a lot more going on
in dunkirk there's a lot more
story lines there's characters yeah it
is very it's cutting back between a few
days it doesn't
um it doesn't ham in the
the schmaltzy hollywood like plot lines
and this and that like
it sounds like greyhound barely has that
it just barely does you got to put
something in
right it's it's that tom hanks wrote the
whole script himself
okay so he doesn't i don't think he
understands like the the robert
zemeckis-esque
like your audience he just wanted to do
this like really
really specific and it's not even like a
true story per se
like like this captain was a real person
so that's the same private ryan esque
where it's
like fictionalized yeah but it's like
real thing like a real
scenario that happened where boats had
to protect you know
fleets from u-boats um and so it's just
like him like
go down so it's 22.2 degrees this way
and blah blah and
they're calling down to the room and the
guy's doing the thing with the like the
calculations of which way the ship
should turn
they're launching the depth charges into
the water and
i mean if you love world war ii stuff it
looks great
it sounds great it's got explosions
but but really that's like a big mess
for anyone who doesn't love world war ii
porn
yeah it's interesting to see these these
uh theater casualties the movies that
were supposed to come out in theaters
and where they end up
who's willing to pay for them right
because i know uh
someone was trying to buy the james bond
movie
it might have been apple it might have
been apple tv plus and they're like we
need like
like 700 million dollars you want to
buy it from us for that like never mind
yeah because they know they know you got
to make that box office money and
they're all they're doing is delaying
the inevitable
all these movies are going to flop the
good thing to come out of this is
hopefully the the return of mid-budget
movies
because movies are too [ __ ] expensive
when you set up these movies where they
have to make a billion dollars in order
to to make a profit like
it's out of hand avengers end game feels
like the end of an era
that's the last blockbuster and that's
funny yeah
yeah it does feel like it's kind of that
at least a pause yeah on that era but
um yeah i have hbo max is that what it
is and there's lots of good content on
it hbo
like shows are the best in my opinion
i've watched shows on
apple plus uh oh god the worst i think
is show time
but hbo has a lot of good stuff and they
have like all the dc
rights yeah um because i've watched doom
patrol just real quick throw out their
doom patrol seasons one and two
excellent program
oh i i'd hope to discuss it someday with
with our friend rich evans he hasn't
found the time to watch it
what's he busy doing i have no idea but
i'm sure a number cruncher said oh my
gosh
wonder woman comes out right i bet you
they cancel their their
month free trial at that point um you
know what i mean
well that's yeah i feel like this this
will be helpful to hbo max but probably
not helpful to
the wonder woman movie as far as making
its money back well money's money
it doesn't matter where it comes from if
they make if they projected wonder woman
to pull in
700 million from theaters and
they project that uh x amount of people
will sign
up for that first month and pay what
twenty dollars or whatever it is yeah to
what just to get access to
see wonder woman right away and then
they say well how many people out of
those you think will cancel or how many
people just forget about it and keep it
on
um and then somebody just got a
microsoft excel spreadsheet
and figured it out and said hey we could
we can make about the same
maybe more if we release it now well
that's the advantage of that is you
don't have to give
the theaters half of your box office
that factored into their mathematical
sure it did i mean universal has been
the studio that's been trying to get
away from theaters they tried like a
decade ago
with the movie tower heist if you
remember that with uh
ben stiller and uh eddie murphy that was
going to be universal's first attempt to
release something in theaters and vod at
the same time and the theaters were like
no
yeah i remember that and at that point
the theaters held the cards they were
still a major
source of revenue so you had to kind of
bow to them and now they're starting to
get to a point where they don't need
theaters anymore it's good when theaters
reopen theaters are going to need the
studios more than the studios need
theaters
yeah is what i predict is going to
happen it'll flip there's there's that
but then you you risk not making nearly
as much as you would if it was in the
theaters
right right it's all up in the air it's
all kind of exciting with what a mess it
is
it's all interesting it's interesting
it's interesting and then you have apple
tv plus which kind of reminds me of an
outdated model of
it's kind of like what happened with
quibby too or it's like we'll just throw
a ton of money at all these big names
and all this big talent and and that'll
drive people to our service because it's
got all these famous people on it
but nobody's watching apple tv plus how
do you know
that jake how do you know that do you
know anybody that has talked about any
of the shows on apple tv plus or any of
the movies well that's the thing is like
when you say talked about
unless we had hard data and i i think
i think the government should force
streaming services
to share their data that is the
difference between streaming and
theaters
you don't get those numbers right or
something like that i'm just saying i
look at all the lineup on apple tv plus
regardless of what anybody else is
saying i look at it and i just see
uh people burning money and all these
big name celebrities and all this big
and all of it looks so bland
all the other like original shows i
watched one episode of amazing stories
because i remember that from when i was
a fetus the original amazing stories
and it was fine it was a fine episode
but it's just so bland
it's like apple in general everything's
so like slick
and minimal and clean looking it doesn't
have that grit or that heart to it
servant was good it was weird
up until a certain point and then it
became like annoying and then it
didn't end
it's gonna keep people coming back for
more seasons it kind of ended
is it about like a like a fake dead baby
yes
there's a really good it feels like a
very limited thing for a series
it feels like a movie idea it was
definitely a thing where it could have
been told in a two-hour movie
because it was stretched and that
that kid from uh harry potter was in his
[ __ ] terrible
oh yeah you're telling me about it he's
trying to do an american accent right
i was a terrible terrible actor why do
you have to call him the kid
from harry potter i know you gotta call
him the kid from thunder pants
uh well you mentioned jordan peel
earlier speaking of
uh wishing they were jordan peele i saw
antebellum
oh this was another theater casualty did
he slap his name on that
he has nothing to do with it but they
want you to think he does didn't say
from the producer it says like from the
producers
something like that he had nothing to do
with it and it shows
these sapphires are here to fulfill your
ever need
it's not very good speed of germ appeal
and speaking of m night shyamalan
it feels like mid-career i'm not
shyamalan which isn't a compliment
so what is it a a black lady from modern
times gets sent back to the
antebellum south there's no time travel
uh it's it it does kind of an
interesting it starts out in
yeah this is slave era his character is
a slave
and then about halfway through the movie
there's like a narrative shift
and we're in modern times and for five
seconds you're like oh what is what's
going on here this is interesting
and then your brain catches up and
you're thinking about what the twist is
gonna be
whereas like are you open sorry
what what happened i
must have too much coffee oh so just
something weird imagery flashing in my
eyes oh
uh oh okay so uh
a cheap knockoff of the jordan peel
project
knock off of jordan peel uh wannabe m
night shyamalan
quality and hitting you over the head
level of the twilight zone the new
twilight zone
so all the the worst of the worst in
this movie and nothing nothing to
elevate it above that that's the thing
is let you look at like the german peel
movies
he clearly likes horror and he's
creative and comes up with these weird
ideas
this movie is so basic and so
it ends up almost being uh insulting
because there's been so many movies made
about slavery
there's been really good ones and
there's been ones that are like if you
want to show the horrors of slavery
you have to show the horrors of slavery
and this movie felt like it was
like walking on eggshells to be about
what it was about
it felt so sanitized which is like i
mean i get it you don't want to turn
into like torture porn
but you have to if you want to make a
point you have to show things as they
were
and this one is so timid to do that and
then on top of that it has this dumb
twist to it
well what's the connection to modern day
like is that
in in in her own way in modern day
society she's still a slave kind of like
because of racism or like do you want to
know the twist do you care
sure so if the audience doesn't mind
spoilers everybody for antebellum
the whole movie has been modern times
and they've taken her to this compound
where they reenact slavery reenacts
being
slave owners because racism
against her will yes but it's all like
antiquated everyone's wearing little
tiny costumes yeah it's just like the
village just like the
the shameless it's like a secret society
that has slaveries
slavery they kidnap people and they then
they treat them like slaves when you
said it's like the village it made sense
what the what was happening yeah
exactly like the village okay i thought
maybe it was like a civil war reenactors
like reenacting slavery
no no no it's like yeah it's like a
secret secret group that does this
modern day like southern racists that is
a classic example of it sounded good on
paper
yeah um but if not handled correctly no
the only saving graces that lead uh
janelle monae
is her name the singer she's a musician
she's a singer she's
very good with what she's given but
that's about
that's about all i got out of antebellum
if antebellum was a swing and a miss
uh uncle frank was a
i don't know maybe a foul ball i guess
that's
equivalent to swinging a mess basically
a bunt
no bun bunt has its purpose okay you're
bumped to get a guy in first base so
that
you know your second baseman could
advance the third and you get to do the
whole thing
um uh uh
maybe maybe maybe push
maybe just a line drive and uh you know
thrown out the real question is what the
hell is uncle frank
i never knew why daddy mac was so mean
to uncle frank he was the kind of person
i wanted to be
smart and funny and considerate you're
going to be the person you decide to be
are you going to be the person everyone
else tells you you get to choose
uncle frank is a new movie
i think it's on netflix or amazon i
think it's amazon
amazon original uh it starts paul
bettany
aka vision and it has a little girl
from it and it's like a coming-of-age
story coming out uncle frank
is a closeted homosexual in 1969
he lives in new york city he's a
professor uh with with more
you know progressive advanced
enlightened people and he
his family is from the redneck south
okay so i feel it
i don't know what it was based on i
think i don't think it's based on a
novel or anything it's about from alan
ball
i think he wrote it i think it's just
original screenplay okay this is weird
everything's based on a book
everything's based on a book now
or from some other source material i
think alan ball allen ball won an oscar
for american beauty
yeah he did the show six feet under um
there's always a
component of uh homosexuality and it
repressed homosexuality on lots of
different characters in his stuff so i
think that's that's his thing
he's he's the real samurovich
he's the real deal
this is ignorance and completely unfair
this country [ __ ] sucks it just
[ __ ] sucks
but this is paul bettany you know his
father
is is an [ __ ] a homophobic [ __ ]
he you know he the girl this
revolves around a funeral roles aren't a
funeral wow he's really treading new
ground with this one isn't he
he loves funerals he loves caskets and
dead bodies and overall
a lot of his stuff has been darker
more dramatic um more risky
and this felt kind of safe okay
feels like there's always kind of a i
don't know if whimsical is the right
word but there's something
a little unrealistic in a lot of his
stuff too like a
surreal element i don't know if that's
fantasy-like um dreamlike
yeah and this is this is more like
straight and narrow and it's more like
you know i don't know spoilers
i don't have time for this the girl is
is
is young she's about to go off to
college
but you know she's surrounded by
rednecks and
people that are just kind of stuck in
where they are and he sees potential in
her
she's smart she's she's she connects
with him
all of her other uncles are all just
like uh drink beer watch sports uh
hate them gays and the dad is the even
worse and he's
very enlightened and smart and he's like
come to new york come to this college
that i work at and
you know learn about the world and she
learns that he's gay and um
all sorts of stuff happens but then the
father passes away
the the homophobic awful father
and he has to go back for the funeral to
the to the podung town and then there's
a whole thing where
it comes out and at first everyone says
no and then it becomes like this like
warm
like happy ending wow
that's a high drama kind of corny a
little
sure this isn't a samurovich movie no no
i'm sure
is it better or worse than ben and
arthur it's better than betten arthur
but which would you rather watch again
but in our third so there you go
no the performances in this are all good
paul bentoni was
really good at uh american accents you
know it's one of those like
despite the heavy subject matter it's
kind of like a light watch
nobody nobody dies nobody gets murdered
boring
nobody just blows their head off with
the shotgun boring
expected some more uh some more gritty
[ __ ] from uh
alan ball i don't want to say a lifetime
movie that's too insulting
but you know just a little too well
wrapped up
not a lot of like um
more like canned dramatic situations
that seemed
uh below his uh his level of talent
uh well i watched a documentary called
belushi
which is of course a documentary about
dan aykroyd
because they were in that that movie
together men at work
yes exactly where they played garbage
men that was them
that was definitely them even when
things were difficult
he always promised that he would try to
do better i had to trust that he loved
me
now this is a show time you're talking
about all the bad showtime programming
but this was a showtime documentary
time programming i don't know i don't
aside from twin peaks i don't know i
think i've watched anything on showtime
until this documentary because i was
interested in seeing it because i've had
a long time fascination with john
belushi
um it's kind of that first generation of
like comedy actors because before that
you had like
bob newhart like jonathan winters like
these real straight laced guys and then
60s into the 70s you had the rise of you
know comedic actors that were more like
personalized for more like rock stars
and he was kind of the first big
casualty of that dying at the age of 33
from drug overdose very much a rock star
lifestyle because isn't that thing with
all rock stars die at the age of 33
isn't that a reoccurring thing 27 27 27.
oh you know what i'm thinking of
belushi and chris farley both died at
33.33 yes
um so it's it's i read the book wired in
high school which is
uh written by bob woodward about
belushi's life and
so a lot of the stuff in the documentary
had already known but it's kind of nice
to see it all
just contained in a very if you're not
familiar with him
covers just about everything it's
comprised of
audio interviews that were apparently
done for some sort of like oral history
thing
that was never made so you have people
like i don't know how long ago they were
recorded but you have people like harold
ramis and carrie fisher like
people that are now gone and they're
talking about him and
lots of photos and home movie stuff i
had never seen before
and no recreations well they did do some
animated segments
first like they show because he grew up
in wheaton illinois and
he had a band and so they showed like
animated segments of that and
it's pretty well done that's the new the
new thing to do in documentaries is
animation is there other than other
movies oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a
little
kind of artistically recreate something
as opposed to
hiring an actor and all that unless
you're talking about their stuff on the
reels
channel oh god they get some really good
look-alikes on the reels channel
those death of a celebrity documentaries
so good
so good i know there was a there was a
show called like
the last 48s do you remember that it's
like the last 48 hours and i only did
one on john belushi i don't think i ever
saw it
after filming neighbors belushi's
cocaine addiction took hold again
with each hit he was slowly killing
himself and on his final day
he was far from those who could have
saved him but they did a movie
adaptation of the book wired
it was only a few years after he died
and everybody in his life was like
outraged and the movie's terrible
[ __ ]
uh so up until this documentary that's
been the only kind of real
encapsulation of john belushi's life and
death and that movie's terrible
so this is good it's a good documentary
that covers pretty much everything has
lots of
his wife judith is involved she does a
lot of interview stuff so it's
it's good it's a good balance because i
know the book kind of deals mostly with
his
his uh substance abuse problems and then
his eventual death and it's a big part
of him but
this covers a lot of the early stuff and
a lot of his comedy things too to
balance it out
it's really well done
uh well jay you did not watch the
beastie boys documentary
i didn't add one of the few things on
apple plus
hello everyone what we're gonna do right
here is go back
way back back into time and you said you
you don't
really care much about the beastie boys
or you didn't know a lot about it that's
the thing is
is okay so it's not so much a
documentary it as it is a
recording of a live performance
uh or four you know they do they shoot a
bunch of them and they use the best bits
from all over
sure but uh yeah they're in a live
theater and the live
thing is directed by spike jones of
course okay um
and it's just it's it's almost like a
presentation they're showing
clips they're cut into stuff they're
narrating it
so i don't know anything about the
beastie boys i know the basics
of you know a couple other hit songs the
early stuff the
license to ill you know brass monkey uh
girls um i'll fight for your right to
party all
the old songs and then i know like oh
yeah they had some hits
in the 90s um you know and to me beastie
boys kind of always sounded like
you know yeah i mean i like fruit and
pebbles and i'm here to say
it never really hooked me you're the
first person to associate
the bc boys with a 30 year old fruity
pebbles commercial rap
i'm the master rapper and i'm here to
say i love fruity pebbles in a major way
yes the fruity pebbles commercial
because that's what was popular at the
time
and so of course uh uh adam
one of the beastie boys died uh he had
cancer he died
probably about five six years ago now uh
the two remaining bc boys are there
um and it's basically just like them on
stage
like going back from where they started
to where they are now and so now they're
58 year old men and they're all grown up
and in a strange way and it's it's it's
just
sort of vibes i got from lots of the
different things they've they
they brought up the it feels more
like mo it feels mostly like
a retrospective of their whole career
but in the same way
it feels like kind of an explanation
of all the things that they did and
said and how they acted and
why they did it we had a song on our
first record that was supposed to be
this like stupid
and ironic joke but understandably it
wasn't that funny
now i'm gonna tell you the lyrics to
that song
girls they had like it's just like
songs like the girls song girls to do my
laundry
yeah and they were very pointed and
saying oh weird that was a parody
of of dude bros that would sing a song
like that you know because you listened
to it today
yeah that came out today like nope
canceled immediately context is
completely
removed from everything and so they're
like and then for a big part of their
tour they had like a giant
penis inflatable penis on their stage
and all this like crazy
[ __ ] and they'd throw beer in the
audience and
and so they're like well okay when
the stage manager asked what do you want
on stage so we just came up with the
craziest [ __ ] just to see if it would
happen
and it's like okay
[Laughter]
sure you did so we didn't know what was
a joke and what wasn't a joke at that
time
i mean [ __ ] got really blurry ironically
the
the most interesting beastie boys the
one that died
um the other two i don't know were that
interesting but it was basically them
talking a lot about him
he was kind of like the guy who was just
like i'm i'm
going to research this i know all about
this and why does he have time to learn
all this stuff
he's really smart he's the guy who who
got in the tibetan
stuff i don't know if you remember any
of this vaguely
uh they did a like a free free tibet
stuff
kind of started with that guy yeah um
the the
free tibet concert with all the big rock
bands and
that happened in like the late 90s yeah
um he was the one that started that he
went met the dalai lama
and sort of like the i don't know john
lennon
of the group more culturally aware
of of the world around him as opposed to
just being a
musician yeah um and so
yeah it was sort of so it was like kind
of like a story of how they
evolved from being bratty
kids that like punk rock and rap
and were really immature because someone
like the old videos of them or something
cringy
oh sure but you know and then they're
now they're grown ups and they went
through this this
this process of um of growing up yeah
there's this whole
interesting segment where they discuss
how they
stopped for like two years and just
learned how to play instruments
and actually learn music because you
know they really didn't know that much
and they're like okay and they they
bought a studio and they lived in this
house in
los angeles and learned how to play
guitars and drums and bass and
like kind of experiment with different
sounds and so there's
evolution that's that's what's
interesting about them because
especially like starting that young you
compare it to a lot of the
like uh like the hair metal bands of the
80s where
you go to a county fair today and
they're still doing the same shtick
oh yeah they never really evolved that's
all they kind of know
so yeah that's that's always interesting
to see like a an artist or a group like
that that
it's constantly changing what they're
doing right right
um and lots of funny stuff i mean it's
really good it's really entertaining
um but in a small way i kind of felt
like
hey maybe we should explain ourselves
because let's get this all out there
before people start digging up our old
[ __ ]
chapter five dicks in a box
you mentioned like the hair metal bands
and like going back to like cringy stuff
and
i i forget which one of the beastie boys
it was being interviewed
and the interviewer said um well now you
you know you talk about
um you talk about women's rights and you
know
feminism and progressiveness and all
this but then when you go back and look
at
your old stuff and it's kind of like
smutty and dirty and filthy and childish
and
and all that and he's like don't you see
don't you think that's kind of uh
hypocritical don't you think you're a
hypocrite and and he's like he's like
i'd rather be a hypocrite than the same
person forever
there you go like that's uh
that's that's the point
so mike i have breaking news breaking
news
this will not be breaking news by the
time the video comes out because we have
to edit it
but uh this is literally this story came
out while we were filming this video
yeah we just took a break and i don't
know what he's going to tell me
uh warner brothers has announced that
their
entire slate of movies for 2021
will be put on hbo max concurrently with
theaters
the entire thing so that's [ __ ] like uh
uh was it the godzilla versus kong movie
mortal kombat [ __ ]
dune and matrix four what
they just this is this is a crazy
they've given up on theaters
well i mean they're gonna they say it's
gonna be concurrently with theaters
it'll be on hbo max for like a month and
then it'll be removed so you can see it
in theaters or on hbo max
oh okay oh wow so that's that's a pretty
[ __ ] big deal we were talking earlier
about wonder woman and so it's funny
that that happened
while we were filming this discussion of
everything being on streaming
hmm that's a that's like bigger than
just
wonder woman going to hbo max that's
like
a game-changing move that's like the
death rattle of theaters even more so
than than it's been
yeah yeah we don't know what a post
covered world looks like though jay
maybe everyone just wants to go to
theaters all the time because of
because of being cooped up for a year
yeah and it could be like
which is why it's smart of them to say
they'll be in theaters too
yes and and it's something they can
always change that's true yeah um
so it could be a situation where it's
like i don't know a
competing movie company and a paramount
or whatever they have no uh
what's coming out soon oh well let's say
black widow movie they decide to release
it in theaters
after everybody has been vaccinated june
right sure and just those gangbusters
it brings in a billion dollars two
billion dollars and then and then they
go
maybe that doing movie we should put on
the theaters you know
dune of all of those dune is like the
one that i mean that that's
denis villeneuve he's uh
visionary meant to be seen on a huge
screen so that being hbo max is a pretty
big deal well i wonder how
that will affect like filmmakers
wanting to work with certain studios
like especially like your christopher
nolan's because warner brothers is who
he is associated with
the tenant and the batman movies and
what like if if christopher nolan has
like a big project he wants to do
in the future you know and
he knows it's going to be on people's
home tvs instead of on imax
he might shy away from that everything's
changing
it'll be funny i was looking at the list
of movies they're releasing and like
when theaters finally do reopen like he
said maybe june or something
mid-year when things are completely open
again and one of the movies that's
slated to come out
is the hybrid live-action animated tom
and jerry movie
what if that's the first one to come out
in theaters and it makes like two
billion dollars because everybody just
wants to go see a movie
and that's the movie that saves theaters
the movie that killed theaters was tenet
and the movie that revives them is
tom and jerry that'd be hilarious that'd
be pretty [ __ ] funny
