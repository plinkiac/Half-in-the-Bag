half in the bag I think in 30 years you'll look back on the David Gordon green movies and think that he was a
genius out of all quality Oktoberfest beers out
there you get Sam [ __ ] Adams it's literally the only one I could find you
know how many people craft breweries make oktoberfests and you get Sam Adams
what are you [ __ ] stupid look I went to so many I went to one store and this
is what they had our current will get the cap off because of my arthritis hey why are you wearing
that silly hat are you trying to be like the sheriff from these Halloween movies who put this on there one of my coat
rack is Obama still president hey did you hear they made a new Halloween movie I
bet Jamie Lee Curtis is spinning in her grave come on let's go
Halloween ends ruins the mythology of the Halloween franchise by barely having
Michael Myers in it it is the worst Halloween movie since Halloween kills ruined the mythology of the franchise
with that evil dies tonight nonsense evil dies tonight
which is the worst Halloween movie since Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 ruined the
mythology of the franchise by having a metaphorical White Horse and even having Michael Myers talk
which is the worst Halloween movie since Rob Zombie's Halloween gave Michael
Myers a white trash backstory and mommy issues which is the worst Halloween movie since
Halloween resurrection ruined the mythology of the franchise by having Michael Myers get his ass kicked by
Buster Rhymes trick or treat [ __ ] which is the worst
Halloween movie since Halloween 6 ruined the mythology of the franchise with that Cult of thorn BS what were you thinking
Paul Rudd which is the worst Halloween movie since I'll since Halloween 3 season of The Witch
ruined the mythology of the franchise by not having Michael Myers even in it bring back Michael Myers we need to see
him do the same [ __ ] over and over and over again which is the worst Halloween movie since Halloween 2 ruined the
mythology of the franchise by making Michael Myers and Lori strobe brother and sister thus eliminating the Mystique
of Michael as a motiveless monster what a franchise what a legacy John Carpenter
is spinning in his grave great okay
we were spinning in his grave spinning in their grave no that's perfect
that's why it's funny they're all spinning in their graves well Mike it's the Halloween season
there's a new Halloween movie out definitely the last Halloween movie that
they're ever gonna make I can't believe this epic Saga is coming to a conclusion and that they're not
going to make any more of these I really like this movie and everyone's
gonna hate me for liking it I won't because I really liked it too what it might be one of my favorite Halloween
movies I've already got that I like Jurassic world brand on my
talking forehead forever hey I'm with you on this one okay but we'll we'll
talk all about it we're going to talk all about this um after the last two David Gordon green
uh masterpieces masterpieces I got peanut butter on my penis uh this
uh was a very very different film and so if you're if you're uh tuning in or or
if you're gonna watch Halloween ends in the hopes that it's the fine well it
kind of is the final showdown between Loris Road and my Michael Myers walking
around town and Halloween night stabbing people this is a totally different direction uh
and uh so spoiler alert uh we we do recommend Halloween ends
it's sloppy there's it's got problems but we both enjoyed it they both enjoyed it um we laughed a lot sometimes
intentionally sometimes not right and um uh so there's that so if you want to
watch it uh wait till after the first ad break to go watch the video
to go watch the film or whatever it is film video The Epic conclusion to the
David Gordon green Trilogy Mike right which is the biggest problem is that's how they were promoting it uh the the
the we're in spoiler territory now um everything about this was yeah the
final showdown between Lori Strode and Michael Myers the Epic conclusion even though we already got a pretty
satisfying showdown in the Halloween 2018 right that was like a singular movie I think I said that when it came
out like yeah they have an idea uh they kind of reverse the roles of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode she's a
more of the aggressor she's the stalker there's lots of shots that parallel the first movie but now it's with Lori
instead of him boom that's your idea that's your movie got it um but of course that was a very
successful movie so here come the sequels Halloween kills dog [ __ ] now
he's turning us into monsters confusing nonsense that's a mess
so I did not have high hopes for this movie and they were promoting it everything in the promotion for this
movie is based on the tact on Final 15 minutes of this film yes which has
almost nothing to do with the rest of the story and it's the worst part of the movie even though on its own it's kind
of schlocky and funny no
but it feels disconnected from everything else yeah I I saw I didn't see the trailer I didn't see anything I
saw maybe like a 10 second TV ad or something like I I remember seeing her
like ah I'm gonna get you and let's it's all promoted Michael Myers yeah the poster is the two of them back to back
this is the wonderful balance of a wonderful example of the balance of of
people wanting more of the same complaining that it's more of the same but then when they don't get more of the
same they complain yes that's the that's why I like this movie because the balance weird Balancing Act of sequels
Yeah well yeah exactly you don't want to you don't want to go too far uh in into like you know Halloween three
Season of the Witch territory but you can go there that's fine no no that movie's great well it's a standalone movie it's it's fine but it's a sequel
to Halloween yeah yes um but and you don't want to just you know make
endless Jaws sequels where there's no like plot progression or you know you
want to like a saga that that unfolds and and as we've discussed many times
before the Michael Myers movie is a standalone movie Halloween boom it's up there with jaws it's the thing that
killed somebody it's a one movie thing you're done you're never gonna make The Empire Strikes Back off of any of these
kind of movies right you're just gonna repeat the same thing Fred Nightmare on Elm Street it repeated the same thing
forever but they did it with some cleverness some imagination yeah those those movies are mostly pretty fun and
and this I was like oh God Halloween kills was like
like you said what did you say dog [ __ ] I think I said dog [ __ ] okay
howling kills is something only Divine would eat
it's literally like it was so bad bafflingly bad bafflingly bad like 2018
wasn't great but it was it was pretty good it was okay they were like stumbling and struggling to find some
kind of um like Focus or or like theme with the with the sequel um but the mentality I
guess yeah they came up with but it was executed so poorly and we're seeing it everywhere
with the black lives matter movement
now he's turning us into monsters I didn't really get any sort of like uh
heavy-handed theme from this one it has themes but it was themes that make it
themes were apolitical yeah well they they make it more interesting and tied in with the original movie in a way that
works better than all the sequels because the sequels are going all the way back to Halloween too John Carpenter
I don't know what do we do I'm gonna get drunk and write the script uh Lori Strode and Michael Myers brother and
sister know oh now we all now he has motivation that's what makes him boring yeah
Michael Myers with motivation is is uh the exact opposite of that first movie
yeah and then every sequel builds from that oh he's been uh led by a cult of
pagans or whatever they didn't know what to do with them they didn't know what to do with it so this movie is like okay uh
well the 2018 one goes back to no they're not brother and sister uh he is a motiveless killer again and Laurie
Strode kind of keeps getting in his way and that's the idea but there is no deeper connection between the two of
them and then what this movie does that makes it more interesting to me is the idea of this evil being transferable or
uh contagious I think they say contagious in the movie and he looks at me
and it's not him at least not in the eyes
blank pale emotionless face and the blackest eyes
the devil's eyes and and because of the environment that has been kind of cultivated in Haddon fields and Fields
like a character in the movie in a way that is hasn't been in the other movies that's just where they took place it's a
Castle Rock yes like like early on everyone's like miserable they're showing like people
are committing suicide and like the the that cloud of Michael Myers has hung over this town and now he's gone and so
people need another direction to point their anger at so they they pointed at this kid that
accidentally killed a small child that he was babysitting thank you
what was that it boiled it down to what is the essence
or nature of evil right and and I think Jamie Lee Curtis says it and she's like it's well it's some kind of outside
force that's attacking you or it comes from within and and then it goes to like
the very nature of how Michael Myers was created AKA The Shape he didn't have a
name in the first one related the credit still you could do this column the shape because he's not a person anymore right
um he he became pure evil why we don't know and that's kind of what this movie examines we we get introduced to our
main character Corey Cunningham who is a young young man who's on his
way to becoming an engineer he's got glasses he's smart he's Halloween night
he's earning a little babysitting bucks you know yeah he's a young college student working his way up doing odd
jobs he decides to help them out babysitting and there's an incident in the beginning again we're in spoiler
territories so uh because because that was the fun of the very beginning it's Halloween
we're gonna have a good time tonight yeah is I really was like settled in for
oh Michael Myers is in the house yeah I'm like I'm I'm gonna go to sleep he's
walking around something crazy happens where he accidentally kills the kitties babysitting this horrific incident and
it [ __ ] up the course of his life yeah but it's still sort of has a connection to Michael Myers because there's this uh
Legacy of Michael Myers This is the year later after the last two movies and so there's just this fear of him and the
kid is pulling a prank on the babysitter uh by making him think Michael Myers is your house so that was interesting too
there's like oh Michael Myers has nothing to do with this yeah and it works as almost like a little short film in its own right and it inverts with the
first one where he kills his sister with the butcher knife and then he this kid kills a kid
um and then uh so his life is kind of like ruined from there but there's all these like little like
little moments of uh you know he has an alliterative name Corey Cunningham
Michael Myers he works at a garage mechanic uh junkyard mechanic shop and
he's wearing the mechanics uniform and there's this like little hints that he's going to become the new Michael Myers
and his life is is crap because people treat him badly because of the accident
and it was technically an accident but it just you know it's nature versus nurture kind of thing which is mentioned
in the movie too it's like what what course does your life change and what events cause you to let the evil inside
consume you it's very like Star Wars like the dark side follow the path you're going down the wrong path even
goes into a little cave kind of he's like he's like Anakin Skywalker with his hair I feel the evil inside me bad me I can't
control it um so that there was like like this whoa what's going on I like this yeah
see how to do it
get up Michael Myers lives in a sewer he's been living in a sewer for five
years well I made a joke while we were watching it because that's the thing that they nobody really talks about with the last two movies is that Michael
Myers is like 65 years old and he's in two movies he's still walking around slashing people superhuman strength it's
it's supposed to be a more grounded movie but they're not he goes and crawls into a sewer and just sort of lives in
there like a like a homeless man yeah uh which kind of Echoes I think that's how Halloween 5 starts doesn't it he's like
living in a little Shack with this old man that can't remember the Halloween five [ __ ] sucks
okay woman but yeah so so having him be and I don't know maybe people are like
oh Michael Myers he's a pathetic in this movie it's like that's fine this is so
great his power is being transferred to somebody else and he's gaining more power there's the one uh the the cop
that keeps hitting on what's her name Allison and they lure him uh Corey Lewis him down into the sewer Michael kills
him and it's like he gets a little bit of uh yeah Rejuvenation it's like Darth Sidious and Anakin Skywalker sure and
Michael Myers doesn't kill this kid Corey he they kind of like work together almost in the strange like relationship
it's great because you identify with the Corey character he's just some kid who's
trying to earn babysitting money and he and and his life goes off the rails and
the the interesting part with this movie is that all the victims are like
horrible monsters that you want to see get killed they're bullies yeah the the
there's a little group of four high school kids that um bully Corey and you
know the one character the girl is kind of nice to him but I think she survives
the one that gets ran over by the judge oh really smashes her head he Stomps on her head yes after she Witnesses he gets
the blow torch in his mouth there's some pretty gruesome deaths in this which are like fun they were making us laugh yeah
they were they were like so gruesome the DJ yes he smashes his head against the
turntable so hard his jaw falls off and then it cuts his tongue out the tongue's making the record Skip and it's playing
one of my favorite songs by The Cramps so that made it even better what's really getting here your favorite song
stuck in your head so so yeah there's there's the the doctor the the doctor
and the the the [ __ ] nurse who's sleeping with the doctor to get
promotions there's the four bullies there's the horrible cop who's like very aggressively hitting on uh what's her
name Allison Allison yeah and she's like not interested so all these characters the victims in the movie are awful yeah
so you're sort of like in that weird position where you're kind of like siding with the bad guy and um and
really Michael Myers just like kind of just out of power and dead in the sewer
like and this kid sort of just like absorbing his like evil Essence because
his life is just he just can't take it anymore it's just like one disappointment after the other and then
his relationship with the girl and Lori's like I don't know I sense the dark side in you I don't know if you
should be dating my granddaughter you're breaking my heart Anakin it was weird when she said that in the film it was uh
no it's all very uh I think I mentioned it while we were watching it's very Christine another John Carpenter movie the kid's last name is Cunningham the
junkyard the bullies yeah except instead of a car that's that's turning him evil
it's pathetic uh sewer dwelling Michael Myers yes and I was like oh boy I like
the direction that this is going I don't mind I don't mind a really good passing of the torch
I think Studio types get nervous about that yeah well yeah anytime you break
from formula the end of the first season of Star Trek Picard
Captain Picard dies and then they're like well he's dead let's transfer his Consciousness and let's make a robot
replica of him I'm like oh they're gonna Patrick Stewart's 96 years old they're going to get a younger actor and he's
going to have the Consciousness and memories of Captain Picard and a younger body and he's going to continue on being
the new Captain Picard that's really that's a great idea let's do that
nope someone got nervous and said don't they never mention again that he's technically a robe they kind of sweep it
under the rug there's a couple little lines here and there but let's make a robot that's just
as old looks as just as in uh just as feeble and will probably die around the
same time as his normal biological body so what's the event I don't know what
what um why not use that opportunity to re recast him and you know have uh
you can do flashbacks or have maybe have Patrick Stewart's voice in his head or something crazy I don't [ __ ] who cares but this was the perfect
opportunity to use Corey Cunningham to become a new Michael Myers like evil this is [ __ ] Lori Strode says at the
end she's like evil never dies it just changes form I've said goodbye to my
Boogeyman but the truth is evil doesn't die evil
dies tonight the evil never dies it just changes form and this it doesn't change form it dies
I'm sure that was the original intention of David Gordon Green's script yeah I
have no doubt in my mind but then someone said we have to have Larry fight Michael yeah Michael who's done almost
nothing for the whole movie other than be a catalyst for the story which was fine with me that was great but then
yeah he shows up at the end they have a pointless battle which is kind of fun out of context it was funny
yeah we're in spoilers I guess we've been in spoilers but that that final shot of
Michael Myers going into the comically large meat grinder was so funny
I think that was supposed to be I think that was supposed to be kind of poignant but uh no
just I was very pleased with the transformation of a random character yeah well that's the surprising thing
too and I think that's probably why some people were turned off as like oh this is the final chapter of a Trilogy which
is like why is it a Trilogy what does it matter um so like the idea that oh we're in the last movie and we're being introduced
Corey's essentially the protagonist Laurie's like a side character her granddaughter is a side character which
is fine so the idea in like the final chapter of this Trilogy to completely shift Focus if Corey had floated in and
out of all three movies and they teased it from the beginning yeah they're just talking out of their asses oh yeah this
is this is the uh the most recent Star Wars Trilogy yes it was not planned out nothing was planned this was planned
let's make a new Trilogy let's bring Michael Myers back and let's have him over the course of three films uh slowly
transfers evil to this new character for me it worked in the context of one film but they they got weakened the knees and
didn't finish it yeah they said no we can't do that everyone will be angry they need to see Lori fight Michael I'm
so [ __ ] sick of this yeah that's that's to me and and so I I read some
comments you know because it has bad reviews you know no one's going to review this well but comments are like
and I'm like did you not like the ending because they didn't go fully with this
new plot line are you that smart or did you not like the ending because there wasn't enough Lori fighting Michael I I
think that's probably it anytime you hear like the fact that Michael is so like sad and pathetic in this movie the
fact that most of the killings are done by a new character that's the idea of that uh that that evil transcending
Michael and and kind of taking over somebody else is what made this feel so fresh and interesting for a Halloween
movie because all these how many times have we seen yeah I know you like Halloween for it's okay as far as like a
soft reboot reboot goes it's fine but it's just the same [ __ ] yeah over it and
this this grab that Michael Myers concept and and actually expanded on the
whatever this is the concept of evil as opposed to yeah why is well now we
should explain why Michael kills people yeah oh this is a bloodline thing it's a cult thing like who cares Michael Myers
is the least interesting character he's a catalyst for for Terror right and that's what he is in the first movie and
that's what he is in this movie even though he's barely in it yeah and they're like the little love story between the characters like Allison is
now living with Laurie Strode in a house Lori bought a house a regular house yes not a fortress she's not paranoid
anymore she's happy she's taking her Activa she's going to the senior center she's like I'm not scared of Michael
even though he really didn't die in the last one we don't know where the [ __ ] he is but I'm fine everything's fine
um I'm telling my granddaughter live a normal life you know be happy I'm gonna do it I'm gonna work as a nurse and then
I'm gonna get my promotion you know like I passed over for a promotion by this like Airhead bimbo that's [ __ ] the
doctor and she knows it yeah and and so she's like [ __ ] she's she's getting fed up with the town she keeps getting hit
on by the stupid cop yeah people are gross and awful here and so she starts the side with the loner Outsider you
could see her very easily turning into an accomplice and also becoming a killer yeah she's like let's burn this 10 down
and she's like I'll let the match and that's the Techno music starts playing they're riding the bike I'm like what is
this it was like drive it was Nicholas winding reference yeah I was thinking to drive and then uh which I thought maybe
was just a coincidence but they're driving around they're listening to like synth pop music yeah and then uh Corey
crushes that guy's head or because that lady's head with his foot which is exactly what Ryan Gosling doesn't drive
right he's like is this intentionally this is like Halloween meets Drive meets Romeo and Juliet he's Star Wars Star
Wars yeah that's fine it's weird it was great
um for this far into the Halloween franchise for someone to finally try and Veer into a different direction
not including part three only to have only have the rug pulled out from under them in the last 10 minutes by a studio
Executives I cannot believe and I don't know if I'm right or wrong I don't
really care I just in my heart of hearts I cannot believe that he would have
chosen to end the film the way he did yeah I had an I had a thought watching this and um
because because the the kid Corey is walking around with the Michael Myers mask and he shows up Lori strode's house
she does this weird thing where she's like I'm gonna kill myself 9-1-1 I'm gonna kill myself because she
knows like Michael's coming or whatever might even call anybody I don't know because the what's his face well Pat him
the cop he's like we got a suicide call from Maurice Road it's like just if you're just trying to fool him just
pretend to make a phone call I don't know that was weird I don't even know how she knew he was there whatever but but so the Corey kid shows up at Lori
strode's house and they have a little uh altercation did you really think I killed myself
and then he's like he's like I want to leave town with your dog your granddaughter like you can't have her no
one will and he stabs himself yeah any case he's he's gone Pure Evil and he's got the Michael Myers
mask and he dies there and um even I wish he would have just gotten shot and like at the end of the film
they throw Michael Myers in a meat grinder and then once Michael Myers just gets
like shredded to a pulp what's his head bursts then you cut to Corey just
sitting straight up yeah hard cut the black end there's your sequel base so
you can keep this going but everyone will say 90 of this is a very interesting movie
and I was shocked because I was getting something I just totally didn't expect and then you have this weird like
a loner weirdo Rebel guy who gets corrupted by evil and Michael's living
in the sewers and teaching him the ways of the dark side and going to transfer his evilness which is like I'm so okay
with that yeah like let let him pass the map let him get a new mask
which was fun that was like it was very retro in a way that's not like I don't know stranger things Nostalgia overload
it just made me think of like the the endless slasher movies of the early 80s everyone has their look for that one
scene he's got a scarecrow mask I was like Ah that's neat I have Corey Cunningham this is the new Michael Myers I don't care like Michael Myers is so
old just stop and and and the overall theme of it though was pretty solid like like a good
kid who's just working hard has a horrible accident and people that sort
of like fear or paranoia or like the way people are
treated Yeah well yeah I like all the little side characters in this the town like I said the town is is really
fleshed out and like the idea of yeah the people need a new uh a new scapegoat
for their anger Michael Myers is out of the picture now so he's our new we're going to vilify this kid yeah there's no
kindness or understanding from the town they're just like cruel I really like that moment outside the grocery store
Lori's walking to her car and we have the the lady from the last movie that got a [ __ ] fluorescent tube shoved
into her throat she's still alive and her sister resents Lori because Lori's still around and Michael Myers isn't
you're her neighbor and you don't even know her name do you you tempted and you provoke that man
when you should have left him alone yeah yeah they say at one point uh I think that's the DJ who says it he says
something like your grandma riled up a man with some kind of brain injury or
mental illness or something yes and um got everybody killed because she riled him up not not just like it's clear-cut
good and evil but he kind of comes up with a reasoning you know and and so what is what is evil what is the nature
of it to me the the bully teenagers were evil not Corey yeah well Corey confronts
the one about that yeah where he's like your dad's an [ __ ] to you so now you're being an [ __ ] to me yes and
then add on the Corey's uh household he's got the weird overbearing mother
foreign oh no no uh who kisses him on the mouth I don't
want him seeing girls you know it's just a creepy and so yeah that goes into nature versus nurture like what what
like do you get [ __ ] up by your upbringing or just one specific event or
like a culmination of things the snowball you know we talked about that during the Dahmer discussion yeah so the
fact that we're having like like a somewhat thoughtful discussion on like the nature of Evil
based on a stupid movie a stupid Halloween movie the 13th Halloween movie it's like it's like an amazing
achievement yeah and everybody hates it and everybody hates it and I
like I can't just give it a glowing recommendation based on the last 20
minutes I just I was not happy with the fact that he got Corey dies and that we
have to switch gears it was like we're driving on a race car and they just hit the brakes yeah we got out and then we
went and got on like like a slow moving bus like the race car was like headed
towards the finish line and they just they just pulled the parking brake and made us get out and get on a tandem
bicycle by John Carpenter
look why did you do that to us you were you were out you were ready to achieve
they were trying to have their cake and eat it too we want to do something different but we know what people want so we'll tack that on at the end like I
don't get it I know
when in a New Direction introduced new ideas that to me are more in line with the spirit of the original movie than
most of the shitty sequels evil what is it what is evil yeah
it's a shape no reason no conscience no understanding and even the most
rudimentary sense of life or death of good or evil right or wrong it has no
purpose it has no no motivation uh whatever and this explored that a little
I I thought when he they're in the sewer he he's him and Michael Myers are like
wrestling yeah it was a little awkward it's a weird scene it just cuts to them and they're just like kind of like
fighting and it's very like like Primal
and then he walks away and I just thought Michael Myers was just gonna just die
maybe that was the original idea who knows just died he just wasn't going to be in the rest of the movie yeah that
would have been perfect I would have been happy with that he just dies but Mike he's an
iconic movie villain you've got to bring him back he's got to be Michael Myers forever well I guess that's not true
because then they do kill him at the end but it doesn't matter they'll reboot this in two years um I'm sorry we didn't hate this movie
everybody I'm not sorry I don't care I'm happy to have a new Halloween movie that
I actually enjoyed there are some really fun kills in it it had a yeah yeah even on that one watch this like it goes I
like how long it takes before it gets to that stuff it's like an hour into the movie aside from the opening credits
before the Halloween theme kicks in
it's like okay you built up to this it feels earned that's nice like I said I'm sorry we didn't hate it
we're not ripping on it we we watch a movie and we say how we feel about it that's all with no no like agenda or any
any kind of no one's more surprised that I really like this movie than me so yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm I feel surprised as
well but it's bittersweet because I feel disappointed as well at the end someone needs to do a fan edit where the movie
just cuts the credits right when he shoves the Corey shoves the knife in his neck if I can't have her
just cut to credits it still wouldn't be a satisfying onion
but at least it wouldn't sit through 15 minutes of [ __ ] yeah yeah well he he he he stabs himself the
daughter leaves right she sees that he makes it look like Lori killed him yeah
the dog the granddaughter like says my guide Larry Grandma you [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm leaving the movies like like a
family drama like a misunderstanding family drama but then Lori like kind of slumps to the ground she picks up her
gun just to double check she doesn't have a bullet left in it that's when you cut the granite
foreign
comes in and sees Lori with the knife it's like oh Allison's going to try and kill her now and now she'll turn evil
remember the end of Halloween four that was a solid ending where the little girl kills or stabs them yeah she's got the
clown mask on you thought she was going to be Dr Loomis is like oh no not again yes yes that's a great ending even
though I thought the rest of the movie was just kind of mediocre but that's a solid ending and then they completely they push that aside for the the fifth
one well now it's much worse not like nowadays it's it's true yeah
before you'd make a movie and put it in the theater trick people to go see it with a trailer
and now everyone has an opinion anyway would you recommend
a Halloween ends I would there's got to be people out there that appreciate the the different
take and like I said I think this is closest in spirit to the original movie as far as themes and ideas it's not just
Michael Myers stabbing people again so I'm gonna say it's one of my favorite Halloween movies wow which isn't a high
bar to pass but I also love Halloween three which that's people come around on
that one it used to be everybody hated it because Michael Myers wasn't in it and over time people realized on its own
it's a pretty fun movie sure um so yeah the the weirder the Halloween sequels the more I tend to like them and
it had some nice atmosphere that whole opening like we mentioned it's like a little short film or something lots of
uh I just think of like Halloween kills as being so kind of and I guess it's partially intentional but still like
kind of chaotic and ugly visually this one felt a little classier yeah I have a
look 100 agree with you on all those points it felt like a completely different filmmaker made it yeah just
had this different I noticed that during the opening credits there was which the opening credits were cool too by the way the little pumpkin uh yes pumpkins
bursting out of other pumpkins kind of showing evil or whatever continuing um but I noticed there was because the
other two were Danny McBride and David Gordon green and they were credited as writers but so were two additional
writers on this one so I wonder if they brought in a couple other guys to help them kind of Polish it up and get rid of
the terrible dialogue there's no evil dies tonight in this movie and no like bizarre besides made an arrangement with
the Vietnamese Folks at the restaurant and had them make you your very own peanut butter and jelly bun me sandwiches like what characters just
randomly talk about things that have nothing to do with sandwiches for 15 minutes yeah yeah there was the weird
part where the guy was watching a hard target Jean-Claude Van Damme oh yeah that was a little odd but this little
cat jumps up on the yeah it's just to establish that he's in that room because then they cut to the exteriors yes I
like the because David Gordon green a lot of his older movies too he has these kind of little eccentric kind of Side
characters or shots or whatever but with Halloween 2018 there was just like way
too much bad humor um and this one had a good balance of it
was eccentric in a way that worked that just kind of made the town seem off yeah in a in an interesting way yeah without
being like super distracting yeah in a horror movie and it's like why are you trying to do something funny what is
this what this doesn't make sense it's just a shame about that ending
I think we dislike the ending for the completely opposite reason why other people disliked it I I don't know but I
don't know um they they had a chance for Brilliance and they mostly mostly did it
despite the fact that many people were disappointed that the old Michael Myers didn't just stab people again the whole
time the way this movie was shot and a lot of the details in the script are pretty good actually it's a little
anti-hero film about transformation and the nature of what makes people evil a
shockingly thoughtful premise coming right after the embarrassingly bad Halloween kills
let's talk about the general motif of change and all the symbolism themes of
transformation are all over the place the obvious one is the Catalyst family in the opening scene the dad at the
beginning is playing the piano in his mansion
later on we see him playing pool in some filthy bar same with the mom and her
downfall the house itself visually is a symbol of negative change
and the piano keys is a motif that's repeated foreign
so this is our inciting incident what caused this the little brat kid
that's who and the other overbearing mother in the film she warns Corey that her kid is scared of stuff and he what's
the bad Jeremy's been afraid of dork turns out he's a mean little prick that
loves violence Gore and teasing people here's the first awful person in this
town that's turned rotten it's time to lock your doors it's literally a little
werewolf that changes form at night he wears a mask there are many indications
of the importance of masks in this film stemming from the Halloween theme of
course Allison claims to quote not have a costume at one point do you have your costume for the party I told you I don't
want to go alone so I'm not going indicating that she's an open person who isn't hiding anything
unlike her doctor boss and that shameful nurse who ironically dress in their own
sort of costumes at work hiding deep dark secrets underneath and at the Doctor's house their true nature is
revealed a monstrous pervert and a gold-digging set when Allison finally
does get a mask or disposition and motivations change
so let's quickly talk about some visual motifs parallels and basic setups and payoffs
to set up the malfunctioning microwave that blows up food when you try to cook it it sees later to startle Michael so
that the worst Road could attack them they also set up the location of the
fire extinguisher when Lori Burns her Halloween pie or whatever so we know it's there and it just didn't come out
of nowhere when she grabs it to beat Michael Myers with it before throwing a refrigerator on them
and also Allison's car makes a rattling sound it's mentioned many times throughout the film so my car's been
rattling rattling pulled you over because it looks like your Muffler's about to fall off better get that fixed for you I have a bigger problem this is
what Corey hears outside at the end which indicates that he knows that it's Allison that's pulling up outside the
house that's what makes him stab himself in the throat the frame the grandma Laura Strode and ruin their relationship
and one final Act of evil in the beginning the kid throws a paper
airplane at Corey later in the film when Cory's in the abandoned house Laurie Strode is there rocking on the chair she
also throws the paper airplane this is a callback to indicate that Lori really isn't there she's inside Corey's head
Corey sleeps on the floor of the empty house in the exact spot where the kid died he then dies in basically the same
spot but in a different house his character's descent is visually and metaphorically displayed by images of
him at the top of the stairs at the start of the film and then the bottom of the stairs at the end now there are the
obvious visual Clues to compare Michael Myers and Corey Cunningham but some of the more noteworthy ones are Cory wears
a mechanics uniform just like Michael Myers his name is also alliterative CC
and mm in Halloween 4 Michael Myers steals a tow truck and in this film
Corey uses one to kill people with also in a similar POV shot from the
original Halloween Corey grabs a kitchen knife out of the drawer to kill his mother when the dad of the Dead child is
talking in the bar about trying to forgive Corey very prominently behind him are neon dice on the wall their
numbers add up to 12. in numerology the number 12 stresses the importance of ridding your life of negative energies
and in toxic relationships leaving a bad job and approaching all situations with
a new optimistic attitude
then let's take a look at some transformation Clues now it's no secret Corey is transforming into something
evil it's the [ __ ] plot of the movie but the script has some lovely subtleties in it first off of course the
pumpkins in the opening credit sequence symbolize evil changing shape or taking
on a new form there's a mention of the death tarot card early on in the film Oh no I got the death card no that just
means a major phase is ending and a new one was about to begin there's a better visual symbolism of him transforming
from his regular pedal bike to a more powerful motorcycle how's she getting rid of the bike so if
you want it you can have it I got a motorcycle which is given to him by one of the few people in the town that are
actually nice to him his dad or stepdad or whatever that weird looking pear-shaped man is Gory also loses his
glasses because it gets Stepped On by the bullies usually when a character has a change of vision in a movie it's a
pretty obvious metaphor for seeing the world differently now Cory likes chocolate milk but in the film he never
gets to drink it in the beginning he takes out the carton but doesn't get a chance to open it and then he purchases
a bottle at the gas station which leads to the most important scene in the whole film the moment that Corey finally snaps
I know who you are it is something messy I can't believe they let you off you're that psycho babysitter what
squeezes the glass milk bottle and it breaks in his hand now this whole scene happens right in front of an ice machine
with a giant logo for something called Triangle Ice a triangle represents
manifestation Enlightenment Revelation and a higher perspective it is often
used to Mark the cycles of growth that lead to a higher state of being our Egyptians viewed pyramids in the same
way that's why they were used as tombs a vehicle for transcending beyond the
human form into something new and greater Corey's caught on his hand is mentioned to be infected Laura calls
evil an infection the suffering Michael cause became an infection passing on to people who never even crossed his path
Allison says about his wound I want to get infected then later she looks at his hand and just says
infected this is also no doubt meant to be a parallel of the Christian concept
of stigmata and corys of eventual crucifixion by the towns and lorries
ideals and paranoia Dynasty Corey was always fascinated with transcending he
wanted to attend college and become something better after that failed he talked about the
radio tower and reaching the top of it that Tower if I could climb at the top
the radio tower is later seen on fire the radio tower and its importance was also foreshadowed in Halloween kills
this repeated theme or idea of the radio station and the DJ broadcasting also
comes into play it works as a metaphor for the external evil that Lori spoke of
in the house you know they're two kinds of evil there's the evil that exists as an external force that threatens the
well-being of the tribe the other kind of evil lives inside us like a sickness or an infection gory is affected by the
constant negative energy of the Town constantly permeating his brain the
bullies the people whispering about him and generally being ostracized it
Burrows into him like an ear worm like a song or like an annoying radio DJ and
what's really getting here your favorite song stuck in your head lastly Corey dies by his own hand and a
final gesture of a love that is forbidden Larry Strode Ironically in trying to stop evil created it
that's right I didn't even scare him waiting for Allison
two ill-fated lovers Corey and Allison struggled to find their place in Haddonfield they did everything they
could do to fit in and live normal lives but they struggled done finally one free
of their confines and allowed to be themselves they get pulled right back down by the paranoid mask wearing
fearful town that is haddenfield and Laurie Strode
oh and then Michael Myers pointlessly shows up to fight Lori and they throw him in a meat grinder yeah
