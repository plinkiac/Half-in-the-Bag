half in the bag
what do you got there jay oh since uh
godzilla versus kong is out
i thought i'd go back and revisit all
the other movies in the monster verse
oh you know godzilla 2014
kong skull island godzilla king of the
monsters
oh yes and dick shark
why that's funny i was also about to
watch dick shark
all right oh it's staying in
no this is not porn
porn doesn't look like this if you
equate nudity with
porn you are immature godzilla vs
kong is the most absurd movie that
director adam wingard has ever made
it combines tragedy comedy science
fiction
exploitation and surrealism
don't let the vulgar title fool you
yes there is an abundance of nudity but
there is also a bizarre mixture of
concepts that make for quite an
experimental film
see what can happen when creativity has
to replace a big
budget
uh hi you watched godzilla
versus king kong yes we just watched it
on our
huge tv 27-inch television
yeah i mean it's great it's streamed
right to hbo max
100 and 1 000 people saw it
although some people did see it in
theaters it's like the highest grossing
movie of the pandemic
well it made like like almost 10 million
opening day wow which i guess is pretty
good for right now
yeah well i mean like pandemic is i
guess slowing down a little so
starting to people are getting their
vaccines people can go back to the movie
this this
felt like a movie like it was the first
movie where i was like oh
i should be watching this in a theater
it's like brand new and it felt like
that
you know i mean it is one of those big
tentpole blockbuster movies and
this kind of feels weird not watching it
in the theater
i don't know if that would make any
difference it helps well the sound would
make a difference before we get into the
movie we never
we don't talk about sound very much but
after watching the other
movies recently as well which we both
did separately
the sound for this movie was a lot
beefier and a lot more
took a lot more advantage of the
surround sound and like overhead
speakers and stuff
like godzilla's tail will flip past you
and you hear it go above your head
and the sound mix was wonderful and the
number of people who have a
pimped out dolby atmos surround sound
system in their home
is five that's that's okay if you have a
little like
like a you know 20 inch tv just turn it
up really loud okay
that they'll create the same reason
create the same effect with a little
michael scott
like flat screen a lot of people in the
room you need more space
voila right into the wall wow uh well
what what did you think of the film
uh this is both a pro and a con
it felt like it was written by a child
the actual the titular godzilla versus
kong stuff
in the best way possible felt like a
little kid just smashing toys together
especially the last like 45 minutes it's
just completely absurd
i mean the whole movie was absurd to me
it was
weird especially after re-watching the
other ones because those
uh we were talking about this off-camera
but i think we both in re-watching have
a greater appreciation for gareth
edwards godzilla
yes yes um it has some trite family
drama stuff that most of these movies
suffer from
the boring characters but it felt so
like grounded and real as far as like
the way godzilla is integrated into his
environments
and the way it's shot with the uh it's
all like very
kind of like ground level shots looking
up
and you get a real great sense of scope
of godzilla
and they're using tanks and they're
using real world weapons and
real world attempts to take control of
the situation
and then in this movie they're flying
around in little magical spaceships to
the center of the earth
vehicles uh yeah this one uh
jump i don't know jump the shark i don't
know but i but i think i liked it
see i i have like i'm like like a
post-traumatic monster movie right now
because
i i don't know you re-watched them all
so did i
over the span of maybe 48 hours um
where not i think i was numb watching
this
fourth one so it probably wasn't a good
thing to do that
i mean i went back to kind of like
revisit and i never seen kong skull
island before so that was new
but i seen the other two and so
i i think i was just like uh um
but even with that i still i think i
like this one the best
um it may be tied for the 2014
godzilla they're so different they're
all very even though they're in the same
universe they're all very different but
they're all very the same
and that's the thing is like this one
felt a little more
like crazy and bizarre yeah which i know
the original like i'm not
an expert on the godzilla movies or
anything but you compare like the
original
50s godzilla to some of the later
sequels with like baby godzilla
oh i also watched king kong versus
godzilla from the 50s
and that movie is pretty ridiculous
those movies do get absurd and this
movie is i guess kind of following in
that tradition
where it's like we're just going to try
a bunch of goofy [ __ ]
yeah i mean it is what it is they they
very very wisely
cut down on the
human drama stuff in this the human
characters in this movie are almost like
utilitarian
they're just there to get the monsters
fighting
there's no dumb like estranged father
bullshits
uh you could still cut out millie bobby
brown and her old [ __ ] sub blood
that was uh i think the least
interesting
that's like whenever she shows up on
camera just start like checking your
email or something
until you hear godzilla roar again and
the conspiratorial podcaster guy
yeah i got just got michael bay vibes
you know yeah a little bit like that it
doesn't get that like the dialogue isn't
that annoying or comical but it's in
that vein yeah
and then just this the over abundance
and over fantastical
science fictiony stuff in this it's just
you know
out of control and you can explain it
away
since the titans appeared mankind really
stepped things up and uh started it does
take you out of it though
after especially after watching the
other ones where they feel
mostly real world right and now all of a
sudden we've gone like full
schlock sci-fi
the plot is king kong
is on kong skull island
under a holographic dome to simulate
kong skull island so that he's protected
so that godzilla doesn't come and find
him
because they know godzilla has i guess
gone around and just killed all the
other titans
slapping off camera between movies yeah
it's like
newton hicks and alien three sure
they're all gone they're all gone he
just killed them all
even mothra who saved him in the
godzilla king of monsters but anyways uh
so that's the premise is that they're
hiding kong
and then billionaire tech guru
guy uh the you know your elon musk
ish kind of guy bad man
bad businessman businessman
um is is
developing a mechagodzilla
secretly in his tech lab
and um they keep testing it because he
one wants to make tons of money and then
he also i think it's more of a primal
urge to make men kind of
want to be alphas yeah the planet again
and i'm tech businessman i'm bad guy and
uh but their mechagodzillas only have 40
power
uh it needs the fabled element
that exists in the hollow earth which
everyone thinks is a theory so alexander
skarsgard is a
crackpot uh college professor
who wrote a book about the hollow earth
theory which goes all the way back to
hollow earth comes up in i think it
comes up in all the movies
but it's all theoretical it's called the
hollow earth theory
that there are these massive underground
spaces
isolated from the surface world the
vortex was a tunnel into the hollow
earth it's a subterranean
tunnel system that connects the entire
planet doesn't matter but but the hollow
earth you go through like a spatial
rift vortex that shoots you at light
speed yes
into the center of the earth that's why
you got to go in your little tron
vehicle the tron vehicle can withstand
the pressures
of the gravity pressure of earth they
hope no one's ever done it before but i
guess they're just
taking a shot yes so
um so tech billionaire asks
alexander skarsgard and then alexander
skarsgard says
i guess that maybe in the titans dna
they all kind of know where the hollow
earth is
because like like homing pigeons
or like uh fish swimming upstream they
all
you subconsciously know where to go back
to where they were born
wrote out there sure and they're like
let's go with that
sure let's drop king kong in antarctica
and hope that he knows how to get
back to the center of the earth um
because if kong goes down there
um he might find magical crystals
space rocks that are anti-gravity that
contain massive amounts of energy
in order for us to power up our mecca
godzilla it's some maximum power
that's so that's the tech billionaire
guy's angle and he sends his
his poor daughter down there on this
suicide mission
uh instead of going himself he sends his
daughter she's incognito
secretly working for uh whatever that
company's called
uh dion flux or apex apex
i had all the letters
anyways and so alexander skarsgard goes
to lady uh rebecca hall rebecca hall
whatever her character name is
yeah it's a lady a lady with daughter
and is and she's the the kong whisperer
she's the lady who
who she's the uh diane fosse character
she looks over king kong
but little does she know her adopted
tribal daughter
from the original uh uh people
that lived on skull island were all
wiped out when the storm came
she's the only survivor uh don't cut all
this i know you're thinking about it
you always think he's always thinking
that he's cutting all this
i see the gears working no i'm just as
you were saying that i was thinking
about the fact that like that's another
thing that i guess that happens
in between movies it happened in between
i mean i know skull island took place in
the 70s or whatever somewhere between
1973
and 2021 yeah this storm which is
perpetually
circulating around skull island somehow
like moved and just killed everybody and
then moved back i don't know
uh he asked for buckahol and he says
listen
i think kong will lead us down to the
center of the earth
because kong has realized he threw a
tree up and broke the dome
it's like a truman show dome yeah and
he's like we see at one point we see
he's broken in several spots
which made me wonder why he didn't just
smash the whole [ __ ] thing down he
could have gone up to the wall of it
yeah and started pounding on it but
maybe he's just like
i know what you're doing but i'm okay
with it but eventually they
they're realizing their little in uh
captivity dome
is not going to last for very long yeah
so i think he says like
kong will be safe in the center of the
earth let's take him down there also i
want to find out if the hollow earth is
real
my brother died his brother died trying
to find the hollow earth that gives him
personal motivation
oh because his brother i guess such an
important piece of information i
completely forgot about he looked at a
photograph
that's when i cried he looked at a
photograph of a character we've never
seen before
oh this is everything is like this
happens and then this happens
there's a motivation get through it he
looked at a photograph of his brother
who went down in probably
some kind of conventional undersea craft
and then got smashed
not a tron ship not a tronship from the
tech billionaire guy who has futuristic
awesome technology that's amazing yes um
so he says let's take king kong and
he's going to lead us down the the
center of the earth the
the tech guy's daughter is secretly
there to find the magic crystals
that will power the mechagodzilla so
they're on this special mission
therein lies the setup of our plot it's
just
it's funny because the on the on the
whim
of a tech billionaire just asking a
crackpot
professor on a vague
theory
and asking a favor of rebecca hall
can we take kong
that precipitated this gigantic
operation
where no one else had any input on
whether or not it should happen
the us navy lent 55 of their giant naval
vessels
which all got destroyed and then just
letting kong loose yeah i mean this this
should have been
debated before congress for like months
before it happened
so that's what would have happened in
shin godzilla that whole movie is people
sitting in boardrooms discussing what to
do
yeah this this movie doesn't give a [ __ ]
which as i said
like it was written by a child that's a
good thing and a bad thing um
uh there's the one part of me that wants
a slightly more interesting plot
even though it is kong versus godzilla
but then there's the other one
other part of me that appreciates that
they were just like [ __ ] it
they they embrace the the the absurdity
of it all
yeah there's it is like a child in his
bathtub
like playing with a godzilla in king
kong toys there's that shot yeah
although that
that first big fight between kong and
godzilla on the
the uh on the aircraft carriers where we
see kong like look down
and he sees one two three and he's like
planning out his path of destruction
great set piece great it is oh yeah when
they are fighting when there's monster
stuff happening the movie is a lot of
fun
and uh visually creative the whole hong
kong fight at night with all the neon
like that's one of those things or it's
like this is directed by adam wingard
and you know this is the classic case of
you take an indie director and you give
them a giant movie
because you can control them basically
well he shoots 11 scenes with people on
small sets and then
an army of cgi artists that's that's the
case too but
previous people and shot scene
coordinators and everybody
oh [ __ ] everything else but the idea
like having all that neon
like that it feels that there is some
sort of connective tissue to something
like the guest like a much smaller movie
i think that is the biggest stretch of
logic
i've ever heard not at all i see no
connective tissue
between this aesthetically neon brightly
colored garish neon lights
the score uh is a combination of like
orchestral and kind of uh
electronic stuff uh okay so we got
we got four four godzilla movies
but gareth edwards re-watching godzilla
uh
it kind of had like that rogue one-ish
look
it kind of there was certain shots and
the color tones and stuff like
i felt like maybe a slight
vague fingerprint of gareth edwards
i haven't seen kings of summer or
anything else by
jordan jordan roberts
michael doherty of course i've seen
krampus one of
the best films ever made a film that
should have won an academy award for its
sound design
answered this film sure why not
um i don't know what what did he do uh
he did trick or treat
oh right yeah but and then this
uh adam wingard the only other film i've
seen of his is the guest
and you're next and blair witch oh yeah
you're next yeah yeah yeah you're next
of course um
and blair witch i don't remember
anything about it but um
i don't think adam wingard remembers
anything no i i don't see
i don't see any particular director
like a thumb print well it's hard to say
with kong skull island because i haven't
seen the other movie he did but watching
that movie i i had like
sam raimi flashbacks yeah kind of like
just embracing the absurdity of it all
for a little bit you mentioned that
before i watched it and and
certainly the opening shot yeah when uh
young john goodman's falling from the
sky it's exactly the same opening as
arming of darkness
oh yeah um and i'm not thinking about
like specific shots or anything just the
general tone of it oh yeah but there's a
couple of like
snap zooms and kind of like um funny
moments
uh visually funny kind of creative
moments i i like i think i don't know
maybe skull kong
island whatever these movies are called
maybe that was my favorite
um i think king of monsters was my least
favorite king of the monsters in
re-watching it yeah
because it has the the tired family
drama stuff and it also
this movie wisely when the big fights
are going on
it rarely cuts away to the boring human
[ __ ] it lets them fight for long periods
of time because that's what you want to
see
and it's fun uh correct and king of the
monsters they're cutting to
the vera farmiga and the
early edition guy and all their boring
[ __ ] nobody cares about it that gets
that gets
way too bogged down in that and then it
becomes way too like
ridiculous the the orca machine
and then millie willy milly bobby brown
whatever her name is she grabs uh she
grabs the orca machine
and and runs into fenway park and plugs
it into the sound booth and
uh figures out how to work it and and it
just becomes this like convoluted mess
and i get like a headache and pretty
much every monster fight is
is uh marred by
snow or rain and shaky cam and it's all
like
murky and hard to follow yeah um
skull island and this movie both or
everything's just like completely clear
absolutely we hold on these wide shots
you can see what's happening
fights in the daytime and i think that
was something after
uh king of the monsters came out it
didn't do great it got like
box office and and the reviews are
complaining about that like everything's
at night in the rain or the snow
and it's visually ugly and you can't
follow what's happening very well
and i think uh they actually pushed back
godzilla versus kong to like correct
that i know they pushed it back because
king of the monsters didn't do great i
noticed that like
in hong kong it just suddenly becomes
day
that's fine the sun came up yeah hong
kong got knocked down
it's a passage of time that's okay they
were sleeping there for a little while
it's it's a nice way to break up the
fighting the cool nighttime hong kong
stuff
yeah yeah yeah you want that night
aesthetic but you don't want you know
the whole thing
you certainly don't want the matthew
broderick godzilla
kind of oh god aesthetic yeah sure
but that's the mask bad cg yeah
some interesting notes though not
related to
godzilla directed by the
gareth edwards who did the star wars
it has elizabeth olsen in it
and also aaron taylor johnson
aka the kick-ass guy who i did not know
at this
when i watched this uh re-watched it
until like the end of the movie
i realized he was uh pietro maximoff
aka quicksilver so him and elizabeth
olsen
they play husband and wife in this and
then they play brother and sister like
the
same [ __ ] year in a marvel movie was
age of ultron the same year i think so
okay uh 2014 they i think they just
walked off this set and they just
crossed the little alleyway and walked
into a different sound stage and just
kind of
kept filming some guy came by and
sprayed his hair you know
gave him a different hairstyle and they
just changed the costumes
at least they didn't forget which set
they were on at any point and on the
side of age of ultron they just started
like making out or something
that would have been that would have
been weird yeah yeah wrong movie
anyways um and then uh kong skull island
also is a like a marvel marvel cast
reunion
brie larson yeah tom hiddleston aka loki
and samuel l jackson then for a long
time
i'm watching it and there's that one guy
who's a scientist man
the actor's name is clark gregg
and the whole time i watched the film i
thought it was mark evan jackson
who is the the shield guy
clark gregg is is not that guy
here's two pictures of the two guys they
look very similar so i was very confused
sure and i thought there were four
marvel actors
in kong skull island and then i looked
it up and i'm glad i looked it up
because i don't want to be racist saying
all these white guys look away
okay because they do
i should have got the guy from the guest
to play alexander skarsgard's character
sure i was actually thinking about that
at one point and i also noticed in the
opening credits of this that
uh lance reddick is in it and i was like
oh lance redick he was in the guests
no you know anna wingard's doing this
big movies bringing some of his guest
cast back
and i think lance redick he's in the
opening credits of the movie and he has
like
one line this is the day we feed
i've given the order doctor
i think i really like that kong skull
island
you know what that movie i mean that
movie's about kong i love
king kong in general i'm not a big
godzilla fan
uh but the smartest thing this movie did
was make king kong the protagonist of
the film
yeah not some boring ass human character
this is this is king kong's movie
yeah yeah yeah he opens it and closes it
it starts with him taking a nap i'm
waking up from a nap
yeah he's definitely our hero and
godzilla
is definitely sort of the antagonist and
he's portrayed
more menacing and evil than the other
films where
he kind of looks cute yeah this he looks
really kind of nasty
well they gotta get around by this point
he's they say he's like the our
protector he protects us from other
titans they call him the monsters and so
you kind of got to get around that
and it's like uh we got to have him one
of them has to be a villain yeah one of
them has to be sort of
so now he's turning on us and we don't
know why and it turns out it's because
of
he recognizes the power that's
controlling the
mechagodzilla well here's where things
get
weird uh in the post-credits scene
of godzilla king of the monsters charles
dance
uh who does not appear in this film i
was wondering about that
maybe he just died or something either
the character or charles dance
i don't know but he he uh he preserved
one of the heads of godura which has
been proven to
re respawn itself or
to you know it grew at head back because
it's an alien
right uh and so charles dance has
preserved its head
and so that does carry over into this um
he must have sold it
to elon musk and again another thing i
guess that happened off camera at some
point then they connect
its brain or its skull
yeah not even his brain it's skull you
think it's hollowed out
skull yeah it should have been like a
floating dragon head in a jar
that was alive something more biological
yeah because that was the
idea of it right they said like that
that that's really what was controlling
it or the
the guy it's got a bunch of more neon we
got a bunch of neon tubes coming out of
the skull
of a giant dinosaur skull and this guy
sitting in the middle of it with like
a vr headset on controlling
mechagodzilla uh
i thought it would be like connected to
the brain of someone
someone was laughing while they were
writing all this stuff it should have
been a big
big dragon brain in a jar i mean that
just would have been beautiful
it was the school was interestingly
funny yeah but like
yeah i had this like floating and still
alive yeah that would have been fun
yeah like looking around and that's
really what ends up like then the guy
who's controlling it goes ah
and his head melts and you know his head
blows up or something and then
then the the the dragon head is really
controlling the mechagodzilla
because i think that's what godzilla is
attracted to that's why they have to
shoot around the earth to do their their
test
runs yeah with the skull
crushers yes from skull island yes
they're like uh they just use them as
like bait to to practice
the the mechagodzilla on uh and then
godzilla's like
what's that and i'm gonna come get you
and then you shoot around and shhh
what what else
these are dangerous times
they did show kong climbing up the
building as a cute little reference
within the building fellow the building
immediately collapses it's pretty funny
because
that's the same problem they ran into is
the the old king kong versus godzilla is
that
kong in the original uh movie
he climbs the empire state building
that's the most famous image for the
movie
but godzilla is larger than the empire
state building so how do you have them
fight
i guess he's just bigger now that's what
they said in kong skull island
is they say he's still growing or
something like that he's younger then
and now he's got a little gray he's a
little bigger
so i think yeah which is fine for this
because this is a reset this is a new
series of movies yeah that's fine that's
fine it doesn't matter
uh the the most iconic image is kong
holding
the lady and that is repeated in all the
kong films
they had a remake in the 70s where he
climbs up the world trade center right
with jeff bridges
yeah and um and that's the iconic images
kung
holding the blond-haired lady climbing
the empire state building and
helicopters trying to
shoot at him yeah and they they have a
little little tiny nod to that in
kong skull island when he picks up brie
larson remember
he a kong loves the lady he's like a
lady
and he and he feels protective of the
lady yeah that's the kong
thing um but then he picks up brie
larson
and then then a battle happens remember
and he's holding her and there's
he's fighting like a dinosaur and i'm
like don't drop brie larson
or she's gonna call you sexist
aaron taylor johnson was a bomb expert
yes that was his thing he's the only one
that could do the job at the end of that
film
then brian cranston dies i guess that
was supposed to be a bit of a subversion
like uh janet lee dying early in psycho
because that whole movie was promoted on
brian cranston being in it and then they
kill him off so early on
and then you're stuck with boring-ass
kick-ass guy
yeah that's again this movie they're not
too concerned with the human characters
to the point where all the main human
villains
just get dispatched like they're nothing
can we come up with a name that i
noticed uh like a
like yeah whatever that guy the tech guy
what's his name i don't know who is his
character's name i don't know
you remember charles foster kane edu
from citizen kane you remember that
character's name why don't you remember
the tech billionaire's name
from godzilla vs kong oh because one's
an interesting character
and one is the guy that made mecha
godzilla
i mean that's the first thing that i
think of off the top of my head
what i want to do is make a
mechagodzilla
you you run a newspaper mr cain and we
don't have that kind of technology yet
trying to er co-mingle
the citizen kane verse with the monster
verse
sure yeah
uh
arsene wells really cut his hand in that
scene is that true
when he broke the beer and he kept going
i heard in this movie at one point
godzilla cut his hand while
toppling over a building and he he kept
going and a bunch of computer
programmers fell out
my job 50 hours a week is to animate
the lighting on his fingernails
thank god i'm dying
a sweet release of time
i was in charge of the water droplets
flying
through the air that's something fun you
can do as an audience member is when you
get to the end of one of these types of
movies and you get the
we've joked about the the wall of names
that just goes on and on
just think about how every one of those
people wishes they were dead
they were it's like a virtual it's like
a virtual sweatshop
oh [ __ ]
oh yeah i wanted to mention the the
moment the tech guy
i'm just going to keep calling him the
tech guy when he dies he there's that
all this noise and then that moment when
someone realizes
that they're about to die and the
soundtrack drops out and they go
oh [ __ ] bring that all back up
what what is the name of that trope is
there a trope can i create
it the only time other time i could
think about it is
it independence day
yeah no i know the trope you're talking
about yeah i can't think of any other
specifics but i can see them in my brain
yeah yeah there's that moment when
and then the like oh yeah
it's like a comedy moment and then
so-and-so
gets killed by something yeah yeah what
should we call it
the harvey fire scene that can be his
legacy
the fire a firesteen event yeah the
firesteen event
there's a firesteen event in this one
i also thought of a different trope the
the ono what's next look
i thought of that kong skull island
one that you hear like
weird sounds coming and all the
characters turn and the camera
is on them they go
i'm gonna do it okay ready
i i guess it shouldn't be so um
like oh no it has to be more fearful
yeah okay i'm trying to do it more
fearful
okay
wait here we go and just can you add a
soundtrack a sound effect i'll add a
dramatic stick look at like a
you just use like a lion roar yeah or
like a dinosaur sound effect okay
i'm walking along through the jungle
right here it is ready okay
can you do the sound effect though so i
have a q oh oh sure here we go
can we do another take okay
um i think watching all these monster
movies has ruined your brain you know
what's funny is i was watching a
completely different
program a show this is real this is true
story this is a true story i was
watching completely different shows like
a drama
show that i'm watching i won't say what
because it's terrible
and there were characters talking and
then there was like a scene transition
sound effect and it was like
like a bus or something and it cut you
know like like an outcut with some
comes in from the next scene yeah and
and um
and then i thought oh no like it's a
monster
like another monster set piece sequence
is about to start
and it was like in my head and then i
thought oh
yeah that's not gonna happen in this
thing that i'm watching it's just i
thought
like if oh no here we come here comes
the godzilla scene you know
but yeah i think that would have been
pretty shocking if it did it could have
been
it wouldn't have made sense yeah but if
a godzilla showed up
kong bows to no one
but uh would you recommend king of king
of skull island
i i would yeah it's it's one of those
ones like it's like it's incredibly
stupid but not in an annoying way
it's in a like we're just having fun
here kind of way
like this is all goofy nonsense and it's
fine
the fights are are actually fun to watch
it is good to not take your movie about
giant monsters
too seriously or try to make it too
dramatic with
your human character with the boring
family drama yeah
the estranged father nope get that out
of here
millie probably brown's going to the one
place she knows best
home
he's gonna be safe there yeah they
always managed to find each other too
oh yeah at the end of this i laughed out
loud
kyle chandler oh yeah it goes to
uh destroyed hong kong he didn't even
know his daughter was there she tried
calling him at one point and their phone
call got broken up yeah i think it may
have gotten through
maybe it seemed like she he she didn't
even get that part of it
um but sorry he gets there in like
five minutes somehow yeah maybe he got
in one of those pneumatic tubes
he must have did you have to book a
commercial flight
does it take him like 14 hours to get
there
i don't know how i mean military jet
monarch secret monarch uh
supersonic jet right it's all fine they
had that big supersonic jet in godzilla
king of the monsters remember and he's
gotta take a taxi
from the airport or wherever they landed
to the city center
whatever that may be now i mean it's
just
rubble everywhere and the taxi guy's
like this is as far as i could take you
there's no roads you're going to have to
climb over a mount everest
sized pile of debris smoking
toxic debris to get to a small crowd of
extras
of 35 extras and then go
milly milly dad dad and then find each
other
in this gigantic area of
destruction
these movies are ridiculous but why
don't i hate them
i don't hate them i i like them they
they don't push the
obnoxious comedy relief we always bring
up michael bay
yeah they're not as dumb as michael bay
movies
they kind of embrace the silliness of it
more so as they go along
yeah they take themselves just seriously
enough
to give you that monster action yeah and
like it's one of those kind of they're
they're kinds of movies where they get a
pass
you know what i mean i don't know i
guess you could say the same thing about
a transformers movie
you people want to watch these giant
robots fight what's the problem you know
and and i don't know it's like a blurry
line
it just appears yeah just the matter of
taste
do you enjoy this i i personally don't
really
i was never a huge godzilla person or
king kong guy
i just don't care and i watch these and
i'm like okay
the one moment that sucked though when
khan gets back up in the city
and his arm is like dislocated and he
pops it back into socket
he's just a big monkey why would he
think to do that that's true but
um that's your biggest complaint that's
my biggest complaint
so want to watch dick shark
i'll i'll watch my copy and you watch
your copy all right
it seems kind of like a private thing
yeah
oh we don't have a dvd playerermedia/posts/10158226607502634
