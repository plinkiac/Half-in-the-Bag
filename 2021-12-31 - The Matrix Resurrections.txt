["Half in the Bag!"]

["This seems like a cash grab."]

Mike:
Hey, nostalgia fans! Neo and Trinity are back in Joe Dante's Matrix: Resurrections. It's been about 20 years since the original Matrix film changed the landscape of movies forever, by inspiring millions of frat guys to attempt to make the same movie because they had a video camera, a pair of sunglasses, and some plastic guns. Then they made two sequels. Now Hollywood says, "What else we got?" And shazam! It's a new Matrix movie. But it's not exactly what you'd expect it to be. Now sit back, plug in, and listen to two barely literate midwestern drunks talk about this movie that you won't remember in two weeks.
{"I remember this."]

Mike:
It's The Matrix: Resurrections.

Jay:
It's a shame the second movie was called Reloaded. That seems like a good title for a reboot.

Mike:
That's terrific
a much later reboot i mean i guess you
could just call it reboot
matrix rebooted because that's got
computer terminology in it that actually
would have been a really appropriate
that would have been better i know that
would fit with the
the theme yeah uh the very meta one of
the 15 themes
one of the very meta themes in this uh
which is
heavily acknowledged throughout the film
but you made the matrix even i've heard
that
yeah
we kept some kids entertained
so worth it
well throughout the first act i mean it
kind of comes back at the end i guess
we'll get into it but yeah well let's
just say
uh if you haven't watched this we're
just going to have spoilers throughout
because now for a couple weeks it's been
out for a while by the time you've
already saw it and gotten angry about it
and said it's the worst movie ever not
everybody said that well i i saw before
i saw the movie i saw like an article
headline or tweet or something that
compared it favorably to the last jedi
and i was like oh i know exactly what
that means that means that it's going to
be
it's going to get more praise than it
deserves from some people and it's going
to be bashed more than it deserves by
some people
and the truth lies somewhere in the
middle and i think that's the case with
this movie well the the middling
reviews the 68
and it's like 70 but you know you go
through the comments throughout tomatoes
one star livestock ones
but let me say
this movie was a mess
what a mess
uh it was confusing
it was cringy at times
it was annoying
total effort milf
it was sloppy
uh terrible
and i loved every minute of it
there was something magical going on
here and i i i've only watched it once
i had to take a break because it was
getting late at night and i was like i'm
too tired this movie was too long i
guess in the morning 7 30 or so it was 7
30 and then yeah dinner i had my dinner
and a wheel of fortune was over and i
was like yeah i can't finish the the
next hour so i did watch it the next
morning but that'd probably be
beneficial to watch it in two parts
because i was really on board for the
first act
and then once the literal story started
because there's a lot of things going on
like thematically and
i want to say subtextually but although
some of it's not very subtle but the
literal story is i think what people
that don't like the movie are latching
onto
because it's very simplistic
we have to rescue trinity
and like if that's all you're getting
out of it i can see being bored by it
and the action sucks
[Music]
and so it's like you want a sequel to
the matrix just like story-wise or
exploring the lore and the world of the
matrix i can understand being completely
disappointed and once the meta stuff in
the first act or so kind of dissipates
and it becomes the we have to save
trinity story it gets kind of boring i
say i am the complete opposite oh
uh surprisingly enough it's on the nose
in terms of it being
uh
cheeky and self-aware
and meta right the the video game people
on point people want us up in their gray
space switching their synaptic wtf light
on their their brainstorming session you
know it's like very clearly like a
parody of hollywood executives well in
audiences and audiences yeah and in fact
i was like i was like already like i
just worked i had this ready for like
weeks months i'm like you know what
when i do my half in the bag on this
i'm calling it matrix regurgitations
that'll show them and then they
they said it and i was like wait a
minute you're one step ahead of me this
isn't this isn't like
and that's the difference between
uh what i was expecting and what
happened i i was kind of thinking it
would be
[Music]
you know an annoying reboot
attempt to restart the franchise and i
wasn't expecting all the
almost self-deprecating almost
definitely self-aware oh yeah he's kind
of worried at first because he's so much
older the beard the hair oh
it all totally works for me you idiot
well as you mentioned joe dante that
there's an element of gremlins too that
was my joe dante joke i was criticizing
not just the
reaction to the original movies but the
uh the fan base and the movies
themselves i mean it's right the movie
is almost critic proof because anything
you want to throw at it it's like
they've already thought of it
yeah not just the original movies but
what the reaction to this movie will
probably be
i wasn't too sure about the call back
but you know just hard to resist what
which kind of makes me respect it or
it's like it's just one of the
wachowskis one of them didn't want to do
it so i guess it's just lana wachowski
but having that just kind of [ __ ] it
attitude as the character says in the
movie like they're going to do this with
or without you
they informed me they're going to do it
with or without us i thought they
couldn't do that
oh they can
and they made it clear they'll kill our
contract if we don't cooperate
really
so it's like okay well i'm gonna do it
i'm gonna i'm gonna make a a reboot a
remake
a a nostalgia driven cash grab this
seems like a cash grab
i'm going to do all these things and i'm
going to make it i guess a love story
[ __ ] it the matrix is a love story now
our characters died in the original
trilogy but they're gonna make another
one so [ __ ] it they're just back and now
we have a happy ending it was a love
story it reminded me of in again with
gremlins too there's the overhead uh
speaker system that's like tonight on
the clamp movie network casablanca with
a happier ending a second of that
yeah and um and i admire that go for
broke attitude of just like they're
gonna do it regardless let's let's kind
of uh do something that's more
commenting on not just those movies but
the recent trend of
nostalgia-driven reboots yes
things have changed the market's tough
i'm sure you can understand why our
beloved parent company warner brothers
has decided to make a sequel to the
trilogy one it's the anti-ghostbusters
afterlife yeah it's the exact and it's
funny because i've seen reactions to
this where people are like remember the
matrix remember and it's like no it's
not that it's not that
uh and it's almost like they're winking
literally winking at the camera like i
think my favorite performance in the
movie was from um
uh neil patrick harris
not the architect he's the analyst yeah
which is not he
was he the new architect or was he just
a lower i when it comes to the lore of
any of these movies i don't [ __ ] know
that's the thing i didn't know what was
going on the whole time
um but i i kind of knew what was going
on and so i was like well what's going
on literally isn't as important as what
the movie's really about and that's kind
of the fun part about it you can ignore
some of that but it
it is it is the new gremlins 2
because it finds that balance
joe dante and
and lana wachowski probably had a nice
dinner together one night
isn't this wonderful
we're finally getting to know each other
and joe said here's what you do
they came to you they're gonna do it
did lana want to do this or was it was
like uh warner brothers like here you've
talking you with a stick you want some
money why why now what why is why is now
the right time for more matrix
whoa um
oh i'm assuming it's similar to what
they say in the movie which is they're
gonna do it with or without you and so
it's like well okay yeah that's
reference i would rather see this than
someone else take over and just do a
boring
traditional give you everything give the
audience everything they think they want
sequel right which is something else
this movie common song we don't want
another uh joel kinnaman robocop
oh yeah or total recall with uh
that irish man oh yeah colin
colin farrell we don't want that as
confusing as the movie is on its own it
would be incomprehensible to anyone
unfamiliar with the original movie oh
yeah
i didn't like the uh occasionally they
do the not occasionally they do it a lot
but the quick cut kind of flashbacks to
the original movie i thought those were
tacky
um but again maybe that was a joke
like shoving in the remember when stuff
i don't know
it didn't really work for me but
again
i think it was intentional so there's
nothing wrong with that
it's what artists do
[Music]
oh
no
no no no no whoa what do you mean no
you wanted this you did this this was
your idea
hell yes
well you got to look at this from the
studio perspective they want to make a
movie that the audience doesn't have to
watch the originals
that's the point of a soft reboot in the
second and third if you if you remember
yeah this is mainly i mean there are
aspects of the second and third one in
this but it's mainly a
remember the matrix remember the first
movie kind of thing the second one is
sort of glossed over with the exception
of the appearance of the mirror
vengeance and
some of the werewolves that show up and
the uh the jada pinkett's character yeah
jada pinkett's character although she
bleeds over to the third one but really
it's like the first one
uh neo as the computer programmer
everyday man who gets swept up into the
matrix and then the very ending of the
third one the conclusion of the whole
trilogy when
neo
sacrifices himself
uh as a as a peace offering a truce
there's some sort of jesus [ __ ] going on
yeah he he made his trinity gets impaled
by a piece of rebar
and dies
and then uh since he he's blinded
so
uh there's some sort of metaphorical
reference there i'm sure that's the
thing is like those second and third
films are just like
every kind of every kind of
um uh literary
biblical reference we could
philosophical philosophical every
everything that's that smartypants that
you don't understand we're gonna jam in
here and if you don't get it it's your
fault
um we're not going to tell you anything
we're going to make references to
to [ __ ]
plato and uh we're not going to tell you
anything and yet also inexplicably we're
never going to stop talking yeah yeah
yeah those movies get so bogged down in
dialogue and so if you don't understand
you're stupid
don't even try to analyze the matrix
films because you didn't understand it
neither did i but you didn't understand
it
so you're not smart they're smarter than
you
but uh the ending yes he he says uh i
give up myself i am the neo i am the
anomaly that the the the system
can't function
with an anomaly as strong as neo so if i
if i give myself up as an anomaly you
will let the people in zion live and i
think that's what happened in the end of
the third one i haven't seen it in
15 years whatever i saw it once
just once i think i've seen it twice but
it's still even that's been a long time
definitely the second one a bunch of
times oh because
i like the second one a lot it was it
was a cascading like fail series of
failures for me the second one the first
one is is is genius it's what we always
say lightning in the bottle it's it's
yeah um it's perfect
neo flying up at the end you're like
okay i got it i don't need any more it's
a perfect little movie yeah and um there
would have been millions of ways to make
really good sequels to that i think but
well it became a thing and again this
new movie kind of comments on it but the
original matrix kind of meant different
things to different people like for me
it was always just a really well done
action movie with kind of a clever
conceit
that touches on these kind of
philosophical ideas of like what is
reality but it's just under the surface
and the sequels
someone told them like the philosophy
stuff you should focus more on that or
they thought that was what what people
wanted out of a sequel so they they
amped all that stuff up and and kind of
alienated people that just wanted a cool
action movie
uh yeah
you say a good conceit i say a genius
concern well sure whatever but it's a
solid movie that
for me was a good action movie other
people that maybe latched on to the
the style of it the the action scenes
just on their own other people like the
we live in a simulation kind of oh yeah
mind [ __ ] it hit all the notes
in in 1999 the matrix was the new star
wars for
a new generation
ironically there was a new star wars
for a new generation but at the same
time but the matrix was that
now
it and and to me it was the culmination
it was it was the the apex
of
the 90s
the 90s was
a period of time where movies stumbled
their way
through the
virtual
and cyber films oh starting back in
lawnmower man
sandra bollix the net oh yeah where she
orders a pizza on the internet do you do
you remember
virtuosity
well hackers i think that was a little
earlier but um
yeah they were they were like okay
internet internet is new
virtual reality uh cyber
uh no one really quite knew what to do
so they stumbled through about like 10
films and then the wachowskis come along
bam yeah they know exactly what to do
with with this new stuff and not just
those aspects of it but also the the
technologies of filmmaking yes the
bullet time of course is a big deal um
and
and and then the whole like uh it wasn't
just like
we've gotta we've gotta punch people
there there was there was the
uh genius little pair uh parallel with
the alice in wonderland storyline i mean
it was like it was like a fairy tale
much like the original star wars sure uh
uh uh neo is the everyday and i think i
reference it in my mr plinkett phantom
menace review as neo is the perfect
protagonist because he is the everyday
man
who
is given the allison wonderland uh pill
yeah you know you go down the rabbit
hole and to a fantastical world where
you meet the the cheshire cat and the
rabbit with the i got them running out
of time the clocks clocks with the
rabbit and you know it's it's like it's
the lewis carroll's uh uh
alice in wonderland just in a digital
age the world you live in is not what
you what it appears to be and it's so
exciting yeah as i say those aspects
with like groundbreaking action and
also the soundtrack of course was a huge
deal so it's like everything those are
those are that's the that's the it's the
icing
the the heart is is neo is you
and you're going through it with neo and
neo is he wakes up and what
the world isn't real i'm in a pod of goo
aliens have have taken it's it's 300
years in the future and i was living in
the 90s
and it's
2372 and and and there's robots that are
using human beings as batteries and like
it's like a nightmare but then he
adjusts and there's the training
sequences when morpheus you know plugs
him in to the matrix and he's like
morpheus says do you think that's air
you're breathing
and and
you know like you're like what
oh my god he's in a simulation what if
there's a whole world out there that
we're not aware of yes and and it's it's
everything we know is a lie
the crux of it is choice that is whether
or not
you have a free choice or if
everything's planned out for you it's
it's uh
destiny versus um free will
everything begins with choice no
wrong and uh and and so there's big
thematic elements they don't they don't
go overboard that's that's the thing
about that first movie it's the perfect
balance of all these where they start
bringing in like they start dusting off
philosophy books from
from ancient times and saying you didn't
you didn't get that
that reference from nietzsche
what are you stupid
when that stuff starts coming in
if there's an answer
there's only one place you're going to
find it where
you know where
but when it's when it's accessible yeah
to the everyday audience and then
there's there's the danger of of the
agents and you can be killed in the real
world while you're plugged in in a chair
and all those like that that that
complete relatability yeah and then it
ends with neo
arcing discovering he is the one and he
has the ability to to
bend the matrix with his arms and stop
bullets
and then that's the end of the film and
he goes off to adventure and who knows
what awaits
well the matrix reloaded is what awaits
i know that's the thing is those sequels
and
even though i don't like the sequels i
admire what they were trying to do with
them because yeah at the end of the
first movie it's like he's the one
and the sequels are kind of trying to
deconstruct that it's like oh no you're
you're a part of the matrix and we've
rebooted you
seven times or something like that we
keep going through the same thing over
and over star wars luke skywalker
is
neo at the end of a new
hope sentinels
how long five maybe six minutes the
death star will be in range in five
minutes
what is he doing
he's beginning to believe
luke you switched off your targeting
computer what's wrong nothing
i'm all right because he is the one with
the magic power who was able to shoot
the proton torpedo into the hole and
blow up the death star when everyone
else failed oh yeah and then he gets a
[ __ ] gold ribbon
a gold medal on a ribbon so does han
solo chewbacca chewbacca doesn't luckily
they fixed that with rise of skywalker
oh thank you thank god that is vital oh
thank you thank
god is metal oh thank you thank god
were they were they playing with us all
along
because that agent smith fight is almost
like a joke in itself it's like well
there's one agent smith now there's a
hundred
where it's like in retrospect now i want
to go back and re-watch them and see
based on this new movie see if i have a
different reaction to those i have a
feeling they're trying to create like
art or a really
deep complex lore they were yeah that
was the goal and they weren't giving an
audience what it wanted
um which they wanted more cool action
and you know they wanted the same movie
again and they tried to do something
different i don't think it's successful
but like i said i kind of admire the
attempt to do something different even
though i don't really like those sequels
well i think i think too is
they wanted the audience wanted by the
end of the third
one in in typical
movie narrative fashion they wanted
the humans to win in the end
you want the humans to defeat the robots
which is virtually impossible
and the wachowskis look at it from a
perspective of
this is this is just a mind [ __ ]
computer program that resets it they're
more in the technological element
um and then
[Music]
people weren't happy with the ending
because it wasn't it it ends with the
oracle
sitting on a park bench with uh
is it that little girl who shows up in
this new one yes yes looking at the sun
or the rainbow the matrix has reset
itself yeah and then and then there's
that confusing scene this i think this
is where i get very confused when neo
meets the architect
and the second one in the second one
there goes some of my answers you will
understand and some of them you will not
and the architect you know explains
everything and that neo's been there
like 38 times before and they have all
the tvs with all the different neos
and it's like
is neo is
is a human being he's a like literal
human being uh and then how long has
this been going on for and all those
neos like how many times has the matrix
reset
and as a human being has he aged did he
keep getting like put back in the in the
pod and taken back out and like i didn't
understand that
uh and this it it seems to ignore that
part
and kind of jump from matrix one to
resurrections yeah where neo got
put you know after he sacrificed himself
and laying there like jesus with the
eyes gouged out
and uh
they consume him
and then
uh there's some kind of storyline about
how
neo they
uh neil patrick harris resurrects
trinity
he he rebuilds her body so she comes
back alive same with neo they fix his
eyes yes they fix his brain
they get everything back to what you
want
they come back over that's the thing is
like the literal story like i don't know
what the [ __ ] is going on and the
explanation of that stuff
but it almost doesn't matter well he
says i he says that
these neo and trinity are kind of like
the the errant programs that
that mess with the balance of the matrix
and uh
keeping them alive was important but
keeping them subdued and in the matrix
was even more important yeah and they
couldn't be close together because
they're too powerful close together it's
some kind of like
computer thing where it's like they're
through programs that when they're when
they work together they
can cause catastrophic failure to the
matrix so they kept them in pods like
kind of separated and that was like the
best outcome
um and i don't know why he resurrected
them because an audience wants more i i
i don't know if you're talking about the
actual story reason i don't have any
idea well there's some kind of like
like um
the the there's a new version of the
matrix right yeah and um which is kind
of like it's a there's a great little
speech at the end by neil patrick harris
where he's
very clearly talking about what
audiences want and about that last scene
when they confront him that's yeah
that's what
ties the whole movie up in a little bow
yeah
audiences want something familiar
and comfortable that doesn't challenge
them too much he says a bunch of stuff
like that and in regards to the matrix
specifically they don't want this
sentimental crap
go for it
remake it
knock yourselves out but here's the
thing
the sheeple
aren't going anywhere
they like my world
they don't want this
sentimentality they don't want freedom
or empowerment they want to be
controlled
they crave the comfort of certainty
because now it's a love story it's neo
and trinity together
and they're going to make this magical
world with rainbows and [ __ ] he's like
they don't want that
they want the same [ __ ] they've seen a
million times before right they want the
matrix one again it's very cynical it's
very meta
it's that's fine it's schlock
it made me laugh many times but but not
in a way where it was bad i mean the
movie looks cheap
yeah the action fight scenes aren't that
great
blah blah blah
the action's the worst that's the thing
too is like
it's a it's a matrix movie so even if
you're going to do this like meta stuff
like the action should be decent and
none of the i did like the part
when the they call them bots or like
throwing themselves out of windows yeah
oh yeah that was
that was the one fun part but other than
that all the i know they didn't have the
same uh
like like choreography crew that did the
original three movies
um i was surprised i think it's the
highest budget movie of the four
resurrecting you both was crazy
expensive which really surprised me i
would i could forgive the cheapness if
it was like
they did for a lower budget because
they didn't have high expectations for
how well a new matrix movie would do but
it's pretty expensive i want to say it's
like close to 200 million dollars
so it does look cheap for that just
visually
again it's one of those things where
it's like they did
kind of everything right i mean keanu is
he's almost 60 yeah
and he's not going to be fighting like
he was when he was 30
you know which is just a law of nature
and it's and you don't want a bad stunt
double
and carry on moss you know of course is
older as well
but um and so they have a couple of like
trinity does her signature
leg kick
on a couple of punches but then they uh
neo fights but then what he's mostly
doing is like i'm going to stop he does
this so many times he's got force powers
but he can't fly anymore well he's got
he's got to save his energy for those
john wick movies that's where he really
exudes himself
[Laughter]
which by the way another kind of meta
thing
uh in this new version of the matrix
he's the video game designer carrie anne
moss is like a like a wife with two kids
her husband who's named chad which that
alone is funny because chad is like the
alpha
um the actor playing chad was his stunt
double on the original movies keanu
stunt double and the director of the
john wick movies i guess it's like
there's another meta thing because it's
like
in this world she's with him and he's in
reality keanu's stunt double and
that's interesting yeah i thought that
was interesting look i'm sorry i'm a
geek
i hated it at first i was very concerned
at first
with those like cringy
video game guys
oh yeah and and i don't but once you
realize what they're kind of critiquing
then it works yeah it just felt out of
place yeah such a such a very like the
original movies were just so cool
everyone was cool in it and every every
line of dialogue was just so simple and
pointed and
and then this it's like you have those
goofy wacky characters but it's like
they are the personification of of
perhaps lana wachowski's hatred of like
studio executives maybe this is all and
the the college guys that you were
talking about in the opening they're
like bullet time cool right they're the
audience what do what do people want to
see they want to see bullet time yeah
and um like what do we know about the
matrix and and all that kind of stuff
and it's like i'm sure
she's had numerous conversations with
higher-ups who've talked like that oh
yeah and that they even named drop
warner brothers at one point yeah their
parent company warner brothers wants to
make a sequel
and that's why this is a this is a joe
dante film it's it's genius in many ways
but on the opposite end of that they do
find a balance in creating new lore for
the matrix movies that the
real matrix fans might like
maybe that's the stuff i was bored by
when i say the middle of the movie was
boring when they go to uh not zion
whatever the ion or whatever the new
one's called io or something
uh and we have boring scenes with jada
pinketts and i guess it's kind of
interesting the idea that the machines
and the humans are sort of
yeah cohabit coexisting or something i
don't know it was a cutesy little robot
and that feels like a nod to studio
notes like right right right you're
gonna have a cutesy version of something
from the original movie i don't know
when when the robotic winged uh bird
shows up i
i felt like i was watching a episode of
rick and morty
it got so silly and i'm like what is
that
when they had the sentinels come in and
i'm like oh they reprogrammed sentinels
to work for them you know
um
what movie did that oh that was uh rogue
one remember rogue one oh vaguely um
they take uh like a death star droid
yeah played by um
character alan tudyk and they
reprogrammed the work for them yeah and
so it's like that's kind of typical but
but i think they said like the the
the the squids the
the sentinels had had like a change of
heart or something like something wanted
to help the humans which didn't make any
sense i was confused by that but
whatever um but they have some robots
that help them steal neo out of the
poop pod
and they they take them away and that's
the weird thing is the whole plot of the
movie like i said it's we have to rescue
trinity it's like a heist or something
um there's even the scene where they're
all in a circle talking about their plan
it just feels so like
simplistic for what you would think a
matrix sequel would be because the other
ones are so
kind of heady and have these big ideas
i'm talking about a literal level she is
explaining the plan or the the grown-up
indian girl is who's a program yeah
they go inside the matrix
and uh that they talked to the girl the
little indian girl from the subway was
grown up and her parents were purged
and the dad gave her all the knowledge
uh
uh this is probably pointless but the
plan is to get trinity and then perform
some kind of operation where
the girl with the blue hair
could jump in trinity's body temporarily
to
kind of take her take her matrixy place
so that they could pull the real trinity
out and save her in real life
i don't know
i i did read real quick i read one very
brief thing okay and i don't know if
it's real but it was a little like
paragraph by by lana wachowski
so reading lana wachowski's reason for
making the matrix and and tearing up all
over again so i don't know this is a
quote it's just on text
and i i'm assuming it's real if it's not
let us know
email
us at idontgive2fucks
at
matrix.matrix.fart
clown penis dot fart
alana kashowski said my dad died then
this friend died
then my mom died wow
i didn't really know how to process that
kind of grief i hadn't experienced it
that closely you know their lives are
going to end and yet it was still really
hard my brain has always reached into my
imagination and one night i was crying
and couldn't sleep my brain exploded
this whole story
and i couldn't have my mom and dad yet
suddenly i had neo and trinity arguably
the two most important characters in my
life it was immediately comforting to
have these two characters alive again
and it's super simple you can look at it
and say okay these two people die and
okay bring these two people back to life
and doesn't that feel good yeah it did
it's simple and this is what art does
and that's what stories do they comfort
us
okay well that makes the whole movie
make a lot more sense yeah interesting
and um you know we we always go we don't
really
delve too far into like i like i was
curious about how this got made i said
did studios poke lana and go we need
another film uh you're gonna direct it
or else we own the property technically
we're gonna we're gonna get uh
uh uh colin trevorrow colin trevaro or
uh we're gonna get brett ratner and he's
he's gonna make i think he's been me
tood so he's out of the equation okay
well we're gonna get
we're gonna get uh
brian singer okay that's better um and
he's going to make a matrix uh with a
bunch of little boys in it
and they're all going to be the sentinel
the the agents the age of the agents
have gone down to 17.
more agile okay it's like they're more
agile at fighting that's that makes
sense
that's the most logical reason to have
your movie filled with 17 year old boys
they're younger they're sexier and
they're more agile at fighting neo
because they can duck
a little shorter maybe than irregular
agents yeah um
and brian singer is going to direct
or how will we get bill cosby to direct
he's out of prison
temporarily he can direct the new matrix
film sure or james franco
or louis c.k
you know we could have a whole scene
in front of trinity you know and do you
want that
bullet time in bullet time
oh my god i just got the mental image
that will never leave my brain yeah yeah
and i hate that i just brought this into
the world everyone picture trinity in
bullet time dodging something that's not
a bullet
j j did that for you
[Laughter]
i want to take the blue pill
uh it's interesting because it is like
you said reboot would have been a great
title because it is
they are going back to the beginning
it's not like as something as like like
jurassic park like jurassic world where
it's like okay here we go again and why
is everything the same
in the computer programming logic of it
all it makes more sense as a remake or
reboot yeah his reboot is means starting
up your computer again and that is
perfect it's perfect and so when the
program is rebooted
there are all these different little um
visual things like there's the shot
underneath
the helicopter as it's as it's firing a
huge machine gun and all the shells are
raining down there's so many like
uh individual like neo waking up
it's like uh you know it's like calling
back well even the whole opening scene
which is almost identical to the opening
of the original movie right but then
there's and you have our what's her name
bugs or something her watches bugs the
rabbit and she starts to get like
frustrated when things are slightly
different she's like that's not how it's
supposed to be so deja vu and yet it's
obviously overall why use old code to
mirror something new i don't know yet
again it's like that's the audience
give us exactly what we want again we
know what the audience thinks it wants
and we're going to give you the exact
same [ __ ] and that's what this movie is
making fun of yeah yeah yeah i wish they
pushed it further that's my only problem
is the middle of the movie i think is
kind of boring and then uh new morpheus
which i i suppose you could say that's
like a nod to just casting a younger
actor for a reboot like to bring in the
younger audience or something yeah but
he has some line about nostalgia too
when they're in the theater that's
literally projecting the first movie
[Laughter]
nothing comforts anxiety like
little nostalgia and then you get to
those uh
those action scenes the so the a couple
new things they introduce the the swarm
um instead of moving agents around
within people they just activate all the
people in the matrix
they turn into like zombies i think they
they call them bots don't they i think
they say bots at one point they they
either say bots or the swarm they call
them the swarm because their eyes turn
into matrix yeah and they aren't real
people anyways so they are bots they're
digital representations of the people
that live in the coupons
so yeah they're just computer programs
that are linked to human brains so they
take them over which makes complete
sense and
the idea of the
the morpheus character
is sort of an amalgamation of a morph
morpheus and a
agent yeah that neo wrote into the
program for some reason he creates a
module
like a miniature verse
to kind of test to see if the matrix was
real something um and so that guy he's
he's a bunch of like little digital
things that'll kind of coalesce and
create a create a like a person that can
exist in the real world
it's almost like the inverse of a matrix
a real person goes into the matrix a
matrix c character comes into the real
world as
little digital uh magnetic things that
come here yeah it kind of looks like
those
oh the the pin thing yeah put your face
in the pin yeah
no one no one
born before 1990 knows what we're
talking about look if you've ever been
into spencer's gifts you remember those
are those still around
are malls still around
they call maul's covid factories
uh and then um not the architect the
analyst's ability to
kind of pause the program
which
seems like a very good
upgrade old matrix you know
we can just stop the program and slow it
down and he can he can
drop exposition bombs while that's
happening
and and uh that so a handful of new
things and just some new robots flying
around
and then they they kind of they still
treat this the story with respect
to a certain degree
while
kind of poking fun at reboots and
remakes at the same time which is
gremlins too yeah it's it's like yeah
it's like a way to kind of have your
cake and eat it too i'm not talking
about the orgasm cake from matrix
reloaded
and that stuff the the the direct sequel
kind of building on the mythology there
that's the stuff that didn't work for me
i just didn't care
um then maybe because i just don't
really care about the matrix as a
franchise i don't know the stuff that
interested me even though some of it was
kind of clunky and like you mentioned
kind of cringey was the uh
the meta stuff and the commenting on
this movie existing at all that's the
stuff that really worked for me
this is kind of like i don't know if
it's like
the the best way
to continue on with these movies
but
i could see potential for like
it would work as a good like series on
hbo which is what it looks like visually
it does it doesn't look that great and
when they kept showing the flashbacks of
the old movies where it's like grainy
yeah film and i'm like oh yeah i want to
go back and watch the original movies uh
especially the first one
but what i was lacking in it was that
that perfectness of what is
what is our goal
and what are the stakes yeah because i
didn't i kind of understood the goal was
that
their mission was to rescue trinity
to get her out of there
and
i'm not really sure why
because the the those two together
because remember um uh neil patrick
harris was like
this new matrix is great i've got my two
anomaly programs kind of locked in
and everyone
there's less desire for people to get
out of their pods they're very happy
they're sheeple
you know it's a comment have you seen
spiderman far from home
or whatever the new one is
home sweet home sweet home alone yeah i
have not but that's i mean that's or
ghostbusters afterlife do you watch the
new spiderman no i'm just saying like
that's what they're commenting on yeah
everything now is it's the same [ __ ] we
always criticize where you're just like
regurgitating
member berries yes yes and the member
berries and this were were
came with a wink and then that's to me
the smart part about it was that it
wasn't regurgitation it was
regurgitation
with a little
stick in your eye
which is like i get you yeah and and i
appreciate that
um
it wasn't more of the same but but neil
patrick harris was saying that's what
people want yeah and
alana wachowski is saying [ __ ] what
people want
let's do something different and for a
matrix movie you know
that's probably not what a lot of people
want but i appreciate
going there
and not just doing a drastic world type
software reboot we were on our way to
remake your world
change a few things i don't like to
paint the sky with rainbows idea
the the the crux of the film the the
goal
as it were is
not so much to to take down the entire
robot world it but it was to rescue
trinity
and then we discover that
uh
taking them out of the equation forcibly
resets the matrix to its previous
version because it can't function with
trinity and neo out of their pots
which is what i think happened
uh neil neil uh patrick harris lost all
of his power
um they uh
neo and trinity were like the new
power couple in in the matrix and they
could do whatever they want and so the
balance of power was disrupted leading
to potentially future conflicts future
sequels
in an hbo max tv show
where neo is not played by keanu reeves
anymore
i think survive the tricks just have
them animated you can do that i don't
know if if if the intention is to
continue making films there's an out for
that
um and then it it is
shown that
trinity is also the one or neo has given
her the power to be the one because she
flies at the end remember yeah
they have equal power now i guess and
they can rebuild the matrix however they
want girls get it done girls get it done
neil can't fly but she shows him how to
fly
it's a it's a it's a
a gender reverse uh kind of thing going
on
where
neo is no longer the one trinity is
whatever it's lovely
they're back together
they're alive again
which is risky to do because
you know you want some steaks that was
the nice part about the first one oh
yeah i remember that part in the first
one
joe pantalone is eating the steak so
you're talking about oh yeah yeah they
reference that in this they do yeah
neo's eating the steak and he's injured
that was a pretty gross-looking steak it
was it was like what does that uh i
think you should leave whether you're
eating the sloppy steaks what are sloppy
steaks it's a steak with water dumped on
it it's really really good
it reminded me of that just put douse in
water on your steak
it's a sloppy steak it was a little too
rare for my
that that thrust of the first one is
that timing you know the
the nebuchadnezzar's being attacked by
the sentinels and the shooting lasers
and cutting the ship up and they only
have so much time left
to escape but neo's still in the matrix
exciting oh yeah this movie doesn't have
any of that and all the action's boring
and bad mindless action is not on brand
she's right matrix is mind bone
philosophy and shiny type bbc yeah ideas
are the new sexy like again like i said
that's if you're watching the movie as
like a matrix sequel on like a literal
level
it's not very satisfying it's all the
other stuff it's the uh
the themes of the movie and just the
general kind of [ __ ] nature of the
whole thing
where it's like at the end you know
love wins out
i guess there's a love element in the
original matrix which is always the
thing that kind of worked the least for
me about it
when she when she revives him doesn't
their like digital hand go in and like
no he he sticks or he rips her whatever
she got shot in the back yeah yeah yeah
that was always like i don't know that
was the weakest aspect of that movie for
me he didn't think they had chemistry
they're fine i don't as characters i
don't really care about them all that
much
neil works as a protagonist for
that type of story as you've said
but this movie is all about that because
a lot of watchowski is in a different
place making different types of movies
isn't interested in something that looks
cool anymore
and and that wins out over a uh
cynical studio cash grab cash grab right
very well said jay very
well said i was i was surprised at the
outcome of this movie it's uh
it's fascinating it's fascinating i i
don't love or hate it no like i said i
like all the the themes and stuff but
the actual story and some of the
execution of it is not very good there's
some really clunky awkward dialogue it's
it's based in many ways this it's it's
bad in a lot of ways the scene where i
still loved every minute
[Laughter]
the scene where morpheus comes out of
the bathroom stall and counter reeves
acting in that scene i think he's trying
to act like someone with like anxiety
issues or something
it was a test
an experiment
he's doing some weird stuff and it's
really bad
yeah
thankfully keanu talks very slowly yeah
and he's like
he's like
what
what are you talking about
what word should i use
what word explains what is happening to
me
what exactly is this i'm like thank you
for talking slowly
neil patrick harris is talking quickly
it's like it's like the scene with the
architect was like oh yeah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah ergo there we
go
and you're like i guess the movie's too
smart for me because he's talking a lot
he says ergo a lot he does and he says
lots of words like that but i mean hey
it's well written because a computer
that is the architect of the matrix
probably would be pretty [ __ ] smart
probably wouldn't wouldn't talk like uh
you know james franco
[Laughter]
look
whatever happens but you know because i
i i've had girlfriends
so mike would you recommend the matrix
rebooted as it should have been called
uh
yeah
why not again if you got hbo max that's
true hbo max is great and we're not
sponsored by them so shut up
i love hbo max there's so much good
stuff on it
but i love the fact that new movies are
out in hbo max so for that alone if you
have it uh it's worth
worth watching one night if there's
nothing else on
nothing else you feel like watching i
should say i think that helps with the
anticipation of movies like this too
like big movies when you like because
you have to make a night of going to the
theater and it's like well the movie
better be really [ __ ] good i'm going
out of my way to see it we just watched
it on hbo max it's like yeah
the new matrix movie yeah i think though
our dream of of uh coronavirus
destroying movie theaters has taken a
bad turn jay unfortunately that
spider-man movie is like the third
highest grossing film in the history of
movies
or the history of the pandemic i forget
which which way the news twisted that
article but uh it's apparently it's
doing well um and then the i think the
matrix box office
is smaller
now the monetary end of it does hbo max
care do they have enough subscribers to
balance that out we don't know we've
discussed this before but uh yeah except
if you have hbo max watch it i would say
got atrial max in general because i got
lots of good stuff on there
uh what yen you sir you're gonna say no
no i'd recommend it okay um
not if you're looking for a good matrix
sequel though it's such a weird movie
which is what makes it interesting yeah
it doesn't it's not a satisfying sequel
really
but it's a more interesting sequel than
what a more traditional sequel would
have been
yeah um it's doing lots of stuff it
doesn't do it all very well some of it
does flat out bad
um but it's unique especially right now
like
this is the movie we need right now
one of those things
where it's like well just yeah like
the movie comments on all those things
that we criticize all the time about
studio nostalgia grab
sequels and reboots
that range against the machine cover at
the end was [ __ ] awful though yeah
but again was that intentional i mean
obviously it's a
a a female vocalist so there's something
going on there but it's so bad i looked
in the credits and i was like that's a
rage against the machine song isn't it
and then it's like written by morello
and uh you know all the other band
members and then it's it's the the band
that did the cover is called brass rage
so it's like the rage is in the title
that's one is that a cover like
specifically a cover band yeah of rage
against machine songs did they not have
the money to license a a rage against
the machine song i'm assuming it was an
intentional choice but it was like it
was like this is
yeah it was but it was like the vocals
were mixed way louder than the actual
music or something so it didn't have
that like hard hit that the end of the
first movie has yes it was really weird
it was really quiet and yeah and then i
used like like a like an old timey like
a dean martin song or something like why
not
so that's something kind of like
schmaltzy and old-timey just to contrast
the rage against the machine music
yeah doing like a weird cover of it but
the fact that it was a was it was it a
monetary decision we don't want to pay
for the sync license of a real rage song
or
is this
fourth movie
a cover
of the originals that's worse yeah like
is it
is is that even meta is the choice of
closing music music
song even that meta
and so i that's why i think this this
this movie's some kind of work of art
it's a modern day
work of art it's a modern day [ __ ] you
to the film industry
now the packet in front of you has our
focus group research
inside you'll find the breakdown
including key word association with the
brand the top two being originality and
fresh
which i think are great things to keep
in mind as you begin working on matrix
iv
it's something something special even
even if it doesn't work completely you
gotta admire at least that aspect of it
right right right and the scene
when the movie kind of glitches up
do you remember that the movie glitches
up
and then it goes error streaming error
and then hulk hogan pops up oh he says
hbo what's going on with your servers
oh
i pity the fool
okay
that's operating the hbo server is it
hulk hogan or is it mr tino
because mr t pities the fool not hulk
hogan that's true
they were both in rocky three together
how about it's both of them
they both pop up like is one person kind
of like morpheus in there yeah it's
morpheus and an agent yeah okay it's a
it's uh so it's hulk hogan in blackface
it's all going to blackface with a bunch
of gold chains that sounds about right
yeah it's a perfect roll for him yeah
