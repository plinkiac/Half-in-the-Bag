half in the
bag hey jay i just read in the paper that hbo max
canceled the new batman movie is that the one with the harry potter kid in it
no no they cancelled the bat girl movie the batman is with twilight boy not
harry potter boy so the twilight boy is gonna be playing batgirl ah just forget it you're
confused about the new merger of warner media and discovery plus which caused them to either combine or
eliminate hbo max leading to multiple layoffs and or cancellations
what remember the old days when you could just turn on your tv and
watch tv yeah now you've got to be an expert in corporate mergers acquisitions
ip branding and quarterly income reports just to know where to watch the new
reboot of your favorite 80s sitcom so let me get this straight first there was warner brothers then warner media
then time warner which was formerly called aol time warner which is all
owned by a t so warner media which owns hbo tbs
cinemax tnt etc has now merged with discovery brands
which has hgtv food network tlc the id channel a e
history channel travel channel science channel etc
so now do i got to change the password on my discovery plus app
and the password on my hbo max app no no there won't be those apps
anymore they're going to combine into one app called like warner discovery or
something maybe you'll have to cancel your old accounts and then create a new account on the new
app so that you can watch your favorite shows that will then be cancelled or junked for tax write-offs by wealthy
media executives oh wait do you think i should use my old password or should i make a new one who cares all i know is
that the world's a [ __ ] mess and i hate everything and now my soup is cold because i've been talking to you
hello hey mike where do you guys keep your ci3 replacement circuit boards for magnavox
models 89 through 95 uh what never mind i'll just use a replacement
board from an old 92 s895 47 samsung what
hey you know i've been watching movies while i work on vcrs have you guys seen prey pray what's that every day i pray
for death huh pray it's it's the new predator film film
oh no sorry i meant the new corporate owned streaming digital content product that will someday no longer be able to
be seen due to a corporate merger buyout or acquisition what did you say about the spanish
inquisition oh sorry i gotta go got a customer talk to you later
who is that i have no idea what that man was talking
about uh i think that i know i don't know how i could hear him from way over there but i could that's enough
talking for today though let's just watch a movie oh that's a great idea let's see here i got the remote okay
oh looks like it's hulu is this a new predator or something looks like
predator based on the font but it's called prey
get out of the way of the screen oh oh oh sorry
oh oh look the movie's over i got kind of like a frog in my throat
are you feeling the same way jake yeah a little bit i got a little bit of a frog maybe
oh yeah that's much better perked me up a little yeah yeah i'm feeling very old well we watched pray
and unbeknownst to each other we both wrote intros for our review so you know what that means
how when did we have time to write intros we just finished watching the movie why do you want to hunt
because you all think that i can't i i are we gonna have the same intros
are we gonna have the same cynical little little dick at society jay go ahead we'll see we'll see taking place
in the 1700s native american aubrey plaza plays nauru a young comanche woman
that just wants to hunt but the men in her tribe just want her to stay in the kitchen and make them a sandwich but
everything changes when a predator comes to earth and starts hunting all the cgi animals and then naru's own tribe but
don't worry nauru will be just fine at all times girl gets it done
it's a new predator movie this time called pray from the director of 10 cloverfield lane dan trachtenberg brings
us this new predator prequel it takes place in the 1700s and the lead is a
female native american now great another remake gender swapping piece of
propaganda made to appeal to the feminazis and the neo matriarchy this
anti-male pro-woke piece of trash has ruined the legacy of predator films
wait no that was the predator from 2018. sorry i take all that back you know it's funny
both our intros had a little kind of girls get it done joke and i was looking around a little bit
and there is some of that like it's woke propaganda woke is a word that's lost any whatever meaning it had is out the
window so there's a little bit of that going around people complaining about that but what i was thinking of more than that is
like this isn't anything new this is like 90s disney animated stuff that's what the first half of this felt like to
be yeah i mean it was fairly straightforward on the nose you know a little too
this is what it is yeah and well reverse reactions i really enjoyed it um i don't really have too many
complaints um and i actually kind of liked it a lot but i
give it an a for effort and maybe a b minus or c plus for execution
yeah yeah i mean you your intro poked fun at the cgi animals i thought they looked
rather good until they moved the bear especially like the way he ran
was really awkward weird things weren't quite right but you know what i don't care anymore i don't care about
that stuff yeah no as far as like especially compared to the predator to
make this so stripped down so simple i think people forget what that first movie was yes in the
wake of like you know the alien versus predator movies and [ __ ] right um the thing i'm trying to figure out i
haven't decided yet is it too simple because if you take away the setting it
is basically the same movie as the first movie well it's a reboot all every fiber in my being says i
should probably not like this movie um but i i because i i'm sick of like
reboots and remakes and all that kind of stuff but the fact that it's like a native
american girl as her protagonist when before it was schwarzenegger marine all
the the fact that it takes place like so far
in the past in the 1700s and it ties in the ending ties in with predator 2 yeah
where they handed danny glover that old pistol the the flintlock pistol which implies
that after the events of this movie the predators came back and just murdered everybody i guess they took the gun they got their gun back somehow it was it was
a weird interesting way to do sql bait yeah well did you notice in the there
was like over the end credits there was you know like cave drawing backgrounds and it was telling the events of the
movie but it went on one step further it showed them at the end they have the gun and then another predator ship cuts down
comes down and then it cuts to black so i think it's a little hint that yeah but i don't want to see more of this like
this movie is fine yeah but i like that it's i like it as its own isolated like this is just another time a predator
came to earth i think i just like weird stuff like this because you have the native americans fighting the predator
predator versus a bear predator versus native americans predator versus
french fur trappers and it's just like like just so out of the element i read some kind of trash
novel in high school and i don't even remember what it was but it was like like a civil war
regiment the union civil war regiment got scooped up sucked into a different dimension
where they're on an alien planet and their their civil war technology that they had
with them was superior to this alien war that was going on they had like they had like cannons and
muskets and and they were fighting aliens like the civil war and i was like that was cool like it was like some kind of
dime store trash novel but i was like this is fun like i kind of
like the weird juxtapositions uh and and like the proto predator he wasn't quite he's still at some
technology obviously you have to have technology if you're landing in a spaceship yeah but he was still sort of
looked a little different than the one from the modern area
i don't know i i think i would have liked it i liked the movie well enough but it just looked too like clean and
slick and the cg added to that like that kind of stuff stands out more in like a period movie like if this they
would never do this but if this was like shot on like 16 millimeter and kind of like grainy sure it felt more like
gritty and raw but as it is it's like it is a hollywood movie so it feels like the slick hollywood version of what an
idea like this could be yeah and they compromised on uh
the fact that everybody speaks english which uh there is another version i
thought i had read beforehand that they filmed it two different ways they do a take in english and then taken
uh comanche so i was like oh i'm gonna watch the comanche version because i know the the everyone speaking english
is going to drive me nuts i've been practicing it's time i'm ready for my katamir
you really think you're ready but i had to watch that version because they didn't film it in two different uh
ways the comanche version that's on hulu is just dubbed okay so
i think and i'm sure they did that because they're like oh if everybody speaks english and we don't have an alternate version available people are going to be upset people are going to
say it's culturally insensitive blah blah blah blah and so they were just like ah we'll just dub it and we'll have the dub version available to to please
people that might be upset yeah i guess that and uh the dubbed version
the only way you could watch subtitles it didn't have just like regular like subtitles you could only you had to turn
on the full closed captioning so you'd get like sound effects cues and all that stuff so i had to shut off the comanche
dub version for those reasons and i watched just the regular english language nicely they respect the
language and bothered to translate it and do all that they i don't think they respected it so much as they knew if
they didn't make that available people would be angry so they half-assed it that comes in the
in the form of uh casting all actual native american people in the roles
because that's what was my first thought you mentioned aubry plaza i was like that girl does look a lot like aubrey plaza and then of course you know i
looked her up and she's uh she was on a show with aubry plaza she's on that show legion i guess which i've never watched
yeah she's done a lot of acting the brother that was his first role okay his name was
dakota uh something hold on david dakota
dakota beavers uh he didn't have any other credits other than this and he was good they were both really good i
thought she was yeah and she was good too i i you know people can say i don't know like mary sue or whatever she's too
powerful i thought they did a good job of establishing that it's not that she's great at everything she's
just very like observant and pays close attention and learns well right everyday i thought they did a good
job of establishing that she is a bit of a mary sue but more of a mary sue
because it's funny the the actress is part of the sioux tribe okay um in the movie she's comanche comanche yeah um
but uh in real life she she's uh actually quite quite a blend of
different ethnicities and heritages is his paternal grandmother was native american
of the sioux and lakota amber's paternal grandfather was of norwegian in some english descent
where's the twitter mob it's not a hundred percent
uh so some english descent surname mid thunder which actually that sounds like a native
american name mid thunder yeah uh because you know there's all the nature names in there and then which originates
in burgund hordaland norway was originally mid thun
amber's mother was born in bangkok thailand oh my god of european and chinese ancestry so well a lot of stuff
but you know you gotta you can't get away with casting non-native americans and native
american roles or non-anything and none anything roles for a movie like this i
mean that's that's a part of the whole lot concept of that movie it was on there the day called the 13th warrior
with antonio benderes oh yeah and he plays an i am i have met even fahalan even alabas
even rashid speaking of falling asleep during movies i think i fell asleep seeing that in the theater when it came out did you i'm
pretty sure i didn't i've never seen the whole movie yeah i saw that and it's like oh my gosh
yeah well now it's still a thing that's happening martin charlton because there was another player mexican
i'm supposed to do a thriller at universal but they want charlton heston to play a mexican
there there's an announcement that uh uh what's his stupid face oz the great and
powerful james franco was going to play who was he playing castro or something
is that right is that the announcement it's al castro yes james franco yeah
and he got called out by people like i was just shocked that he was still getting offered roles and things that's such a weird casting yeah we're treading
in some some choppy waters here jay but but it's good to work out these things and talk about them because you know i
i think like playing a stereotype or playing another ethnicity or
doing some kind of role that could be like mocking you know like that's of course
offensive but when it comes down to like really like kind of simple
changes like an actor has to act you can show so what you're saying is you would have
preferred if this movie had john wayne in brown face yes yes okay i i wanted uh
i wanted a hannah montana to play a native american
right see that's the compromise when i was talking about having the comanche dub available it's like well we know we have
to make this available but we're gonna half-ass it and just do a dub when i would have loved this movie it
was completely shot in comanche with subtitles but i can understand from a studio perspective why they didn't do
that sure but but it was distracting to hear people not just speaking english but
sounding kind of like modern english even it it kind of took me out of the movie
luckily there's not it's not every dialogue english which was nice yeah it was a little confusing when the one
frenchman who knew comanche he said i'm gonna i speak i learned comanche and you know i speak
english in english the thing is though in the very beginning of the movie they open it with uh
uh she's she speaks a couple lines in i assume comanche yeah it's like a poem
or something and then it continues on in english and it's like i i knew they were you have to do
something like that you can't just have the whole movie be in english and not address it yeah it's like uh
hunt for red october remember that alec baldwin plays super secret spy agent jack ryan
as a spy on a russian sub sean connery and all of his officers are in the mess hall and they're all speaking russian in
the first like maybe 10 15 minutes is is subtitled they're all russians
and the seventh angel poured forth his bowl into the air and a voice cried out from heaven saying and then they do uh
like a camera move and then it very kind of subtly transitions into english and now shimmer comes back out it's almost
like now you're hearing it it's like their perspective pretend in your mind they're speaking russian that's what you
have to do and they did that in this a little bit could have done it a little closer to
how they did it in red october but yeah but again when i say like the movie i'm picturing like a grittier version of
this like 16 millimeter actual practical blood people speaking
actual comanche yeah real blood would have been nice a couple of real animal shots
uh would have helped yeah it would have been less comical when the predator punched the bear
i was happy there wasn't a bunch of dumb subplots it was so straightforward
it was like 100 minutes maybe 90 with credits it was very simple a
woman wants to prove herself and then she proves herself yes boom this is our story this is the
predator yes and i think for the most part it had what 98
rotten tomatoes score right and then in the 80s of i i love my reviews
and uh i don't even pay attention to reviews half the time anymore and you know there there there's a a a wee bit
of interjection of of politics into this because they're like well sperman is
propaganda and you know i i i noted a couple of those which i'll of course read to you but it's it's like basic
storytelling you have to have a character overcome obstacles that's what stories
are i know and and no one like okay well let me let me find something here okay real quick um i
pulled i i did most of my uh my stuff from rotten tomatoes but i
found this that's where you get the cream of the crop of yeah bad reviews uh i found this on imdb
throw in 110 pounds of skinny girl power versus all of nature and alien predators
and see how the movie really turns out only let's remove the laws of physics
pretend physiology doesn't exist make her a navy seal and now we see if the
audience is impressed still have doubts let's introduce evil dumb french trappers to really prove her moral high
ground in case anyone has any doubts i really don't know why the story had to be told this way
the original predator made minced meat out of them out of an elite squad of mercenaries who literally went into the
jungle with enough ammo to wipe out a small city these are aliens who have the intelligence and machinery to travel
through space and time we expect a young girl in the 1700s to outmaneuver outsmart and defeat an alien
who is 8 feet tall and 300 pounds she can learn to use a hand musket just from taking mental notes
and she can craft booby traps with a flint axe she can also understand alien technology in half of a day
i guess if we were to believe in a predator alien then we must also believe that this super girl can exist in her
time as well the first predator was awesome this falls in the same pile of sequels that should have never been made
um uh the the angle of uh the you know the
feminists it's now they're taking away our our precious male heroes and replacing like that that's all nonsense
to me there's some sort of valid points in this but if you were to look at this because i've
made jokes about the the the feminist hero oh like the strong female flipping and exploding things and this
you know to be deadpool's advocate here this kind of falls into that a little bit
because some of the stuff she does is a little bit over the top and i have a way to rework it oh which will make me which
would have made me happy but i'm still very happy with the movie but um you know no one complains when
tom cruise is flipping off a motorcycle and jumping on a helicopter and exploding you know yeah or bruce willis
in the die hard movies is the sequels was doing crazy things throwing cars and whatever um no one really complains when
it's a man doing it but well like i said that's her whole character is is she's
able to train yeah she's able to be very observant and figure out how this [ __ ] works she's good which is what makes her
a unique character which is why she's the protagonist yes she wants your protagonist and and she goes through her
struggles yeah i was surprised early on when they're telling her to like go back go back to the the tribe and they just
kind of beat the [ __ ] out of her like her own tribe they're just beating her up i was a little surprised they went i
assumed it was gonna be so much more clean than that and she was just gonna be uh superwoman so no no like yeah she
gets caught in quicksand at one point she gets caught by the trappers the french guys her culture is uh
the hunter-gatherer native american men go out and do the things and the women stay back
and cook and tend to the wounded and she wants to break that mold and she
wants to be a warrior uh she practices with her ex they go on the hunt for the lion a lion has dragged
off one of their own they go to find him and she does have an encounter with the lion
but fails yeah and her older brother is the one who defeats the line and brings it back to the cap and that's that's
that's the perfect like bam knock down that protagonist a little this is what she's trying to do she doesn't succeed i
hope later in the story she succeeds she can get up and be stronger again yeah mostly good reviews uh one star review
where is the man fight not girl fight this is dream girls
dream girls isn't that a movie about like a musical eggs it just says girls in the titles so he
used it well you think he i think the translation means like this is a fantasy like this girl can't really do this he
should have thought that comment through a little bit more because it wasn't very clear what he was trying to say yeah right right here's a half star okay this
film simply tries to destroy what has been established in the franchise which is
probably the goal the director had uh the president i'm going to assume the
director just said hey you know what we haven't seen in a predator movie before
yes a a female protagonist that we haven't seen something said in the past everything kind of fits into place the
predator is ridiculous he always seems harmless
the protagonist is the classic quote mary sue her arc is not convincing at all
i'll give him credit arc was spelled right
he didn't spell it ark no half a star girl power exactly what a
predator movie didn't need political pandering to feminists took
precedent over creating good sin c-i-n-e-m
now synonym cinum cinnamon i could see great cinnamon
humans cinnamon took precedence over creating good
cinnamon and it shows in every scene where implausible girl power is rubbed in your
face to score pc points with the matriarchy
i hate the world that we live in yeah um so that that seems to be considering you
got 89 audience rating it's a very minority of people that
think that the film was made specifically uh as a feminist propaganda piece which
which i think it's just a little twist on the genre but is our girl
uh female character a little too powerful uh when compared to
male action stars who are also too powerful whatever and she never really fizz sure she's 110
pounds and not doesn't have the strength of a man but the strength of a man
couldn't defeat a predator the strength of a [ __ ] bear couldn't defeat a predator so it doesn't
that's what makes the predator scary because she doesn't go on a in in a physical like there's no arm wrestling
scene no she has to use her wits she's using wits and she's attacking from afar and she's using traps and blah blah blah
blah did schwarzenegger ever like get in the fist fight with the predator no
he sets up a bunch of traps and he still almost fails he's far away from the predator yeah and the girl knows that
and she's got the little axe with the rope that flies back and established that earlier it's a little like cartoonish how efficient it works but uh
uh but if i were to add a layer a plot layer i was really happy with
um you go back to the 1700s right what do you do like they added in all these
different set pieces and scenes that all nothing dragged there was an escalation
to the the action scenes yes yes which if i had a complaint not to get too off track and it's not really off track it's
at the first half like i said it's very similar to the original movie yeah and it's like well we've seen the predator
before so it's hard to make a mysterious i guess you're trying to do it from the perspective of the characters but like
we know where this is all going so the first half drags a little bit because of that because it's just like i guess is
yeah unlike the first movie where it's like what the [ __ ] is this thing in the woods but we're kind of watching it through the eyes of
a native american in the 1700s yeah like that's well that's yeah that's the there's her reaction to the technology
that it's using was interesting yeah more so than just where we see like you know it's silhouette in the distance and
it's walking it's like yeah it's a predator we know it's pretty it's not as creepy as the first one right what are you gonna do that's why i say where it's
like the first half it's very similar to the structure they balance that out with
her character establishment the establishment of how the tribe works the mother the use of the herbs to heal i
mean there's lots of little things in this movie that all kind of add up yeah because there's there's parallel scenes
there's there's really nice parallel scenes the the the predator sees the rabbit being hunted by the wolf
and he re and and the movie's called prey not predator which is clever and and the predators watching and
uh he realizes that the wolf is the bad guy and so he understands the dynamic of yes
and later on she uses that to her advantage when she kills the fur trapper who's who's threatening her with the gun
she's like he's not gonna kill me and then there's a cool shot where she steps aside as the predator walks past her
because she knows she's she's the prey yeah he's the the fur trapper guys the
predator she kind of figures out why he's there and what he's doing um that's what i've always liked about
the predator as a movie monster that's what makes him different than like the aliens or something yeah he's not just
to kill everything right he's there to hunt big game and um
and then if things are a threat to him he'll take them out um but there's parallels like like the the rabbit and
and the wolf and then there's a scene where she's healing herself with herbs and then it cuts to him
healing himself with his own medicine so they're they're similar in nature yeah but the i like the the quicksand
scene that was a nice setup for later on uh i and that was a fake out because i'm like oh she's gonna get sucked down in
that quicksand and and the mud it's like a mud pit and she comes out and then the
predator is going to show up and not see that see her like yeah like arnold did perhaps that's true next scene she's
washed herself off and then the brother who's she's in competition with um
uh she fights the the lion and gets knocked unconscious and wakes up in the teepee and she's like what happened you
know then it cuts to the brother and he's walking back with the lion head and the carcass he's like i killed the lion
that threatened our camp i'm the i'm the alpha male of this tribe and i thought
that it was going to come out later that it was really the predator that killed the lion and that the brother was like
i'm taking this carcass home and i'm gonna pretend like i did it and he's a fraud yeah and then she overtakes the
brother he [ __ ] lied about the lion he's a fake he's a scaredy cat he ran
away he ran away when he saw the predator killing the lion and then he pretended to be like nope
so she really had to prove her worth and the brother really was a quality character because he sacrificed himself
at the end spoilers uh but uh
instead of her being uh what what is some complaints
from people is that her uh gender and weight and physical ability
seems far outmatched far undermatched to the predator the
predator has outmatched her people thinking that's super unrealistic despite it being a movie
it would have been i think neater if she was uh she
usurped the the male authority in in the village and said you know yes my brother has
been leading you but he is a fraud and i and you can trust me
come on comanches all 50 of you i'm going to lead you into
battle as a whole group of people yes and and you you you and you you're going to tie
ropes over here you and then you know a bunch of them get killed of course because it's battle but but she proves
her worth other than just being physically adept she's also uh learns um
to be socially uh adept in in maybe be taking on more
of the patriarchal role in the village and that's the that that
would have been a better like girl power moment uh where it's like i always make fun of
girl power as being purely physical yeah uh uh what's angelina jolie flipping backwards
as trains explode underneath her like that which there's a few moments up in this when she's there's a lot of that in
this and that that to me isn't girl power girl power comes more from
intelligence intelligence and wits in addition to physicality she's using
it but it could have been oomphed a little bit more uh because they're talking about their
social structure a lot in the beginning yeah you gotta yeah you gotta drain the bread or you gotta make the bread and
the thing and you gotta get in the kitchen and make me a salmon you gotta make the sandwiches for the the warriors
that go out and do the real work you're just a lady yeah and you can't do that kind of stuff but then she proves that
she can lead the tribe into battle uh and and that i think would have
satiated the the guys uh the basement basement dwelling in so spoilers it
wouldn't have that would have made it worse oh now she thinks he can the woman's taking over the man's
leadership role i mean i get it again i'm not pro-woke or anti-woke i'm
neither i just think it's gotten out of control there was before the uh the new jurassic world movie came out like the
first promotional image for it was chris pratt standing next to black lady and
that was it was just an image of two people standing there they're standing there and people were complaining
it's just a black woman existing it's just a photo what are we doing to be honest
uh if if the man's man predator movie was the 2018 predator movie
which was like like diarrhea on the screen i'll take this and that over that any
day hey baxley if your mom's vagina were a video game it'd be rated e for everyone
i'm sure the girl could might not be able to do a backflip and and put a hatchet in the head of a
predator uh but it's more fun to watch than whoever that [ __ ] guy was in the the predator oh
god our little jacob tremblay with his predator mask on on halloween remember that where autism is a superpower
or whatever the [ __ ] happened in that movie but this movie ruined the integrity of the predator franchise right right i was like
even like going next to the like the macho ness cause that's the whole thing with the first movie that that image of
carl weathers and arnold schwarzenegger you know uh giving each other a high five or whatever that's like the meme
from that movie but that like that's what that movie is about like even the machoist of macho men are not uh enough
to take on the predator so we've seen that and then even like and i liked a lot of people didn't but i liked
predators the robert rodriguez oh yeah yeah yeah it's that's with uh
brody adrian brody that was a good one it's not bad it was a good concept like like like scummy criminals yeah like
dropped onto an alien planet throw him on an alien planet but even adrian brody like he's a pretty scrawny dude but they
tried to buff him up for that movie a little bit but then yeah they're all like scummy criminal characters and i
like the scene where the predator fights a samurai in the cornfield or whatever not a cornfield but like a wheat field
yeah yeah um but but again that one again is like yeah lots of vulgar
manly men you know man if we ever make it home i'm gonna do so much [ __ ] cocaine
i'm gonna rape so many fine [ __ ] so it's like okay we've seen all this
before the predator same thing it's like yeah you want to make a movie with a little native american lady fighting a
predator like fine i i i have a like a soft spot in my heart for for
schlock and time traveling predator i mean not even time traveling it's just they they were
around back it takes place in the past yeah i would i'll be happy if we have another predator movie
uh predator versus uh king arthur's uh court
king arthur they think the predator is like uh it's like army of darkness yeah he's
come from the sky to protect us and it just murders everybody yeah nights like nights and uh with the
swords fighting the predator yeah well that's that's what this this movie took that little bit from the end
of predator 2 when they give danny glover the gun and you're like oh [ __ ] they've been coming here for a long time
it's like hey what if we expanded that into a movie boom simple sure works is is in continuity
with the other movies um not tons of pointless nods and references to the other movies there's
one line that they took from the first one if it bleeds we can kill it
but that's fine because that's like the most perfect line that's ever been written for a movie yeah and it makes
complete logical sense in the 1700s or modern times for sure so
i was okay with that one little nod i think at the end she's like come on come on now do it a little bit i thought it
was really awkward when she says get to the chopper because it's like that didn't make any sense in the
context of this the guy who chops wood to build log cabins i think they did that in the predator
they said get to the chopper it's like stop it stop it just stop it shut up everything okay back there
what would be a great era the napoleonic wars
i just want to see a predator like fight an army
well the american civil war would be kind of oh yeah yeah would it be the two sides of the civil war have to team up
to fight the predator they have to put their differences aside oh yeah now we're talking like like what
ifs kind of things yeah it doesn't historically like this this could happen that's when you get quentin tarantino
involved we're gonna rewrite history although although if yeah like small scale like this yeah all these you know
some incident somewhere uh forget history forgot it yeah that's kind of like there's a movie
in the 80s called zone troopers it took place during world war ii and uh american soldiers
meet an alien
what's he saying maybe that he's a soldier from outer space oh and it's just a small-scale
little thing about the these random troops that are off on a mission that they get uh into a skirmish with an
alien so it's not about the bigger uh world war two stuff happening it's just a
small little story with these characters i'd be all down for that maybe at some point the predator could fight aliens
that sounds like it'd be pretty awesome what like et's
sure e.t will throw like a speaking spell at it and then just
throw but put a bunch of reese's pieces on the ground and make the predator slip in like home alone
there you go predator fighting e.t in a house in the suburbs like home alone yes you replace macaulay
culkin with an e.t yeah et's et's home alone
i made my family disappear
oh man i just pictured the shots
the heat seeking and it pans along all the stuffed animals and it seems it's easy to space with the
heat signature hiding next to the cash basket
but e.t has the ability to fly oh wow and he's got his magic finger and he's
got a magic finger that can heal so he has some advantages maybe that's why the predator's after him they want
to uh harness his healing technology yes depending on when it takes place because they have that technology the predators
so this would have to be like a prequel that's that's your spielbergian ending when the predator is like mortally
wounded and like gushing out like fluorescent green green blood yeah and the e.t comes in and
uses his finger to heal the predator mm-hmm and then the predator gets up and like
respects e.t and they both get on their spaceships like like
their respective spaceships that are that are in the middle of the street in this suburban neighborhood and elliot
comes home you have a de-aged you you bring out uh uh what's his name
henry thomas i'm henry thomas and you de-age him to a 12-year-old it looks really [ __ ] awful
it looks like uh young colin robinson in the current season of uh of what we do in the
shadows uh henry thomas gets on the bike with e.t and they fly
this gigantic predatorship is directly blocked the predator will have like a like some kind of
device that flies them around it'll be new oh so not like a full their full spaceship no it'll be like a like a
hovercraft kind of thing that he stands on like that thing he-man has and the masters of the universe movie there you
go yeah yeah
and he's like shooting lasers at them
et's like little hood gets blown off
we gotta make it to the 80s shopping mall e.t we'll lose him in spencer's gifts so you have a whole blues brothers
chase scene throughout the mall yeah with the predator they land in the mall and elliot's peddling the bike and
cutting around the corner and then the predator's like flying through the mall like smashing through stores elliot's
bike the tires will fall off okay and the bike will collapse and they'll roll through the doors into
a uh a roller rink that's attached to the mall and they'll start running through the
crowd of roller ring people and the predator will land and jump off this thing
i don't see them going around the roller rink and then his feet will form wheels
like they come out of the bottom of his boots or something
can you play some kind of like roller rink song abba's dancing queen
and he's just trying to like like like follow them he's just on a mission to get them yeah maybe they have something
that he needs sure that explains why he doesn't slaughter everyone in the roller rink
predator versus e.t the movie i like it predator phone home
um because he's trapped yes i like it jay
uh so j would you recommend pray
yeah that's all right that was all right it was all right check it out it's on hulu it's free yeah
cheers jay nice to have a cold beer after a long movie discussion huh
