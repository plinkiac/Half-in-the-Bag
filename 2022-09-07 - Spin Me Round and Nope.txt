hit power that's like it's it's it's going to power up the movie right
we could try that i don't know that's not what we've done for the last 73 movies we've watched but maybe it'll go
quicker this way wordify hit okay that might do you hit okay once to rent the
movie and then you hit okay again to confirm that you're renting the movie then you hit okay again to play the
movie oh my god it's asking for a 46-digit passcode did you have one written down i think i think i remember
it let me see the remote i'll try it i've got notes let me try i wrote down notes for all my passcodes wait wait i
think i got it oh that's the wrong one let me try again wait a minute wait a minute i used this unofficial batman
trivia challenge book to save all my passwords and passcodes in it every
every 116th letter i circled oh and that is
one passcode for a site but i didn't write down which site it was oh so you
don't know if it's amazon or if it's like like a voodoo we'll see right here i got i got i think this is like netflix

what should we try to guess the 46 digit passcodes can we look on amazon and see
if nope is available on vhs no i don't know we can just put it in the vcr maybe
we could call jordan peel and ask him to transcribe the film over the phone for us okay hang on
that's not a phone that's that's a remote oh watching movies is too hard
now i remember the old days when i would turn on the boob tube
and there would be seven channels and i'd turn the dial and the channels would come in
and every so often there would be an illegal broadcast
of someone someone pressing towing bean tiles on the ground and talking about
the government takeover and i would watch that and i would think that it was part of the jack benny show oh like it
was a bit but then it would fade out and i and i and i would look outside and there'd be a car driving by with like a
big satellite on the roof so i think it was an illegal broadcast but so was jack benny
is this the farmer's almanac because i'd like to find out if it's gonna rain next month
oh both the movies are over oh oh i
didn't even watch them oh did you fall asleep again i did oh but
i rewatched them tomorrow well how about i just explain to you what happened in them
no oh how about we have a cold beverage well that sounds like a
good idea before we talk about the films historically a cold beverage has always perked me up yeah and it got me out of
my old folk funk
when did beers get so heavy
oh god did you do it yeah but i injured my hand i'm gonna have to go through six weeks of therapy
for uh oh
oh man i feel the life coming back to me i feel so much better now
you know the great thing about this framing device it'll never get old no yeah
anyway do you want to talk about these motion pictures ah yes
i would love to okay our first film oh we do we have intros
uh no no bit no intros on the fly intros on demand
iod i'll start with spin me around okay
tuscan growth has a program but they take all the top managers to italy amber pack your bags
what you're going to italy spin me around is the new film from director jeff beingna
whose previous works include horse girl
uh what's the movie with every plaza and uh uh came out in 2017. oh you already failed
no no no this is part of the process and albert and uh uh alison britt um the
little hours the little hours and uh something else life after beth
and also with aubry plaza okay uh joshie joshie yes i've seen joshie uh so
this is the new film from director but jeff baina and it stars allison brie uh aubry plaza
fred armisen tim heidecker molly shannon zack woods
and a slew of other cast of people that are in the film
the film is a story about uh allison brie who works at a
a a chain italian restaurant called
tusken tuscan tuscan something the tuscan sun
i don't know it's it's a knock off of olive garden and she gets uh invited to
go to a retreat as a manager she's a manager little ray howard is in it
that's not his name by the way you called him that on the last episode what's his name it's like little rel something
because i saw there was some comment on the last episode i thought it was a little ray lil ray howard it's lil
lil rel howery oh boy which is why yeah you glance at it looks like it says little ray howard
okay i'm sorry lil rey howard look i'm sorry lil rel howery
uh is in the film look guys next in the study working what is this clue he's killing colonel mustard with
the lead pipe uh and uh elsa bree wins the prize as one of the
managers to go to this retreat in tuscany italy for all the managers nationwide managers
of this this terrible chain of italian restaurants to go to some like culinary experience in italy
and uh uh things go wild
and that's all i'm saying right now because we don't want to show too much trailer footage because youtube will flag our video anytime there's a song in
the trailer that you get flagged for the song youtube is just a mess
it's a nightmare as they say so that's that's that um
uh i guess we're out we're out of the description phase right now we're gonna start talking about the film okay can
only get better from here yeah and just in case we slip into spoilers spoilers until we talk about nope
zip to this timeline if you haven't seen spin me round first of all i'd recommend it i'd recommend it okay then
uh if you've seen spin me around watch this review if you haven't maybe skip ahead and watch uh watch spin me around
first and then come back and watch the review but but skip the nope if you don't give a crap about spin me around
oh no you need to excuse yourself i'm sorry is that okay i mean
i don't want you to miss out this is supposed to be hysterical i i first heard about this film
i watched a little bit of the office hours podcast with
with tim heidecker and friends i keep getting that confused with the office ladies podcast which is
angela and jenna fischer just talking about every episode of the office fred armisson is is frequently on as a
guest an in-studio guest i had never heard of this film and they were talking about going to the premiere
big premiere last night in hollywood at the london hotel it was kind of confusing yeah we were like huh they
asked me what my character's name was blank do you know now yeah what is it
so many people in it that i like well i have discovered that i guess i'm a fan of this director yeah liked a horse girl
and i was like oh he always works with the same people molly shannon shows up in a lot of them oh shannon uh allison brie and then
aubry plaza which i just found out he's married to so that explains that um and they seem to just kind of like hey i
got an idea let's just go make this thing and we'll [ __ ] around in italy for a few weeks right and that that was sort
of like the like the indie version of the adam sandler model except all these people are way more interesting and
talented yes they are not complete check cashing hacks yeah like we'll go to italy and
make this movie but we should try and do something interesting with it and i guess the dr i watched a couple interviews with the director he did um
he did the youtube rounds the press junket rounds youtube press junket
we made fun of that with uh uh neil blomkamp when that demonic movie yes
the one guy interviewing him from his car hi neil how are you doing today
good how are you doing good oh man um it is an honor to talk to you sir
oh thank you and so uh this this jeff baina guy the director was like the lady started off talking
about alfredo sauce she's like alfredo sauce is the way you portray it in the film is disgusting i will never look at
alfredo sauce the same again that's great i'm glad i'm glad i had that much of an
impact on your life and then he's like he's like i'm glad you got something out of the film
and i'm like mission accomplished um watching watching spin me around i
was like this director he's just dripping with cynicism he
hates people oh fun fact about me is i used to be a twin uh almost because my sister died in
utero cool that's a really fun fact but okay and i
i think i love that because i hate people too this film is so like well it makes sense that he's
with aubry plaza then because she's so sarcastic and dry there's a lot of sarcasm to this there's a lot of like
there's you know obviously there's the hatred of the corporate mentality um
the the way people act in in social settings how how
dumb people are i mean it's just seething with contempt for the human race and i think that's
why i loved it was that there was no kitschy uh
heartwarming indie kind of stuff to it but it was very tongue-in-cheek
in terms of yeah i mean right from the poster which looks like an old cheesy
romance novel and i got excited just from the opening credits i noticed the score for the movie and the show's like
playing it completely straight the scar was done by uh pinot dinagio who did all of uh brian de palma's movies
so it has that kind of like is he a wine i'm just curious he is now
oh did he die no oh it'd be funnier if he died i guess he died and they put his ashes in a vineyard yeah and he grew
beautiful pinot pinot grapes yeah no the glass of pinot denali i want to turn
into a million barrels of pinot yeah but no he did the score for the movie he did all the brian de palma movies and it has
that kind of like super serious melodramatic kind of over the top but played straight just the position yeah a
juxtaposition of how goofy and stupid everybody is
i just want one good one
so that coupled with the first few shots with these beauty shots of the these
meals being prepared and it's just the i have a friend that used to work in restaurants like those types of
restaurants and he'd say i'm not a cook i just heat up food and so you see just yeah these gross
looking plates of uh pasta the alfredo sauce in bags
when that when that started i was laughing hysterically non-stop
it was very akin to the opening of willy wonka where there's the factory making all the
candy but they have that beautiful score playing over that and the font too is like this pinkish kind of
romantic uh lush font choice juxtaposition once again the
the cold harsh realities of a corporate uh italian restaurant chain
uh the pot the pasta being put into boxes and the alfredo sauce coming out of machines
it's so cynical i'll tell you a little story i don't tell many stories and this is
the most uninteresting story you'll ever hear okay i think about three or four times in my
entire life i went to a place called panera bread company and i'm waiting to
get my food put up on the counter where they put all the food and you could see all the
little characters in the background pressing down the panini press and it all kind of looks like a restaurant
and looks like is the key word and then i think an employee broke protocol
because they have a soup heater machine out front that i
i'm not sure if he's supposed to take out the metal soup container and bring it in the back and then come back out but this kid he
was he was um uh over overweight
with a disgusting disgusting beard and maybe a nose ring
and a dirty apron and he comes out of the back with maybe about a 10 pound bag plastic
bag of broccoli cheddar soup with the sealed plastic cap
on it and he undid the plastic cap and he turned it over and he just started
dumping it into the thing until it was all gone yeah something tells me you're supposed to do that in the back i'm not naive i realize there's
not a chef in the back with fresh broccoli and ingredients making the soup
yeah and then the the the panera bread company truck parked out back
gave it all away once i was leaving and i'm like okay you know i'm not i'm not stupid uh seeing that in the movie in
that tone just just set it set the stage it set the tone for the whole movie
uh and it applies to all the characters too the fraudulence yeah the front it's a front
and i just i loved it i loved it
allison brie is uh picked for this not contest but
they pick uh managers from restaurants and flying to italy to teach them about the culinary arts which which i
discovered in one of his uh jeff bain of the director's uh youtube interviews is that it's
somewhat based on a real story oh okay not all the romance and all that kind of
crazy stuff but the idea that a manager of a quote unquote unnamed
italian chain restaurant he doesn't want to get sued exists in the u.s
but he said a manager had a similar experience where they fly 10 or so managers out
to tuscany italy and they have a thing and they taught him how to cook bolognese
and they had them instead of staying in a luxury italian villa they put them up
in kind of like cheap dorms and she's like it was this was a [ __ ] waste of time it was a miserable experience i flew home but of course
this plot has more nefarious purposes
because um and it was really kind of like obvious when uh tim heidecker and zach woods
uh gabe from the office aka gabe from the office tim's character's name fran
and zach wood's character is named dana and so they obviously they both have
non-gender-specific names which could be interpreted as female so uh and then and everyone else sits there
is female as females perhaps even within a certain age range with the exception of molly shannon so i think it's like
every year he's just like whatever i'm not doing my research find 10 10 female managers and bring
them out here the odds are one of them will be attractive and then they find the history photos locked in the vault
of all the past years and and the sleazy owner is posed next to the most attractive
female in the group and it seems to be a scam for him to put the moves
on uh but but it you know it gets more complicated than that i'm just saying if something sketchy is going on here maybe
cat has something to do with it
this program sucks
well it's a it's a weird movie because yeah it's like this it kind of feels like a
not parody of a thriller but like a comedy with these thriller elements that are played mostly straight even though
everything's so ridiculous um there's obviously the romantic angle with allison breeze character she's like
oh maybe if i go to italy maybe i'll meet somebody it'll be romantic she's naive she's naive to uh to
not only the corporate world but the world to men yeah so i got all these photos from the
other manager trips do you notice anything um there's regular ones and there's
crazy ones like they're like they're making him so patient and stuff yeah but look closer her backstory is she just
got out of a pretty intense relationship where i think the guy was
demeaning to her or there was some kind of angle to it there's something weird yeah she just doesn't stand up for
herself she's very like demure and right kind of mousy yeah i technically took a
year off to open a restaurant um with tablets at every table but
my ex put all the debt on my credit cards and killed my credit and it went under so i'm back and
now i'm here all right uh and and shockingly really bad reviews i guess
that's not too surprising because if you're looking at this as just a comedy it's a very specific tone and it's very
like dry yeah except for when it's not which is what i say when the improv stuff happens sometimes it gets a little
sillier and let's see my my great uncle invented skorts sports
sports okay but the general story is played so kind of dry and serious like i mentioned the
music and that and that's that's a lot of the comments that i saw
review-wise like the tone for me is like right up my alley and and that's one of the funnier
parts to me is the complete total sham
of a of a cooking class yeah you got that the the
the chefty cuisine who's in charge of all the she's like okay here's what we're doing today
we're making this and you know tim heidecker's character he's like he's like the the wannabe gastro
uh chef yeah talking about liquid nitrogen and he he wants to be more when he was on like a reality show yes yeah
where he competed against children and he lost uh he's a fraud yeah and he's he's doing
his best and he wants to like learn things and she's like no we're boiling the noodles we're putting in and she
doesn't care and and then it evolves into we're watching videos like life is beautiful it has nothing to do
with anything they're just ki it takes place in italy yeah they're killing time
so that the the owner of this company um can can run his scam
but like you mentioned the the kind of serious topic of obviously taking advantage of women it's never it
never becomes like a message movie so i can see that not working for some people or it's like maybe you should take this
more seriously and that's that's the the normal sequence of events but it's that
it just gets completely insane at the end it falls apart in the best way for me
it's it's more raunchy but it has a bit of a sit-commie vibe to it
with the oh it's things are just a misunderstanding i was going to mention corny but it works
given the the tone of the rest of the movie if there was a great great sitcom about
managers of the tuscan grove like the office where there's different branches of dunder mifflin right
at the tuscan grove show this would be a really great two-parter
episode special episode shot on location yeah where where this this wacky thing happens with
the ceo the david wallace character in the tuscan grove empire
uh very kind of light-hearted deals with some serious issues but also has a
compelling mystery and lots of twists and also just gets really weird
it gets really weird last episode we talked about
the chekhov's gun theory this movie it's the
chekhov's wild boar oh that's yeah we didn't even mention that wild boars play into the story you
could uh you could get lost there are boars boars
oh i don't really smoke don't inhale then okay
i've become a much bigger fan of allison brie i've liked her since community i've
never watched a single episode of community um i've seen her in all
seven seasons of mad men i've recently watched all of glo oh yeah which is amazing she's very good
at playing pathetic yes she she's good at playing the the naive
character that gets caught up in a more complex story
so much brick forget if you just hand me your passport so hold on to them before it's time to head home
yes sir that's it now you're mine
he's so fun we're getting kidnapped we're getting have you read garcia marquez
I don't think so well yeah later in the movie when she starts to kind of become
suspicious of this whole thing with the boss you know it's very convenient for twittus that
she immediately you know meets the the ceo of this company and they're already having this beautiful romantic day she
gets swept of it up in it at the moment but then as as it goes along he takes her to a party and
you see like you can see that's where she's starting to kind of think like hey maybe this is too good to be true
but i'm still going to be polite i'm still going to have hope that this is a real thing like yeah she's good with
that stuff with uh without saying anything right right allison bree gets picked up in a van by
uh ben sinclair it's the bearded guy in the front seat is the dumb girl
and she starts talking about something allison brie's emotions internally
without saying a word are oh this girl seems nice
oh she's really really dumb just try to act polite
as best as you can yeah okay uh she plays it much more with much more
complexity of of that that delicate balance of of suspicion and politeness
that that is almost threaded throughout this entire movie of like oh
you have a folding table with a hot pot and one pan
and this is the like the mega kitchen of a major corporation and she's
watching it you know a lot of actors get credit for big
bombastic loud performances your leonardo dicaprio's where you're screaming and yelling and
and crying and emo emoting but i think the real talent of acting is subtlety
and uh expressing that exact feeling you get if you're in that situation
like you are thrust into this like pathetic class that's highly suspicious
and uh immediately yeah that's the thing it's not like a slow revelation that this is all up front it's like immediately
you're like this is ridiculous we're gonna have a lot of fun here eat a lot of great food learn about italian
culture and most importantly grow as people
did you know the very first assembly of photographs to create a motion picture was a two second clip of a black man on
a horse and that man is my great great grandfather great there's
another great nope is the latest film from jordan peele this one's about aliens
is it is it as good as get out nope
is it as creepy as us nope is it another step in jordan peels uh
transformation into m night shyamalan yeah no no no
kinda not really it's nope
there's my intro uh yeah nope i saw i think i saw a tv ad for it it
was like jordan p from the mind of jordan peel and a couple of little images never watched the full trailer i
don't think i did either and then never uh got off my ass to go watch it in the theater
i think it did like really well opening weekend and then second weekend was like a huge drop
because the other german peel movies have done pretty well which is worth pointing out he's one of the the
filmmakers that can get a movie made based on his name now which is more and more rare where the promotional
materials are all built on the filmmaker like that doesn't happen anymore it's like tarantino and
who else that's still where that's like the marketing is like it's this guy you know who made the movie yeah colin
trevorrow colin trevorrow of course but uh yeah where it's like the filmmaker is the iep because it's not a marvel movie
or but uh as my intro alluded to i don't think this is as good as other movies but i
think it's weird and interesting on its own i kind of like that
because get out is like i don't know objectively it's a pretty solid movie
just as far as like a straightforward movie goes us is a little more abstract and weird and if you look at it
literally it kind of falls apart you have to look at it as like a nightmare but it's really creepy and interesting
would you call it the jackie brown of the quentin tarantino filmography filmography wait which one
us no no uh nope nope um where you have reservoir dogs pulp
fiction oh yeah and then it's like and then you get to jackie brown and you have
thousands of college students coming in and then they're expecting one thing and they're like who's pam greer yeah and
they they that was boring and then they all like are scratching their heads walking out yeah i think that's an apt
analogy yeah that's pretty good um because this doesn't have his other movies have obviously the kind of social
commentary we don't feel that way about jackie brown by the way no jackie brown's my favorite tarantino we'll just throw that in but the expectations that
were put on it based on especially after pulp fiction which was like the biggest movie ever
and then jackie brown is so slow in comparison and not flashy in the way pulp fiction was it doesn't have the uh
the snappy dialogue it's uh i mean it has a great soundtrack but it's not
instantly memorable the way pulp fiction was instantly iconic no jackrabbit slims
yeah yeah instead you've got robert forster talking about the fact that he's getting older and he got hair
plugs and that's the movie pam greyer complaining that she has a big ass now because she's in
her 40s it's not the cool characters from uh from pulp fiction and yeah this is kind
of the same way where it's like the the iconography of us all the people in the red jumpsuits the one glove like it's
instantly like recognizable and then this is just like uh uh daniel
kaluya however you pronounce his name it's just him being like mopey he's like the least
like uh like a likeable protagonist in a movie in a while and it's so slow
not in a bad way but it's a very slow movie but uh yeah it's it's odd i
would further compare it to an m night shyamalan movie where it's like it's not super realistic the uh the
characters are kind of odd and say things that don't feel realistic
did not tell you this [ __ ] was gonna come up here with a non-electrical camera let's go boy
everything about it's just weird and off [ __ ] you in a way that i can see being off-putting to some people but i really
liked it because of that
was a bad miracle i watched a trailer today i never watched it after having
seen the movie after having seen the movie and i i i noticed like yeah kind of like the
misleading intentionally misleading trailer about aliens and blah blah blah but then it
turns out and as a man who has a long history of star trek it's
very trek-ish in terms of premise
spoilers because there's nothing to skip to spoilers for no it feels like it could
be an a ufo situation but then it turns out to be a weird
life form that's hiding in the yucca valley in california
inside a cloud that feeds on horses yes well yeah you think it's a
spaceship and it turns out it's an actual physical being right right and
then it tapes takes different shapes and well the reason it's decided as we discovered throughout the movie the
reason it's kind of settled in this valley is because of the stephen young character who's been feeding at horses
it's a side show for his carnival he has a he has like a like a western town and he was a former child star this is where
it gets very unwieldy where it's like all these kind of elements that do have a purpose but it feels like he was
not he was a sitcom when he was a kid with a monkey and the monkey freaked out and killed people like what does that have to do with
anything but it does tie in um in sort of a not very spelled out way but it's like
he thinks when he was a kid on that sitcom he thought he had some sort of connection with the monkey and that's why the monkey didn't kill him turns out
the monkey didn't kill him because he didn't look it in the eyes and that plays in with the alien ship so he thinks he has some sort
of connection with this this alien being yes because he feeds it horses right it
reminds me of grizzly man where it's like grizzly man he thinks he has that connection with the bears it's like no
he doesn't then the bears just eat him it's all it's all fantasy it's all your own imagination right but it's it's so
presented so kind of vaguely where i could see people being like what's the stuff with the monkey you know that was the more interesting
stuff of the movie to me yeah yeah and that like the animalistic behavior of a creature that
that you can't quite control yeah you don't have a personal connection with this thing you just have to learn to
work with it basically or or tame it in a smart way right like a horse like a horse yeah
still kind of wrapping my head around what it might really be about i kind of got the impression it's about like hollywood and
chewing people up and spitting them out because that's kind of literally what the creature does he likes twilight zone
obviously and he has he likes the twilight zone as twists pulling the rug out from under you where
you think it's a ufo but it ends up being an alien and and a different kind of horror and i
think that's what i liked about it was instead of like like us had that
great scene when uh the the evil versions break into
was it uh elizabeth moss yeah her intimidator yeah and they're twins and there's a lot of brutality and
violence and stabbing and this is like all those spectators at the at the ranch
get sucked up into this alien thing and they're all like horrifically being digested in its
esophagus and it's presented in a way where visually you're sort of like what am i looking at what is this yeah but
about the screaming and you can hear it up in the sky and it's disturbing in in a different way than your classic
horror movie but i will agree with you the the leads are sort of
uh a little unfocused yeah like i get what they're doing with this character that
he's just sort of stuck in this situation because the the the horse com the company it's his
father's business it's been in the family for generations that they train these horses for movies
and he's just sort of like stuck there but he's so kind of miserable to watch well he's because he's so grumpy they
counter balance that with the enthusiasm of the sister right the best buy employee guy circuit city
employee guy it was fries fries yeah which i didn't even know was still a company fry's electronics it's mainly out west okay um
he yeah those two counter balance his lack of enthusiasm and daniel kahlulia
is uh traumatized by the death of his father so he's like kind of miserable and he
doesn't know if he wants to do the horse thing anymore because the patriarch of it is dead
yeah there could have been a little kind of spark or change when he discovers this plot of the ufos yeah
which there kind of is but i think a little more enthusiasm from his character a little more like
uh clarity on their plan like i think they wanted to to videotape
it to sell it well that's that's another aspect would i say it seems like it's kind of about hollywood right or it's
like they want to capture it almost like they're paparazzi and then at one point the movie tmz shows up and that's
presented very dramatically which made it funnier it's tmz the guy on the motorcycle the guy in
the motorcycle yeah i was trying to get pictures of it yeah so it kind of becomes like about celebrity and then you have stephen young's character who
was a child star so that's and obviously they're training horses for movies so there's
that whole hollywood aspect to it but it doesn't feel as as sort of clear as the other movies in terms of
that kind of social political angle um i kind of like that like very slow
sense of discovery of what's happening and them kind of having to fly by the seat of their pants it reminds me of tremors a little bit right i got that
same vibe yeah or it's like they're always trying to stay one step ahead of the threat and they're kind of making it
up as they go along but then you have also kind of what i say m night shyamalan feels like a character right
out of one of his movies is the cinematographer guy um who's so odd and like his dialogue is
weird his performance is weird it was nice to see her that's uh the actor's name is michael wincott he's the main villain in the crow
way back when and says like oh he's a good actor and i haven't seen him in anything in a while but yeah he's just such a bizarre
character very unrealistic and i don't mean that in a bad way like just very off everything feels off one
technical aspect i wanted to bring up very clearly day for night not the worst day for night but i
noticed i think it's the first time uh daniel kahlul is outside at night and there's like a
hard shadow from his hat going on to his face i was like that wouldn't be there a night this is day for night
it's not the worst i've ever seen but still don't do it
would you like to hear what some people who didn't like it thought i i
would love to right from the start daniel calla louie's character doesn't feel serious
you can tell me if you agree with some of these or not doesn't seem serious do they mean as far as his performance or
the character doesn't take the situation seriously like he doesn't really want to do the part oh well that's his character
though the dialogue seems disconnected decision making is totally out the window
if there even is any i see the absurdity and the parody of a
western but nothing makes any sense i had high hopes but the movie
had one thing right when i was done watching it my first comment was
no thanks that was one thing i did read before i don't remember where i saw it but before the movie came out were people because i
guess the trailer alludes that it's aliens and so people were trying to figure out if nope was like an acronym for
something and so i thought that was kind of funny in the movie when it's not it's just the main character they don't see
not of planet earth but is that what it's implied because it's just at a certain point the main characters go nope he's like i'm going to go back
inside not of planet earth okay but i don't know if that's just some speculation or
if it's actually intel well then i guess the title works both ways because yeah in the movie it's just literally what the character says half star nope
big note instead of a horror sci-fi i got to endure two hours of cringe
where's the plot where's the background story nice character arc from a sulking
cap wearing broken-hearted to almost spatial lone ranger
without as much as buy your leave did they have a stroke while writing
that part of his negative critique is that he
was wearing a baseball hat boring not scary exploitation of a real violent
incident nope don't go what's the real violence do they think the monkey situation really happened
what the [ __ ] did i just watch why do people think this is remotely good someone please explain how a cloud
is supposed to be scary
did they stop watching before they realized that it wasn't a cloud half
wanky self-involved hollywood self-hand job of a movie
cheesy tarantino clone to the end what boring to a t
the title and all nope memes in this movie just show how shallow the movie is
my favorite bad reviews are the ones where you don't even you can't even comprehend what they're trying to mean i
would be more challenged reading the back of a toilet door
like a stall of a public bathroom i guess that's a toilet door
yeah and normally when i read the bad reviews it's laughable because you know you watch a really good film and then
someone just just doesn't get it yeah and this i have a i have a mild bit of sympathy
for the people that were frustrated because they want that they want stabs and they want jump
scares well you want the house of mirrors you want that satisfying conclusion like get out has like get
out's a crowd pleaser and this movie is is slower
it's a little more abstract and weird i mean just the bit with uh
uh steven young's character when he's the kid and he's hiding under the table and he's looking out and there's that shoe
that's just it's like an anomaly it's just standing straight up yeah yeah yeah that was weird and well that's the thing is like
i could see people being like what is that what's the point of that i think the idea is that it is an anomaly it makes no sense but it's so weird that it
distracts him so he's not looking the monkey in the eye and that's why the monkey doesn't kill him but he's like uh
idolized to this thing now he's got that shoe in like a glass case and it's like he's completely oblivious
to the fact that that shoe basically saved his life because it prevented him from looking the monkey in the eye and if he did the monkey would have killed
him and it's just such a weird like roundabout way of of explaining what's happening in the
movie or it doesn't really explain it that's the thing it's all very understated so this doesn't have the the
clarity of uh get out and it doesn't have the kind of
visual creepiness of us no it's it's a it's a slow burn it's a like a discovery
and then when you get to the alien creature at the end it doesn't look like a xenomorph it's very
abstract and weird it looks like a giant balloon that's what i liked is that it's legitimately alien looking it's not you
can't comprehend its anatomy at all that's not what roland and rick would come up with exactly it's like the opposite of uh of a big kind of alien
invasion blockbuster movie but but the idea the the theme that
uh hollywood or the sh or show business uh because there's a lot of that when
they take the horse to the set and they got the old lady who's the old star and the horse like
goes a little crazy and then he keeps saying don't look in the eye and that ties in with the aliens
yeah and then they replace it with cgi thing that they could sit on
the idea that it sucks you up and spits you out leaves nothing left
i think is a little too specific for general audiences i'm sure a lot that's probably why it got great reviews
good reviews um because a lot of the critics probably got it more than your
average moviegoer who wants to see some kind of bloody scary nightmare or movie yeah
when it's just like bright daylight and there there's a weird thing flying around the clouds and it's more
metaphorical and less like visual and visceral and violent
you'll be getting a call from my supervisor asking how my service was five stars angel five stars
so mike uh would you recommend nope i guess we didn't do a recommendation
for spin me around both these movies i think we would both recommend absolutely absolutely uh i i
i enjoyed nope in the way we just discussed uh and then spin me around also same thing
i have a very particular taste of uh sarcastic dry
nihilistic misanthropic just just uh oh
uh i hate everyone i hate human beings and what they are
capable of and i just love laughing in my sick
twisted way it's not a funny rom-com you're not gonna laugh
how funny is it that they go out to the italian restaurant and alison
can't read the italian menu isn't that funny
do you think that poster would be confusing to people it seems so intentional so over the top that i think
people would get it but who knows it reminds me of the uh uh criterion cover for uh polyester john
waters polyester is that similar kind of poking fun at melodramatic romantic uh
cover art uh the word you're looking for is harlequin harlequin romance sure yes
yes so they're making fun at the because that's her vision of what's gonna happen in in in italy when she goes and she
gets a dose of reality with a with a twist of crazy idiot
so i'll recommend both uh it's slim pickings out there in the in the streaming world it's true
we talked a lot about movies today he just wants to go take a nap it's time
for my nap
