MIKE:
Hey, everybody.
It's Mike and J from Red Letter Media.
Just an update to let you know that we're going to be at this year's Chicago Comic Con August 11th through the 14th.
This is at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont, Illinois.

JAY:
Yeah.
We're gonna have a booth there, selling DVDs of our horrible film Feeding Frenzy, along with, uh, posters, and we're probably going to be running around filming stuff for the website.
So if you see us, uh, stop by and say hi.

MIKE:
Sure.
We're gonna be at booth 647B.
Um, which, if you don't know where that's at, it's going to be located near the Batmobile and the DeLorean.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But our booth will be located nowhere near Billy Corgan's booth.

JAY:
No.

JAY:
The former lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins will be at the Chicago Comic Con this year.

JAY:
Why is he gonna be there?

MIKE:
I don't know.
So he's gonna be there.
Also, I read this morning that some of the actors from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory...

JAY:
It's gonna be a reunion, yeah.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
All the kids are back together.

MIKE:
And the, the irony is that that, um, Violet Beauregarde really is that fat now.
"Violet, you're turning violet, Violet!"
"Take the young lady to the squeezing room."
"The squeezing room?"
"Yes."
"She's filled with juice."
"She has to be squeezed or else she'll explode."
"Explode?"

JAY:
So, if we didn't have a booth that one of these conventions, would you ever go just as, uh, just as an attendant?

MIKE:
Oh, no.
Only the most pathetic losers go to Comic-Con.

PLINKETT:
Hey, guys.
Guess where I'm going?
To the doctor's office.
Because I've got cancer.
