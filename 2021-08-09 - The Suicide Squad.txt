["Half in the Bag."]
Jay: Oh, goddammit.
Mike: We're almost out of Germ-X. What are we gonna do?
Jay: I can't believe the CDC says we have to go back to wearing masks indoor, even if we're vaccinated.
Mike: Yep. We're back to this shit again. I call it "deja flu." That's right. I just coined that term. And don't you try to use it, major cable news outlets. I'm watching ya. And so is my lawyers!
Jay: Who are you talking to? Ah, whatever. But you're vaccinated, right?
Mike: Fuck yeah.
Jay: Yeah, me too. And with the real deal. Not the fake shit you were trying to sell at your fraudulent pop-up vaccination clinic
i'll admit jay that wasn't my best scam but how was i supposed to know that vaccines were free i mean at that point i had 20,000 fake doses and a line of people around the block what was i supposed to do
maybe tell people just to go home
i'm sure all those people that i injected with a placebo are doing just fine jay. but let's not lose sight of what's the most important thing: us.
that's right mike. it just sucks that i finally got used to not wearing a mask and now i have to wear one again
well that's not entirely true some places now require masks again if you're vaccinated and some don't some require masks only if you're unvaccinated while some require just
half of a mask if you've only received one shot
which half
the left half
so uh what if i'm in like target do i have to wear a mask there
well it depends
on what
on where the target's located and what your county's current risk assessment level is also known as RAL.
huh
here take a look at this handy interactive map this might help
oh god no 
light orange levels 1 a and b do not require masks inside retail establishments with the subcategories a b and c. category d are bars and restaurants. they do require masks when walking inside and to your table but when at your table you're free to remove your mask while eating drinking and coughing on the people that you're with. medium orange color levels 3a and 3b to light red colors 3a to 3c do not require masks and retail establishments in categories a b and c but do require them in categories d
and what are categories a b and c again
category a are outdoor events: concerts beaches kite flying competitions
what
outdoor dining where the tables are at least 6.3 feet apart
what
category b are larger retail outlets like big box chains targets walmarts grocery stores etc but only if the store is at least 20,000 square feet. if it falls below that then it's in a category in between b and c called b 1.6 consult your local store directory on the store square footage. category c is just indoor skydiving. nobody really knows what to do with that.
so let's say i'm in a mild risk zone say dark orange to light red i'm wearing a mask and i want to go into a place that's in the category of b1.6
well it depends on the state the county the type
of mask you're wearing and the current status of the legal action against the regulations
wait type of mask well i usually just wear my trusty old blue surgical mask that's falling off my face that i can easily breathe through
oh silly jay. light blue surgery masks are so first half of 2021. they don't protect against any of the new variants.
what do you mean new variants
oh yeah the delta variant is 10 times more contagious than regular covid. and delta plus, a hundred times more contagious than the delta variant.
but what about the delta burke variant
and don't even get me started on the lambda variant
i'm never going into t-target again
so what happened to the variance of beta, gamma
oh those are all out there too. and they've all mutated into their own plus variants
i have covid
what kind of covid
all the covids
regular
yes
delta
yeah
delta plus
yes
epsilon zeta
yes
not...omega?
yes i tested positive for all of the variants that's what the medical professional said at the piggly wiggly
uh well i mean you were vaccinated right
what oh i don't believe in the covet vaccine but i have been vaccinated for measles mumps rubella shingles
jay if this is true and mr plinkett does have all the covet variants his body will most likely mutate them into the most dangerous variant of them all: the omega plus plus plus variant
it's resistant to any known vaccine and is 100 billion times more contagious than any disease ever known to mankind
where did you get this information
buzzfeed
well i'm off to a crowded concert venue where nobody is wearing masks
hold it right there you prick
should we just shoot him
no if he survives his body will produce antibodies which will be very useful to scientists. and by very useful i mean we can sell them to scientists.
oh, right
don't shoot don't shoot i've got so many year to live
jay, go get the duct tape. and as for you sit down in your fucking wheelchair you prick mother fucker.
look, i don't know who you are but this might be my only chance to see bts, exo, got7, monsta x, tvxq, and nctu all on one big stage and i'm not going to miss it
what the hell is all that. are those some kind of new covet variants
no. it's k-pop. it's it's kind of my new thing.
k-pop. what the fuck is k-pop. what? come here you prick.
oh
you get in your fucking wheelchair
i'm not getting in no fucking wheelchair oh, ow, oh
you son of a bitch
oh, my god. i'm surprisingly spry for a man with all of the covid
oh stop it stop it right now god dammit
i'm gonna hit you with the tv unless you get in the fucking wheelchair
look out
come here, you!
stop it, stop it right now, goddammit
great now we just wait for him to get
really sick
recover and then we can sell his
antibodies to joe biden
mike he's 117 years old do you really
think he's gonna recover from the most
deadly
uh what am i doing what does it matter
i can't believe this is my life
there really is only one solution
no wait
speaking of suicide
have you seen space jam a new legacy
those tickets were non-refundable you'll
pay for this you prick
[Music]
robert dubois he's in prison for putting
superman in the icu with a kryptonite
bullet the suicide squad is back
in the world's shortest wait time
between a franchise reboot or is it
actually a sequel either way this
suicide squad doesn't feel like it was
edited by an algorithm that's on the
fritz harley quinn's back
some guy named rick flags back
and james gunn is back after being
twitter cancelled i might dispute your
your accusation that this is the world's
fastest reboot uh the
andrew garfield spider-man into
the
uh what's that little kid's name
tom holland spider-man yeah wasn't that
like 18-20
like wasn't that like
17-18
with andrew garfield and then
2019 wasn't it like a year later or like
a week later i don't know we'll have to
do some some calculations and some deep
diving and we'll put the results here
the time between
uh amazing spider-man 2 and
spider-man homecoming right it's
probably comparable to this
the bigger question is how pissed off is
david air right now oh oh i think he's
probably a little annoyed
studio took his movie warner brothers
took his movie and just shoved it into a
blender in an attempt to please
nobody they also shoved it into a
blemmer a blemmer at a rich evans moment
that's worse than a blender uh and then
he sees this and it's like oh they let
james gunn just make a james gun movie
with
seemingly no interference or if there is
any it's very minor yeah well that was
uh a a trending twitter thing released
the air cut following the success
yeah
admitted success i enjoyed the snyder
cut much much much
more than the studio butcher job
uh and then david ayer had a statement
where he's like i wrote a film with
intriguing depthful characters with
amazing arcs and thoughtful this and
that and blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah
i think at the very least the air cut
would be better than the theatrical cut
even if it's not very good maybe maybe
it's okay i don't know but i'm not a
huge fan of his
i like the movie with the tank in it
and oh yeah the brad pitt movie yeah
that was good um
but i did not like the movie with the
cops in it
i didn't know anything about david ayer
so i was surprised to read his like kind
of rough backstory and upbringing and uh
but uh
uh this original suicide squad
uh
not so good
uh james gunn a better fit yes and we'll
discuss that now
on our program
my vcr almost fixed i don't have a lot
to say about this it's very james gunn
it does feel like the studio kind of
left him alone it feels very different i
mean compare this to some of the recent
marvel movies this is miles better i
never thought we'd get to that point
this is like the suicide squad is
interesting because uh
it is it is a whole different kind of
tonal
uh nightmare that you have to have all
the
all these well-balanced ingredients put
into it in the right amounts in order to
make it work yeah i mean you got you got
something like the avengers right
superheroes and they're all they all got
their own thing but they're all
generally good superheroes and you can
throw some light humor in there kind of
poke fun at it but also take it
seriously and then the marvel's found
that formula pretty well dc has
struggled
that's the nicest possible way to put it
yeah they went for the more darker route
um
[Music]
and
that's
something like i just didn't like about
that original suicide squad movie i
think it just took itself too seriously
it was yeah it was weird and it also
didn't really live up to the concept the
whole idea of the suicide squad is
they're a group of basically expendable
like thugs and lowlifes that they're
just taken advantage of and put into
these situations because if they die it
doesn't really matter with superpowers
with superpowers
yeah um and that first movie none of
them really had superpowers in that
first movie did they there was the guy
who looked like a crocodile that was
kind of it but they're all it's like i
remember that was my big complaint about
that movie it was like what's harley
quinn with a bat gonna do against these
supernatural beings there's like a witch
lady at the end of that movie
and this movie is a better fit of like
this is the type of mission you send
these types of characters on right
everything about the concept works so
much better in this movie than in the
last one when you throw these comic book
characters into something like the
suicide squad the david air one and
david ayer obviously
you know he did end of watch and the
tank movie and other things and he's a
little darker yeah he's not goofy yes
and that's probably why all the
characters in that one didn't have
wacky superpowers he didn't want to get
too goofy or weird he didn't want to use
polka dot man
and and this kind of subject matter
needs polka dot man yes well the nice
thing about and i think it works better
in this i like the guardians movies more
in general but this movie finds a better
balance of
yes there's goofy [ __ ] like polka dot
man but
polka dot man himself isn't a joke
the movie never goes like and that's
something about the marvel formula that
started to wear on me is there's always
that winking like uh i can't believe we
got a big green monster working for us
there's like wink in it like we know
this is silly to the audience
and this is more of like it's just
embracing the weirdness of these
characters
i mean that's james gunn's strength is
just sort of taking the character
seriously and he does that even with the
most bizarre of characters yes and he
balances that really well in this i
think yes that was one of the
ingredients for this movie i watching
this it felt like i was watching a big
double triple issue comic book of this
big storyline right it didn't it felt
more like a
a weird
comic book story line than it did a
movie
and i enjoyed that and i was like and
and like you said it took the character
seriously because people who wrote those
comic books with these bizarre
characters
weren't just it wasn't like a gag it was
they were taking it seriously to a
degree and that's that's the magic is
like
you gotta you gotta
one they're all bad guys right
so they all have their own issues
they've committed crimes or whatever
they're not necessarily like psychopaths
or like awful people but except for the
weasel except for the weasel yeah
he's not a werewolf okay he's a weasel
he's harmless i mean he's not harmless
he's killed 27 children but you know we
got him to i think he's agreed to do
this you have to make them likable
right you have to give them all their
their proper screen time and backstory
which was accomplished yes and you have
to have a
a interesting storyline with some nice
twists and turns that doesn't devolve i
mean this did devolve into them fighting
a big bad guy at the end but it didn't
feel like
a villain of the week there's nothing
generic
i couldn't remember anything about
suicide squad so i went back and i
scrubbed through it
and i got to the end and they were
fighting somebody like who looked just
like steppenwolf it was a monster i just
remember the witch lady there was a
witch lady i saw the witch lady and i
thought she was a part of the team she
was and then she turned bad okay and
then i get to the end and there's like a
monster
in that that
steppenwolf armor and everybody's
fighting him and i was like
i will
never remember that
but i will always remember a giant
intergalactic starfish yes smashing up a
a small town who emits tiny starfish
from his armpit right yeah um and so
that
that was
just this
bizarro
twist and and that is probably
a real
uh comic book villain or storyline same
with all the sub characters i was
wondering about that because we're gonna
get we recommend this movie i guess
before we start talking about spoilers
yeah we would both recommend it it's a
lot of fun
spoilers
[Music]
that's what you guys do all day
[Music]
uh the opening of the movie the first
15-20 minutes is a giant misdirect
all these characters that we are
introduced to that are actually built up
better than characters that last entire
movies in some of these types of movies
uh
they all get killed they're the
diversion and then we follow the real
team
so i was wondering like if comic book
fans would be pissed are these real
characters that they're killing off is
anyone going to be mad about this i
don't know it works in surface of the
story
it it goes on a on a gradient jay people
get mad about the you know they
destroyed the
the character from black widow
uh oh uh
i've already forgotten because that
movie was so generous
it was a guy who could mimic anyone's
fighting style
um and then this movie it's just generic
character in suit that turns out to be a
lady yeah yeah yeah who did some of the
mimicking qualities of that character
but it was a gender swap so yeah you
know
i guess everyone was angry about that
who was angry and who holds that
character in such high regard
and why
yeah but no
i i googled uh polka dot man yes real
character okay and and it's interesting
because i wanted to bring this up very
quickly
um i don't i don't listen to podcasts a
lot but
i was uh listening to the npr podcast
planet money right
and there's a kind of a famous series of
i think there's three parts to it or
maybe two parts uh it's called planet
money buys a superhero
and it was there they started off the
podcast with this mission to
purchase they had they said we have a
briefcase full of ten thousand dollars
and we're going to purchase a superhero
from marvel
and because like the rights to the
rights to it yes they wanted to see if
they could and marvel has uh in their
vaults
underground and a bomb shelter they have
the rights to over 7 000 superhero
characters there are superhero
characters that go back to the golden
age of comics when they just were
cranking them out sure superheroes
everywhere uh only one percent of them
became iconic spider-man's thor's
captain america hulks whatever yeah
batman's i want to leave out the dc
worse
batman superman's batmite of course
who's that he's a little like flying
batman
looks like a little bug
well that's my point
there's a ton of those yeah and um so
they did some they attempted to contact
marvel and everything just failed okay
and you know the comic book expert guy
comes in and he's like he's like yeah
they're never gonna sell you anything
because something like groot a rare
obscure character became a merchandising
explosion
it's funny i look at him you know what i
see
dolls with suction cups staring out car
windows so they've got them all tucked
away in their back pocket you never know
when you're going to need one so there's
you know polka dot man right it's in
their archive
um and
so this the planet money guys went and
they did some more research and they
discovered
uh early on in the 1940s during the big
comic book boom the
copyright laws were different and a lot
of characters around that time the
copyright law only went for 28 years
so characters created in the 40s and 50s
the copyright would have expired in the
70s
and a lot of these places didn't renew
the copyright contracts so they picked
out
a random comic book character called
microface
a a superhero with a a a face with a
microphone mouth
microphone like shoot sound waves out of
his mouth when he said microface i was
thinking of the villain from dick tracy
with the tiny face no no um
and so they're like it was in the public
domain all these comic book characters
had fallen off into the public domain
yeah and so uh
they're just like well okay let's take
microface and we're gonna just take it
because you could yeah and so they they
planet money took this character named
microface and they hired an artist they
got the blessing from the the daughter
of the original creator and they made
the comic book they have a t-shirt and
it's become like the the this like logo
for them huh um so it's interesting
there are
pro there's probably
you know a well of characters that goes
10 miles deep
all stored somewhere and i think
i don't know part of me thinks if this
movie is really popular and successful
that could be kind of like
a continue a new phase
that comic books can go into because
what what we're getting another [ __ ]
batman with robert pattinson now yeah
another spider-man movie
yeah and then it's like um
i'm so much more excited about polka dot
man it's just a rash
that's a rash he his mother he had an
oppressive mother who was a scientist
who injected all of her children with
the space virus
and every day he has to spew out
colorful polka dots out of his face his
face swells up
it's like body horror when his face was
swelling up and glowing and his polka
dots he shoots with like melted people
yeah and then he was like depressed and
he just wanted to die yeah that's so
much more it's refreshing to see
something so different like when you
just see
batman over and [ __ ] over exactly and
that's the magic of the suicide squad i
think in in
uh future films is is
keep digging up all these obscure
characters yeah uh viola davis has
prisons everywhere i guess that have
captured all these these obscure
villainous characters and she can just
continue to use them yeah and maybe not
her anymore maybe the the lady who hit
her with a golf club
is going to take over now we're going to
have a more
a more sensitive suicide side squad
leadership oh it was a little more uh a
little less she was really intense in
this movie way so more so than what i
remember from the last movie they made
her uh wrapped up in her job yeah they
made her like a full-blown villain
yeah and that that was another magical
thing with this movie was that it wasn't
very um like nihilistic or dark or no
you know and
you
you the these were the most
superhero-ish characters
that i've seen in a while a tortured
multifaceted
questionably ethical character is always
more dynamic and depthful than a
superman that's true or a captain
america
they tried to implement some some of
that
uh drama
with the the civil war
whether or not he him and tony stark
disagreed and
you know
it's fine i like that stuff certain
degree but
um it's just at this point in the
endless cycle of comic book movies
that's tired i'm done with that black
widow was like i am done with this [ __ ]
that was some kind of it just feels so
stale at this point it feels like a fork
in the road yeah this suicide squad
movie feels like some kind of shift at
least for me for my own personal tastes
i i enjoyed it um
i enjoyed the creativity uh i i i didn't
find it as like funny
as as other james gunn stuff yeah i mean
i think he was going for that
intentionally it's not as jokey as the
guardian right and that's which is fine
yeah it's it's interesting because this
james gunn
came from marvel over to dc
after he he got canceled for something i
don't even know what he got canceled for
10 year old offensive jokes for being
james gunn it was funny because when
that was all happening and people were
like look at these horrible like he's
making jokes about child molestation and
blah blah blah i was like man i've been
following this guy's [ __ ] career
since he worked for troma this is not
shocking in the least right but all
these people that only know him for
marvel movies are like what is this
and there's a political angle to it too
of course which we don't have to go into
all that but yeah he was kind of a
blabbermouth about politics on twitter
so people wanted to shut them up about
that and it became a whole thing
so you dig up dig up the old tweets that
old playbook but yeah so he he moved
from marvel to dc and then
the dc fan base seems to like the
the darker more serious stuff so they
probably said hey
when you write your script
make it make it funny but don't make it
too funny i mean it's it's funny without
trying to be funny a lot of the times
like the idea of polka dot man like it's
such an absurd concept that you play it
straight and that makes it almost
funnier but it's interesting because
this yeah this feels like they mostly
left him alone and it's rated r which i
was excited about because i like james
gunn's earlier stuff and this is like
the kind of movie he would be making
even if it wasn't attached to a billion
dollar ip
it just feels like a james gun movie
yeah which is great that he's managed to
i mean i know he wrote those scooby-doo
movies but you know you got to pay the
bills somehow but all the stuff he's
like written and directed himself like
you can see a through line from those
early like trauma stuff to this
where it's like man being able to
navigate that in like hollywood and do
these big movies and still have a voice
shine through is pretty amazing yeah
yeah just like the lady that directed
black widow
i guess it helps that james gunn has a
goofy style to begin with
and he was writing comic book [ __ ]
before the marvel
cycle even started he wrote a movie this
reminded me a lot of he wrote a movie he
didn't direct it but he wrote a movie
called the specials which is about like
the sixth or seventh most popular
superhero team and it just takes place
in this house where they all live and
they're just like arguing all the time
unfortunately the same chemicals that
gave him the superpowers gave him a type
of mouth cancer and he was
dead in six months same thing happened
to captain elastic flagpole lad gooey
stan
like a holocaust of rubbery people it's
not a great movie it's not very well
directed but yeah this reminded me of
that too
so it's like you know and then super of
course with rayne wilson like right
right which i guess we're in spoilers we
can talk about this uh pete davidson
shows up at the beginning of this movie
and we were like oh
but then it's so [ __ ] satisfying when
his face gets blown off
spoilers and it happens exactly like uh
at the end of super elliot page's face
gets blown off right it's like the exact
same visual
there's that one shot where the
starfish buzz pulled the person's face
off yeah that's pretty grotesque
grotesque without being gratuitous the
gore in this it has these like moments
just these like you know it's almost
like the
what do they call that the splash page
in a comic book panel where you have the
big action moment it does that with gore
in this but it's never like too
gratuitous
this is boring
god this is so boring
[Applause]
it feels like it earns that ending a big
monster destroying the city andy and it
felt so old-fashioned yeah cause there
aren't any giant
set pieces
no it's all very there's the part when
they
are trying to rescue
joel kinnaman which is kind of a
misdirect
it turns out that those were the good
guys so they just [ __ ] murdered them
all
uh harley quinn breaking out of the
prison i thought was really well
executed yeah that was a fun sequence
there's something about the camera work
and i'm not sure how to how to like
describe it properly where it was like
really
jerky but controlled where it would be
like it would swish around and then it
would feel like it stopped suddenly
and then it would switch around to
another angle and stop suddenly yeah i
don't know how to describe it but it was
very like
intentional
uh it's very stylized in a way where it
wasn't just i don't know i just think of
like those marvel movies and now
it's dictated by the the visual effects
artists and it's like like we talked
about with black widow it's like you
come up with the action scenes first and
work a story around it right here just
this was just a movie that someone wrote
the scripts and they shopped the script
that all the action makes sense within
the story there was action like
you know there's the part where they
obviously the opening is a big action
sequence and then
then there's a lot of character stuff
and then there's the
they kind of there's some like i don't
know gun battle stuff the harley quinn
thing but there's no like gigantic
you know city crushing set piece right
yeah
and
in the old old
school method of movie making
like you said it's earned
that's why it was like
it the ending felt great because
all those characters all these different
team members we learned a lot about them
all their little quirks their powers
their motivations because there's the
john cena character yeah um and the
idris elba character and they're they're
sort of like they're similar but
different you just said each member of
the team has chosen for their unique
abilities he does exactly what i do but
better i always hear my target's dead
center get them more in the center are
you calling something more in a sense i
use smaller bullets what and so it all
comes to like a boiling point and it
becomes this big like
the
well-earned paid off
gigantic monster set piece that
feels so much better than monster with
horns in a suit of armor right who has
shown up three times throughout the film
and done battle with the heroes and then
flown away only to show up at the end
maybe he even has a bigger monster
behind him
[Music]
[Applause]
yeah
so creativity
uh good characterization
um heroic characters uh i'm rooting for
our heroes at the at the end
even though they accidentally murdered
30 people and 30 innocent good guys
at the end it doesn't matter because
they decide to do the right thing even
harley quinn
i and i like i like that the the
nihilism and
gross dark dirty like ill has sucked out
and i i
i felt uh that these were superheroes
because i think that's the final well i
don't want to spoil anything but i think
that's oh we're already in sports the
final line of one of the characters i'll
say that yeah oh yeah yeah this
character yells i'm a superhero gotta go
to the bathroom before something bad
happens
uh and so that that
just worked out so well i i said i gotta
go to the bathroom
never mind
jay let's talk about music okay we're
gonna talk about music
oh my god yeah i mean obviously james
gunn likes music the guardians movies
it's mostly like 70s and 80s kind of
radio hits this is a little more
eccentric yeah yeah yeah so with this
this opens with johnny cash uh you know
the jim carroll band song there's
there's a lot of music there's a pixie
song yeah and yeah obviously james gunn
loves putting music in his films not
just score but pop songs
from all eras that's what guardians is
all about the guardians mixtape music
incredibly effective use and so that
ultimately
made me feel cringy when i when i went
back and looked at
suicide squad oh yeah and it's like well
that movie the first suicide squad movie
is like a new song every five seconds
[Music]
that was they were trying to make the
movie like a trailer it's a misuse of
that wonderful skill yeah um or knowing
what songs to use when to use them yes
and why to use them it just felt like
like like an algorithm plugged it in and
said this we have the rights to the song
for this long and it just didn't feel
right it was just music shoved into like
because you remember the song
it was like what are those those cds
like wow this is music that's what now
that's what i call that that's what i
call music 238
they just grabbed a couple of those off
the shelf and then threw them into the
editing bay and it's not like there were
contemporary songs or what was popular
on the radio at the time the movie came
out i mean obviously queen's that song's
old but
it was it just felt
more calculated and corporatey and less
like organic and soulful like james gunn
feels like oh this song would work
perfect in this sequence yeah and and it
feels like someone picked that
that
melding i remember we noted
i think we noted this in our half in the
bag review and others obviously picked
up on this too but the when suicide
squad the 2016 one
first started
releasing trailers and advertising stuff
the logo progressively got more powerful
yeah yeah yeah over time and i think we
did a
comparison
and and it kind of felt like by the end
of that they were like
oh god you know
this should be
more like a marvel thing
and we got this david ayer guy
who
you know is standing around like
he's probably smoking
going
[Music]
life is miserable and we're oh god we
should have got james gunn i want to use
nothing but public enemy songs right
in our comic book movie
[ __ ] the police
and then they're like oh well just shove
a queen in there in the beginning
and it'll make it work
it'll make it poppy
add more color to the logo and you just
got that creepy like cringy
vibe that the studio is trying to change
that into something else yeah which you
can't do with a movie that's already
been shot and designed to be one thing
you can try well the the result is the
suit is the first suicide squad movie
we've seen what happens it's just like
what are you doing
well how could how could everybody drop
the ball so badly yeah like you hire you
hire david ayer you're going to get a
product
it's it's weird though like dc keeps
trying to change the types of movies
they were doing at the time they hired
him that was when they were still like
knee-deep in the zack snydery dark uh
gritty taking it there so that's kind of
what they wanted and then when those
movies weren't you know connecting with
people the way they hoped that they
would
then it's like oh there's guardians of
the galaxy are popular so let's rechange
the movie that's already been shot to
make it more like that
dc was like constantly trying
to change courses in the middle of
production of things
and now it seems like they're more kind
of leaning towards just like leaving the
filmmakers alone
because like the shazam movie like that
you know the
david sandberg movie just feels like a
david sandberg movie joker joker of
course um and then this so doom patrol
which is a show i haven't watched like
any of the other crap from dc i was like
oh sure
teen titans like live action i'm like
bat bat woman or uh yeah there's a bunch
of shows i've watched doom patrol duke
patrol's really good um
and it's also kind of misfitting obscure
characters uh so
i don't know i think that's i mean if
that's the route they want to take now
like less of trying to capture the
marvel cinematic universe stuff and just
making individual movies that are all
their own kind of distinct thing yeah i
think that's the way to go and that's
the way to be distinct from marvel and
not just constantly fall on your face
yeah dc was trying to do the marvel
thing like at the end of suicide squad
there's that trailer
it's funny i wonder if you could add up
how many like post-credit trailer things
just never turned into anything
just like batman
bruce wayne
ben affleck batman not to be confused
with 26 other batman uh he he meets with
viola davis and he's like give me the
files on all the people that will become
the justice league
my friends and i will do it for you
and then there's what movie has the the
ending with like
lex luthor and uh dead
deadshot uh oh that was the end of
justice league is that justice league
yeah okay
with joe
shot eye eye shot
bullseye eyeball bull shot
shot bull shotgun
shot by shot dead eye shot earshot
deadshot this goes back to what you're
saying about the all the old characters
that have been ignored or forgotten
about you just described half of them
the monocle
that's like the world's first superhero
the monocle the monocle he's just like
an old-timey guy and he's got a like
like a monocle from the future oh back
when they thought monocles would be like
consistent throughout time
and he has a monocle from the year
1996.
oh wow and uh he's flying around and
running around the 1800s or 1700s with a
monocle and and it has like supersite on
it can it see the future
yeah it has multiple settings on it oh
okay you can see the future but only 10
seconds into the future
it's meant for watching theater plays
if you if you've missed
a minute into the future
because if you had to if you had to go
use the gentleman's lounge oh sure uh uh
the outhouse
uh during the theatrical play you can
you can watch the the last two minutes
while you were you were in the
gentleman's lounge man abe lincoln
really would have benefited from that i
know he left his monocle at home monaco
man was a little too late
um but he had the monocle on and
he has like a civil war rifle like one
of those like muskets that had horrible
accuracy
and uh and and the monocle helps him
my monocle is telling me to aim my my
powder gunpowder musket
17 feet to the left
but my target is 17 feet to the right
trust the monocle it's from the year
1996 the future
he fires and then pan over and he skis
killed the bad guy
monaco man
oh it's a projectile too
yeah a little
bit
blades
i guess it comes back to them like
captain america or whatever
i'm boring captain boomerang captain
boomerang uh his name captain boomerang
i think so i don't think so
it doesn't matter he's [ __ ] dead he's
dead
uh what was i going on what was i
talking about i don't know anymore we're
talking about monocle man
you remember night court
i just wanted to watch nine court just
shut up
we're trying to talk about a comic book
movie over here i hear night cards
coming back
but it's probably gonna be woke
but the standalone stuff shazam was was
was great that was so much fun
uh joker good in its own way
i like doom patrol a lot there's no
action in doom patrol ever it's just
[ __ ] miserable weird
characters
and it's all just
developing their characters throughout
the whole show very little action almost
none
bizarro deep
bottom of the drawer
uh superhero characters and i think to
me
that that is a much more
palatable and interesting direction for
me sure those those types of stories i i
really like that even if
like polka dot man right i'm gonna take
a wild stab in the dark here polka dot
man probably wasn't a character in the
comic books when he was originally
created probably wasn't depressed and
suicidal and hated his mother sure
maybe not but you can take an old old
property like polka dot man and give
them some kind of depth full
weird angle and make it super
interesting yeah and that's the kind of
stuff that i prefer um
well that's what james gunn did with the
guardians of the galaxy that wasn't a
popular now everybody loves it but it
wasn't a popular comic those characters
weren't popular and and and i think this
is very much exemplified in the fact
that marvel
phase four or five whatever we're on
which is sort of like a movie hero there
mixed with tv shows
i haven't tuned into loki
haven't tuned into
falcon and the winter soldier
i did watch
the
division juan division which was an
interesting take until it turned into a
marvel movie at the end yeah um but that
that felt i mean it has the connections
to the overall
cinematic universe but it still was
telling its own story it was about grief
it was about something yes um yes so it
still kind of felt isolated 80 of it was
very good yeah that felt like a good
step in the right direction uh
but it still was tied to that universe
and they're never gonna
branch off wildly because they're their
cinematic universe has been way too
successful yeah and and it's the it's
like star wars where you've got that
ingrained fan base that just won't budge
yeah and they'll watch
winter soldier and falcon and loki and
you can make you know a show about any
character and they'll watch it
i just i i think i'm just burnt out on
those characters i think i want new
characters so i think that's what was so
pleasant
and refreshing with this uh james gunn
movie was that characters that have have
new directions to go and grow as
characters right because marvel they're
introducing shang chi and the eternals
and it all just feels like like a
variation on the same formula as opposed
to just like doing something wildly
different yeah which which would be
financially too risky for them dc's in a
place where they might as well try
different things the expression uh
what is it don't don't get off a winning
horse or something like that right
there's you know there's horse like
don't don't uh look a gift horse in the
mouth but but i think there's like don't
don't get off a winning horse like yeah
you're
the kentucky derby and the horse is
doing great
and then if you're crossing the stream
with your horse and it's doing just fine
don't change horses midstream uh that's
the marvel edict now i'm sure it's like
oh we've got all this all this we've
established our universe it's
set in stone and now we can just and it
was interesting and exciting to watch as
it was building and happening but as
we've said after the avengers it's like
okay we're done now i want something
different
[Music]
my vcr almost fixed
do you remember that
do you remember that story when that was
a thing
oh god
i'm starting to feel a little bit warm
