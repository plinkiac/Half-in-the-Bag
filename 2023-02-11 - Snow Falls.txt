half in the bag all right you guys have fun
well Mike it's official we've reached the bottom of the barrel
we might be below the bottom of the barrel I don't even know what this show is anymore show last episode we watched
we just watched an episode of Night Court and now here we are how did we get here
we got here because so far 2023 has been just awful I don't even think I've
watched a movie has a new movie out it was the number
one movie over the weekend I didn't even know it existed until yesterday me neither
and then uh something else came out Ant-Man and The Wasp that's not out yet oh it's already the biggest movie of all
time though okay uh what else came out
so we should point out though because this is every year people say are you gonna make we used to do a thing called
Fu it's January we've got to be careful with YouTube now YouTube won't let us swear anymore we can't say
foreign well the thing is we stopped kind of doing that because that years ago that
stopped being the model it used to be January was the month that Studios dumped their crappy movies into the
theaters into theaters now even before like the pandemic stuff that kind of stopped being the model now they dumped
their crap all year all year into the theaters but yeah no but some good movies have
been released in January it's not really the business model anymore so that's that's why we don't do that anymore uh
but this is sort of the spiritual successor to those videos right because there's been lots of crap released this
year that nobody's ever heard of yes and and this is our official first video of
what crap came out this year so far and we had a little system of uh of
determining that because you know movies come out all the time I say oh yeah that looks like a cool movie and it came out six months
ago never heard of it is it just release dates mean nothing and and garbage
movies come out all the time you go to Toby oh tuby's got the best garbage and you
find just atrocious things so I I drew the line at what is listed on imdb.com
as an official 2023 release okay and I had a very simple method I sorted the
movies uh by rankings review rankings user ratings right user ratings from
worst up and uh and then I watched the trailers for every awfully reviewed
movie and I had a specific criteria for the trailer which which uh
it's does it open with a drone shot of a car driving down a lonely Highway
this came for me today oh that's a little long we'll call it opens with a
drone shot that was the criteria and I found five movies that qualified because uh it's no
longer impressive that you have a drone no and it's no longer impressive that you have drone shots that simulate old
school Hollywood helicopter shots or crane shots Dolly shots whatever you want to call them it's not impressive
anymore because that they do that to hook you in oh it's a real movie look at that that wide overhead shot it's just
like The Shining what up oh what do you think is up with Carla
come on then you see the first like couple scenes and then
ironically snow falls the movie we're going to talk about in depth has the opposite problem all these other ones
you see the Drone shot and it looks semi-professional and then it cuts to the regular shots from the movies and they look awful this uh snowfall the
Drone shots look like super low res compared to the rest of the footage when they first show up at the cabin there's
like a drone shot coming down to the front door of the house and it's like horribly compressed and it looks like
digitally sharpened or something and it looks awful and then it cuts to a regular shot from the movie and it looks
pretty good and then you might want to sit down for this but the the films that made our list
thank you I just want to kill myself oh oh did you say something no I didn't say anything
did you hear what I said no uh well snow falls that's the movie that
we picked at random selected from a hat uh the devil beneath
uh and here's their drone shots playing under my explanations yeah those who call
walking Karma with Michael Madsen oh yeah that was sad to see and then the
third guest the lowest rated of them all I should have never called then why are you here I'm here to warn
you chopped out at a 4.2 well with snowfalls that's right in the
middle right snowfalls is right in the middle 3.1 alrighty my friends I
would like to make a toast so let's get this train going
snow falls to the movie Welcome to our half the pack episode about
snowfalls yes it's a title that works on so many levels because
snow falls from the sky and they go to the town of snow falls in
the film it works on many levels mainly too snowfall's AKA
some Zoomers can't handle a little cold that was the biggest thing wait shut up I've got an intro oh my God
look out idiots it's snow falls a movie released this
year that you probably haven't or will never see five young people inexplicably
go to a remote Cabin in the Woods to quietly celebrate New Year's Eve
as most young people in their 20s do that's when disaster strikes a huge epic
so a huge epic snowstorm suddenly shows up out of nowhere because it's the 1890s
and nobody has a cell phone that says there's a giant snowstorm coming you
can't predict these things and you don't look this information up when traveling to a remote cabin in the middle of
nowhere yeah uh oh then they lose power they also lose their minds and the
actors lose their dignity by appearing in this boring trash why are we reviewing this film well
because this year
you're drinking a spooky Halloween beer in January gross pumpkin pie spiced
Porter scary good see I'd probably like that I don't know why you're drinking it because there's nothing left we don't
have any beer left you're drinking Miller High Life that's true
what could you possibly be doing right now anyway it's time to talk about snowfalls a film
that uh was mind-bogglingly bad yeah
it's ironic that a big part of the movie is sleep deprivation because you're not going to have that problem if you watch
the movie I sent you a text like 30 minutes into it where I said I feel like I've been watching this for three hours
yes the movie's 80 minutes long but it feels like 880 minutes long uh yeah so I don't know what the story
is behind this I I we've never heard of it I've never heard of the the director his name's Colton Tran slash co-star
chill okay you're probably one of those weirdos who is like uh he's in the film uh he is an actor
all five main characters are a little little tiny actors they're little people
they're like 20 something years old but they're all little people and they they're all little actors they're all in
something like they're all working actors they're all working actors like one of them was
on a few episodes of Teen Wolf the MTV show Okay um
and in the trailer there's two bigger named actors uh Patrick Fabian uh who is
an older character actor he most recently uh according to IMDb he's been
on a ton of episodes of Better Call Saul so that's probably his most recent like claim to fame which is you know popular
series but you can get him for a zoom call for five seconds for this movie right and then um Jonathan Bennett
uh who I recognize because he is on a lot of those baking shows oh like uh
I've seen him on TV before okay he's he does those
cooking Halloween baking contest shows as himself yeah I think so and I think
he's he's also some kind of actor I don't really know the either these two guys very well I don't know any of these
people very well um but the two big names in the film both appear on zoomgal on the phone and
then on the laptop yeah and that's that's it they're like because the one the older guy plays the main character's
Dad yes and I'm not the main character but the the what says the main Cobain yeah there's only five characters but uh
he's the the kid that whose father owns this kiss no no sorry that's river river
I got all their names Jay oh that's great very helpful okay so yeah river is the rich kid whose dad owns the cabin
yeah um there's study girl who's studying in the car on the way
there you know did you did you pick up on the fact that she's a med student trust me
med student yeah I I recognize that did you pick up on that she knows a lot
about hypothermia the the writer director co-star he just went to Wikipedia and copy pasted large chunks
and that's her dialogue most people think that booze will keep you warmer but in reality it does the opposite you
know alcohol prevents your body from lots of its healthy reflexes one of which is keeping
the core body temperature warm in Colder Weather she also had some kind of backstory with cancer someone in her
family died of cancer so I have her a study girl slash Cancer girl her name's Eden I'm cold
um then there's paranoid m short for Emma I assume that's the girl
who it was the hypochondriac who kept saying her stomach hurt um and then uh uh kit is our our uh
director Colton Tran he's just there to party he's he lives on the edge man he didn't want to put a seatbelt on first
line of dialogue is I don't want to wear my seat belt I live on the edge man I'm like is it is that a joke yeah well kit refuses to
wear a seatbelt which I think is worse well I'm sorry that I like to live on the edge okay oh and then there's then
there's Andy and Andy is the vain uh content man yes he's the man who which
factors into the story in no way whatsoever zero uh he he he he he fancies himself a vlog a vlogger
slash uh content man yeah influencer that's something but we've never he he
claims to have like 20 000 followers or something and then you think that would come into play or he's like we're in
trouble we're stranded here let me try and reach out to my follower nope
it's basically the the core group of characters it's the movie is essentially a remake of cabin fever but in Cabin
Fever you have a a flesh-eating virus that makes everyone go crazy this movie
you have nothing that makes everyone go crazy you have people that were cold for half a day so they lose their minds but the
dynamic it's three guys two girls two of them are a couple uh one of them is
friend zoned by one of the other girls it's all very very similar to Cabin Fever yeah and it's very simple and then
it becomes bafflingly dumb yes and boring that's the thing this isn't a funny bad
movie we're not talking about like a money plane no but it's It's oddly fascinating that it would get made everyone in this movie is fine they're
all professional working actors the lead girl who played Eden was was convincing
everyone else was just like okay yeah they were fine compared to like I watched the trailers for all these other movies they all look like crap visually
they all have bad acting I skim through a little bit of the third guests and like it looks like a Neil Breen movie
every shot is like just claustrophobic close-up it's really bizarre and then
this movie looks really good like for a low budget movie like the the
cinematography is nice there's lots of like if it's not natural lighting they do a good job of replicating natural
lighting and yeah there's there's money behind it or just someone that really knows cameras and lenses and where to
place the camera to get good lighting with natural light from the windows it's
a good looking movie and then it's just like the dumbest you've ever seen in your life yeah it's like a like a
incongruity between how it looks and the actual content we need firewood River
that's an antique oh boy it's a terrible script
um should we should we go a brief overview of the plot I I laughed I laughed aloud when it starts it's it
starts with a close-up of a radio and it's like cycling through radio stations there's a there's been a horrible plane
crash if we're still awaiting information of
how many passengers or deercraft is believed to be weather related
I'm like kids going to a cabin in the woods on New Year's I don't know I don't know much else about it other than that
I thought maybe the plane crashed the pilot went insane and crashed the plane and then he got all burned up and he
looks like Two-Face and he's walking around the woods and he's he's your killer yeah I thought I thought that's I'm like why do you tell us about this
plane crash it ain't got nothing to do with the movie it's a red herring all the all the explanations for what's
going on are vague red herrings you just serious
serves the spreading wrap and the only one that makes any logical
sense is the stupidest which is that they all go crazy from being stuck in a cabin in the snow for a day
well we'll get to that but but the lines were just like I don't know if it's the script or the direction but the lines
were just like the first line is hey how much longer are we there yet
and then uh kit the influencer guy he's like GPS
says 15 minutes GPS says 15 minutes thank God
okay good yeah it's very like line cut and and then they get the point is
they're going to this nice house I don't I would even call it a cabin in the
woods it's a very large mansion and they're going there to celebrate New
Year's Eve and then they go there and it's like deathly quiet they're just
sitting around bored one guy the Colton Tran says let's do shots and it's like 1 30 in the
afternoon sure well yeah he's the party guy but they do shots and then they all like fall asleep and wait around and
then it's like a very quick Montage of them celebrating New Year's Eve and then oh she says hold on see what he does oh
my God okay so young people make dinner so what's for dinner stir fry and
everyone's helping a stir fry yeah we're making a stir fry
and then we watch them these are the scenes that you have
happened so you get to know your characters
like we know that they can make stir fry the young people
don't do this stuff though like I I was I was thinking in my head I
would I would rather see it would be enjoyable to watch a movie with this premise
just with old people like five old people like people in their 80s yeah go
to have a quiet New Year's Eve at a cabin and there's like a story nice to get out of the city right right and
they're just how long the GPS the gyps the old person will get
it wrong my Garmin my Garmin says 15 oh good because I gotta goal and then they
get there and then they point out that the one guy doesn't have his uh seat belt on he's like oh I forgot you're right right that's the reason he's not
wear it asleep and they're all just driving quietly they're not just like like the kids in their 20s would be like give
me your phone they'd be talking Non-Stop and they're just sitting quietly driving and then
they get there and they're just like so reserved and quiet and no one's no one's doing drugs no one's smoking weed no
one's like there is like some kind of sex stuff sort of he he jokes around he
climbs on her and says let this battle make for a great sex bed and she says my stomach hurts and he's like and then the
scene just ends it's just over yeah um
like a scream face like it's a Ghost Face Killer shows up in the window and
it's like like I'm gonna go kill some teens in the woods and it's just a bunch of elderly people oh
um I would like there's a little twist but so what I'm saying is for a movie written and directed by a
young person strangely all the characters act like
they were written by like a 75 year old person yeah and or directed by
an old person here's where you're going to turn on Dick Clark's Rockin New Year's Eve and eat just stir fry don't
forget to take your cholesterol and your blood pressure pills but that that was their night and it's
like and also it's it's apparently it's uh we'll talk about the
cold that's oh the main villain of the film yes we'll get into that and how completely illogical well it also
continuing what you were saying it also the movie feels very like prudish in a way that's weird like again
comparing this to Cabin Fever which is like a horny nightmare but uh
I didn't mean to do that
sorry I would describe but yeah like the there's a part in the
movie later in the movies one of the characters is hallucinating and he's hallucinating that the the main girl is
like seducing him yeah and she's like out of focus in the background she's like taking the the sleeve off her
jacket but she has like a full turtleneck underneath and he's like stop or you'll get cold it's like she's fully
dressed this is the seduction scene it would make sense if she's like naked and
like come to bed with me or let's get in a hot shower and then they start boning in the hot shower yeah which is sort of
in the movie they put that in the trailer to give you the illusion right there's some sort of life and and sex in
this film when there isn't right it's the one girl that takes her top off kind
of but she's from the back and it's because they want to get there they're trying to get body heat from each other
well they jump into the hot tub in the trailer and you're like oh yeah and then that scene is like 10 seconds long so
yeah you're right on that point is like you make a movie like this for two reasons to show naked people and
to have a violent murders and these are happen nothing happens yeah almost
nothing happens there's a couple hallucinations that are very jarring and look terrible and we'll get into them
when we talk about the colds yes so here's this is like the looming threat I was talking about the cold right we're
gonna get to it that's that's every uh every October November for us we're
we've been through all this I would say that this this movie was made by a bunch of little from California
well that's what I was thinking is the director like kid like he's never been outside of California well he says he
grew up in Utah and so I don't know where Utah can get cold maybe in
southern Utah I really don't know but yeah it does come across comical how like not ill-prepared they are but how
unrealistic so the whole thing is the snow the the power goes out because of
all the bad weather it's snowing constantly the roads they can't get out of the cabin because the roads are
completely blocked off by snow even though they never seem to get more than like an inch of snow through the whole
movie right even though it never stops snowing Yes except for the shots where it does yes um so they're trapped and over the
course of one day they all start to lose their minds right and they they kind of have some like allusions to oh maybe
there's something evil in the snow what if the snow is I don't know
somehow contaminated and it's like well that's stupid so it won't be that the only thing it could be they talk about
oh we got to stay awake because if we fall asleep this is more Wikipedia uh sniping so they all try to stay awake so
it's like oh okay so this is they're going crazy from sleep deprivation right that's the only thing that makes sense logically in the movie it's not evil
snow it's not toxins in the snow they eat the snow that's why they think that because they make snow cones for
so they can say we ate the snow maybe the snow's making just go crazy one brings snow cone juice
maybe they just poured booze on it I don't remember it was colorful okay yeah but so okay so there's this very
large property house cabin whatever you want to call it
uh it has a big fireplace it of course has electricity some sort of heater um there is a generator there's a generator
but it's out of gas well I kept waiting they keep cutting to the establishing shot of the house and one of the
characters early in the movie makes a Snowman and that snowman is so prominent in the foreground of all those
establishing shots I was like oh that's going to be their way of showing how much the snow accumulates by the end
you're just going to see like the top of the snowman's head but every time they cut to that the exterior throughout the
whole movie throughout several days it never accumulates anymore than where it's at at the beginning of the movies
about snow accumulation they put us plug-in effects of snow in
the foreground of the shot right um which they couldn't do for the scenes that they actually shot outside so it
just coincidentally every time they go outside the snow stops but we see the car after like three or four days of
them being there there's like a little bit of snow on the top of the car none of it none of it adds up just get
in the car and drive away do they ever say where they are where is snow falls
um I don't think so the North Pole I think because that's the thing is like sure a bomb Cyclone can happen you know
like recently I think it was a Buffalo New York got just tons of snow like six
feet whatever um that can happen usually that's not associated with
temperatures that are negative 300 degrees there's that too which which you would need
to worry about dying yes while having a
shelter this is like like exposure on Mount Everest kind of that's how they're
treating it yeah they have a house that's presumably insulated
so regardless even if it was zero out
the house probably would would top out at 50 or 40 degrees completely
survivable temperatures to where you could sleep yes and then that's the
whole thing is like that idiot medical student just says that that's we can't
sleep yeah because if you sleep is that on the first night or like the second it's like the first night yeah and she
says you can't have sugar yeah because you'll get a sugar rush but then you'll crash
sugar isn't a good idea wants to stay awake and it also a sugar
rush is not scientifically accurate either sure that's like uh what do they
call it not an urban myth um Old Maid old old wives tale oh yeah you know you
give them a bunch of sugar I mean sure yes you know it raises your blood sugar so she's like uh we can't you you you
can't fall asleep because uh if you fall asleep inside the
house yeah you'll die people can live in a tent in the cold you just you
might get frostbite that'll happen before hypothermia right which never happens in this movie no yeah before
your body just dies your your fingers will turn black and your toes will turn
black your nose will fall off so that'd be pretty creepy because all your blood goes to your inner organs yeah and your
it says forget about your extremities your nose your those aren't important your heart your lungs and and all that
is yeah and so that will happen before you die
and so it's snowing out it can't be like that cold yeah and then they have
blankets and they're inside a house and then and well and they have a huge ass fireplace and they even bring this up
and it drove me nuts yeah because they're like oh we don't have any wood to burn in the fireplace like we talk
about we have wood everywhere this whole house is we've got tables we got chairs and the kids like no those are antiques
so that's their justification for never throwing anything in the fireplace and the kid even says his friend even
says like your dad would your dad prefer you die or ruin some antiques it's like yeah
that makes sense why are we ignoring this it's only until three of the five main characters are dead that he decides
to start burning the Antiques so there's a limit yeah but yeah it's like I'm sure
not everything is an antique if I go get one of the beds from upstairs you know
like sure chop up you know there's so much raw material in the house and then
um and they're surrounded by the woods that one girl says are we out of dry
firewood okay so I guess we are I don't know a lot about camping and this kind of stuff but I guess we're to assume
that if they were to go outside and chop down a tree it wouldn't be wet to burn okay yeah that can happen I don't know
yeah I guess you have to dry out firewood but um but just the fact that like it's not
a science fiction movie it's not like our sun burnt out and the temperature outside is negative 500 Degrees that'd
be a better justification for what's happening yeah and so that a whole like premise I I would have been okay with
toxic snow sure they ate toxic snow and they went crazy but but we don't know that may be what happened the movie's
too vague to let us know for sure ambiguous it's keeping it ambiguous just like the shining right just like the
shine just like The Shining except without all the snow that makes you feel like they are
isolated and trapped oh yeah remember that in The Shining there's a ton of snow everywhere yeah
there's not a a quarter of an inch of snow Yeah so the main core of the movie
is girl decides that no one can fall asleep because they will die of hypothermia
and then the lack of sleep causes hallucinations yes which
hallucinations would really kind of be like a couple days three days
maybe longer and it's like one night well the the first thing that happens and this is before I even understood
that they were supposed to be crazy already they're in the kitchen the one guy's in the kitchen and they have the
the stove going the stove top yes and he immediately slams his hand down on it and I was like what's happening they
didn't even establish that they've gone crazy it just had he just was so cold he just wanted that heat and then but
they're like why did you do that and he just doesn't say anything it was so weird it was a weird way to introduce
that idea that they're starting to lose their minds because I didn't even it wasn't even established yet this is me
like stretching it but I realize the power's
out the gas was still working yeah hey you know with most gas stoves you could
just ignite it with a match so maybe that was like yeah it was because he's like oh heat and so that was like oh we
can't use the stove anymore oh God because you could just have all those burners on yeah and just be like waiting
for the rescue uh restoring to be rescued from an inch of snow was that the reason for that scene
I I don't I really don't know it's it's there is a lot of where you could tell as stupid as the movie is it does feel
like the direct the writer director co-star was like trying to think of everything yeah they'd get you for right
yeah that like us would get you for it but he failed so horribly at everything but everything's wrong I'm
not I'm I I really don't care about the getcha for as long as it's like
entertaining I watched a different movie that's very similar uh I don't know if you watched it was called sick
no it's not the Kevin Williamson written one yeah yeah I haven't watched that it was it was okay look at him it was a
little ridiculous but it was like kind of funny and it had a big getting in the middle and end but it was like yeah uh
young people like try to it was like it was very it seemed very late
to be commenting on pandemic stuff oh sure it came out in 2022 like towards the end about yeah pretty recently
towards the yeah I was like like uh young people who were in college go to a cabin in the woods to like ride out the
pandemic or something because it's right at the start and so they have their mass and they're talking about coronavirus
and and there's the people trying to kill them
and I don't want to spoil it but has like a little twist at the end and you know it has some logic to it and it has
a purpose and so I'm just like I'm like well okay if you have spooky haunted snow that's been poisoned by some kind
of government experiment that went wrong Cabin in the Woods right
um uh yeah or something related to the plane crash whatever whatever get just have give me some suspense give me some
excitement um give me some action violence
that sort of thing they tried to spice it up a couple times with the hallucinations
the spooky Snowman that's like a terrible CGI effect the the hallucinations was the only play they
had yeah in the whole movie it wasn't it wasn't like um you know interesting inter-character
drama like uh bodies bodies bodies oh yeah where it's like it feels like like
it's alive and the characters are interesting and yeah and um this or even going back to cabin
fever again like whatever problems that movie has it's so eccentric and weird that there's lots of things you remember
about it this movie doesn't have a pancakes kid no pancakes
right
and and it's it's just like a like a flat line and it's so dull you literally
could have done anything with with the location and the cast it's a good
location it's a decent Enough cast sure and it looks good the cinematography is
nice it was just they were banking on I think an attempt at a psychological
Thriller that's brought on by forced sleep deprivation which
to us midwesterners is laughable you can survive inside of a modern
structure without dying for more than two nights
without power yes uh I've done it
uh you would have to have I've never seen a spooky snowman come to life no
and I I mean I've gone without sleep but you have to go without sleep for quite a while to have like
really dangerous hallucinations I think well then the ultimate joke at the end
of the movie the whole idea is that they're trapped in this house because of all the snow everywhere and then the
cops to show up at the ends they just drive right up right yeah because they
couldn't do the effect of piles of snow Yeah but I get the point was that
you know nobody could sleep for and that caused hallucinations which which was
the threat or the horror in the movie but then you also need to
tack onto that strengths with your characters the
closest thing was the M girl who was a hypochondriac like cut her stomach open
oh yeah and it was like she's like I got it out right everybody the illness was I got it out it's like that's right I can
see how that would be creepy right uh the other guy just punched the one guy and he had died I guess or something
I don't remember but um but then you have the yeah the the river kid who was in love with Eden
and so that that's sort of that sort of played out um so there's a little bit of payoff
there but it's super weak yes foreign
are you done punching down this movie was made by children and
you're beating it up hey when we were children we also made a horror movie where nothing happened so that's true we
have the authority to speak on the subject right
and Colton trans 58 like me he couldn't sit he could sit with a pumpkin beer and
complain just like I am no I just I just see it as a uh
like a creative disappointment like
what yeah what were you doing like what like I don't know you gotta you gotta
you gotta go big you gotta go big you gotta double down you gotta you gotta make something that people remember like
or you make some kind of like this feels like exploit of trash without the exploit of
trash like I said nudity and Gore you're too you know
Hallmarks of a horror picture I I you know if you have good characters I don't
mind the lack of nudity of Gore in a horror oh yeah sure no you can go simple five people in a cabin you just have to
be really clever this movie lacks all the meat of any kind of like what a movie needs it doesn't have anything
with the exception of a I don't even want to I don't even care about the creepy moments nothing was creepy the
only thing that just visually looked kind of creepy there's a part where someone's looking in a closet and that creepy hand comes down yeah that's not
bad good job get three seconds of spooky in
your 80 minute movie and we're out
oh the door sound effects showed up gotta mention that door squeak
get it out of there can't use it anymore unless you're doing a comedy internet series
there is one I don't know what we'll call it we'll
call it an and action moment where it feels like we're seeing the
shop before the actors start it's very rare but they happen and it's
when they happen in movies like after last season
and action
we're building up snowfalls we're saying you could do better
you could do better snowfalls you could have made a better film and this is why
and these are our opinions don't let this guy write the next one I didn't he didn't write it someone else
wrote it oh really Story by kind of thing oh yeah and I saw the writer's credits and it's like all those like
junk movies you see on doobie oh okay so I junk two B movies clown Massacre six
or whatever yes yes haunted house
yeah like with those like awful Photoshop covers it's just like junk to be films I think maybe with this movie
he was going for like an a24 minimalist Art House thing maybe that's what he was
trying to do just made all my skin crawl thinking of that I thought I'm just
trying to I just I honestly don't understand what it is I'm just trying to make sense of it I've seen trailers for
trash movies that have that try to emulate that that a24 Vibe oh
yeah it's kind of a style now as far as
like trailer editing goes yes it is yeah yes it is uh this if that if that's if
that was the attempt uh it failed on a on a big big scale
but um I mean whatever it was attempting to do it failed the fact that we don't know what it was trying to do is a sign
that it failed yeah it's just such a bizarre non-movie it's it's one of those
where it's like well uh here's a script for like a cheap horror movie that's super super easy to make very little
like practical effects just a couple of like little scare moments you shoot it I
think I think it said it was shot in six days that makes sense so it's like uh maybe it was like okay I'm pitching
this to an investor I'm going to get x amount of dollars for it I could shoot in six days I'm gonna flip it uh we can
get it here I can I'm gonna attach these two names to it it's going to make this you know like a like a skim off the top
kind of made some money move on kind of thing but if it was an old like man in his 60s you know like I would I would
think that but considering this this Colton Tran is a younger guy I would imagine he would have loftier goals than
just trying to make a cheap Buck like like an old old B movie like hack yeah
do you know what I mean oh sure I would imagine he was trying to go and try to achieve something and this feels like
no one's trying to achieve anything they're just trying to get through it and move on to the next thing
um so yeah you might be right with the a24 like modern horror twist I really don't know
that's all I got that's what makes it fascinating is that it's a mystery
it's a mystery it could be a tax scam for all I know
we spent 150 million dollars on the movie
it lost 149 million dollars
it's it's just like in the movie what's really going on we don't know it's in
that snow what's in that snow we don't know we don't know what's in that snow that's a good tagline for the movie we
don't know what's in that snow Yeah it arrives sketchy well I thought the title of the movie
should have been look out colds well that's not bad but can you imagine the characters go we don't know what's in
that snow and they're going outside and they're throwing it and it just the camera just Zooms in and the one guy goes we don't
know which you have like the uh Chief Brody shot and Jaws when he's on the beach and we're zooming in on him staring out of
the water yeah we have one yep like like uh it was a nuclear
reactor Towers the camera you know booms down when the snow's falling
we show a deer in the woods and it's like eating a leaf and some of the snow
gets in its mouth and goes Blood starts coming out of its eyes
I don't know what's in the snow it's stiff no who wants
and that cuts the black we don't know what's if oh
the title comes in it's spelled out in snow that's blowing through the shot
directed by Ari Astor 's snoring cocaine
all this imagery of like powder yeah girls just doing makeup
and every now and then
being a conspiracy theorist because that's an actual line in the movie isn't it
just because this cabin is one mile away from those nuclear reactor towers and
it's blowing gas this way that's mixing with the snow that's falling all around
the house doesn't mean there's anything wrong with those snow
what if the Snowman that's on the front yard
they keep cutting to it if somebody like knocks into it or something happens and
the snow comes off and there's like a skeleton inside of it yeah sure why not
foreign so many things you can do with evil snow instead everyone just makes stir fry
and and has a couple of uh alcoholic beverages
but just a couple just a couple not too much no one gets really drunk and then they all go to bed at 1202 A.M
on New Year's Day great film 10 out of 10.
would highly recommend
we don't know what's in the snow
