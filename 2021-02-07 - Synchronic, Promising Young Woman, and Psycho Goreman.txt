"half in the back"
"get out of my living room"
hey jay what's that what did armie hammer
say when his girlfriend left him
what
i want my baby back baby back baby back
i want my baby back baby back baby back
i thought of that joke yesterday all on my own
someone out there in the internet may have also thought of the same joke
it would have to be a boomer
it was probably a boomer
and uh no
younger people don't get that reference
that's true
so that narrows down the amount of people that may have come up with that joke
i did not steal it
i may have originated it
so i'm thinking of trying to sell jokes to the tonight show starring jimmy fallon
that's about the level caliber
maybe
maybe lesser
that's
i'd say that your joke's a little bit above that
you know what's unfortunate though jay
is now that the packers aren't going to be playing in this the big game
what are we going to watch
yeah i mean what do we have to look
forward to now that the packers aren't
going to be playing in the
the big game well maybe we could watch
some movies
we got all those streaming channels what

bungled well [ __ ] since we can't look
forward to any of the new hollywood
blockbusters
i guess we're gonna have to deep dive
some movies on streaming
sure i'll uh i'll set the remote to
random mode
come on come on no whammies no whammies
big bucks big bucks snow whammies
and stop it's and chronic
what the hell is that a movie about
truck stop boner pills
well i guess there's only one way to
find out jay
hit play let's watch synchronic
this isn't the most comfortable seating
position to watch a film on
no we're good we're good here we go i
mean now i just see the back of your
head
am i in your way you're completely in my
way oh cry
in marvel studios action-packed spy
thriller synchronic
natasha romanov aka synchronic
confronts the darker parts of her ledger
when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to
her past arises
pursued by a force that will stop at
nothing to bring her down
natasha must deal with her history as a
spy and the broken relationships
left in her wake long before she became
a synchronic
so mike what did you think of
synchronics
uh i kind of liked it
i didn't love it uh it was a little all
over the place and the script was a
little
uh patchy and uh
okay at times it had some interesting
concepts but then it
failed in interpersonal dialogue and
characters
and jay you have a little bit of a
backstory synchronic which is why
uh you were very happy when it appeared
randomly i was so excited when it
randomly uh
arrived on this film because it's
directed by a duo
of filmmakers justin benson and aaron
morehead and i don't think
they've ever come up on our show ever
but i've been a big fan of their movies
their previous movies they're all very
very very small scale movies very low
budgets
very character driven and
this one i guess is like their biggest
budget movie they have real
names in it anthony mackey and james
duhan
of course from the 50 shades of grey
films uh
yeah so tell us more about um uh justin
royal and daenerys
well this is it you've seen one other
thing that they've done
i have they they famously did an episode
of the new twilight zone and by famously
i mean nobody's seen it except us
right it figured out that somehow
during this operation there were to
occur a mutation or sabotage
of genetic material and this same gene
is manipulated for octopus
sea life could rise out of the ocean and
stop life on land
it would do what evolution did it 700
million years ago
put an end to the human species they
didn't write it
and they've written all their movies the
i think the twilight zone episode was
just a
director for hire kind of thing you want
to exploit
the neurological properties of this
octopus species
gene into a human egg
giving human beings the best traits of
vertebrates and zephobots
so if you bile engineered this gene
you would create a new species of humans
our eyes and skin
would have the ability to taste and see
and react without reporting to a
centralized brain
yeah and so this feels in the same vein
as their previous movies just
but as a fan of their previous movies i
thought it was disappointing
um it felt i don't know if they were
intentionally trying to make something
more mainstream but it felt like
instead of things being left kind of
vague and open they
explain exactly what's happening uh
mainly through anthony mackey
doing his he has he's like doing a video
diary and he's explaining
i guess spoilers but it turns out like
when the movie starts you're seeing like
all this
trippy imagery and people are on this
drug called synchronic and
you don't really know what's happening
and it turns out that
it's just a drug that can make you
travel through time
which is weird and simplistic and kind
of dumb
yeah well the premise is uh human beings
have a pineal gland
yes though it's the the second film in
motion picture history to have the plot
hinge on the pineal gland
the first being uh from beyond where
jeffrey combs
pineal gland pops out of the front of
his forehead
please crawford it won't hurt
i promise
um yeah so the pineal gland when you're
young
it's there when you get older it
calcifies and the pineal gland
is responsible for your brain's
interpretation of time
and in this film's logic
messing with the pineal gland literally
changes time
because i think they say somewhere in
the movie like the theory of scientists
the physicists say the time
doesn't exist time is is
is is all around us it's it's like the
rings on a tree you know
it's christopher nolan s gobbledygook to
try and justify the story
yes it's it's it's a very loosely
justified story
and in most cases that's fine as long as
it's backed up
with really really solid characters that
you really are rooting for
and this is where the movie falls short
for me me too
um but then we meet our two characters
our two
protagonists it's uh they're two
ambulance workers emts right
the very opening scene like kind of
hooked me they go into like this run
down
nasty house the movie takes place in new
orleans
um and there's this weird girl and she's
like like tripping out and saying
there's a male victim on the floor he
has a knife wound that comes out of his
back so they're like oh my god he got
impaled by his sword there's another
girl unrelated
to synchronic is i think she's just
there odd on heroin
so they give her narcan which
reverses the effects of opioids
but so it's kind of this intriguing uh
little scene and it's kind of done
like one take situation yeah yeah that's
like i was saying about their style it's
very kind of loose
yeah following along yeah weird loose
and it has this like kind of like
um ambient creepy soundtrack that makes
you uncomfortable
the whole time and so i was into it yeah
even when he's because what happens is
jamie dornan's daughter
disappears she's taken the drugs and
chronic and she's vanished and they're
trying to figure out what happened to
her so there's a mystery angle
um and and uh anthony mackey is jamie
dornan's best friends and i kind of
liked
the idea of their relationship it's a
different sort of like
two-guy relationship than you see in a
lot of movies yeah in the very beginning
of the film anthony mackie is wearing a
like a sports jersey because his uniform
got glitter on it
right because i guess he's an avid strip
club addict
slash sleep arounder
i don't want to say womanizer i guess
that's a kind of a negative term
he treats his ladies with respect sure
he says
i got to go to work lock the door yeah
it's fine he doesn't say get out
right he's not awful let's see i'm
picturing like the michael bay version
of these
characters relationships like the bad
boys movies and that kind of stuff
he is um kind of his life jamie dornan's
got his life together
he has an 18 year old daughter and a
baby on the way uh and then anthony
mackie is like polar opposite he's he's
a bachelor
he doesn't know what he's doing with his
life he drinks a lot
he sleeps around and so that that kind
of dynamic comes into play because they
have conversations about that
and to me like that's the meat of the
movie the heart
is those two characters and a lot of
their dialogue
and conversational moments seem kind of
uh underwritten or the writers
writing out of his pay grade where he
doesn't quite
it comes off as like like an 18 year old
trying to write
40 year olds he's like man my wife
man when i first met her i was in love
doubts man they never go away you know
you think the wedding day
is gonna dissolve that and it is
profound but you know the doubts they
never did i get it bro you're a guy in a
relationship
i think my marriage is um
i think i'm getting a divorce
and he's like but now i don't care
because i'm doing it like i got the
white picket fence and all
and and i come home and from work
and she makes me dinner or whatever but
i i don't know if i want
more or whatever man and i'm like no no
no no no no
yeah we don't see each other anymore you
know she wasn't any good in bed she was
beautiful but we
had too many arguments that's too bad my
lisa is great when i can get it
oh man i just can't figure women out
sometimes they're just too smart
sometimes it's flat out stupid other
times they're just evil
it seems to me like you're an expert
mark
no definitely not an expert johnny
what's bothering you mark
nothing man do you do you have some
secret forget it why don't you try it
i'm i'm paraphrasing to say the least
sure to say the very least it's not that
bad
their first movie resolution is almost
exclusively two guys in a cabin together
and they're old friends one of them is
kind of like a party guy he's gone off
the
wagon and they're trying to to get him
sober so they're staying at this cabin
all weekend
so the whole movie is those two guys it
hinges on those two guys
and they're really great together in the
movie um
and then their other movies too are like
that where they're they're very focused
on just a couple of characters
uh in previous movies they've always
been younger characters
like they did a movie spring and it's a
guy whose mother dies and he
decides to go on like a backpack journey
through rome
you know young young guy things yeah and
this they're talking about yeah like
having a wife and a daughter and it
feels like i don't know anything about
the director's writer's personal lives i
don't know
if that comes from there but it feels
like writing something that
you're not overly familiar with right
right yeah how was work today
oh pretty good we got a new client at
the bank
will make a lot of money what client i
cannot tell you it's confidential
oh come on why not no i can't anyway
how is your sex life if that's our our
thing that we're supposed to cling on to
it's it's a little
it's a little weak it's a lot on thin
ice yeah and then our our
premise is also on thin ice i'm willing
to accept
an outrageously unbelievable premise
because
uh popping some kind of pill that messes
with a gland in your head
won't literally send you back in time it
would be fine if their hallucinations
made it seem like they were back in time
like maybe those
maybe the stoners were just like
watching a program i think they did
something like that they showed the tv
screen
and they're watching some kind of like
history channel show
or they're in the opening scene yeah
yeah and and i thought okay they're
what they're see what they saw on tv is
kind of like what's in their head
yeah after they feel like reality drop
the acid they that's what that's what
comes to them
yeah but no that's that's why i was
disappointed when it was just oh
they're literally traveling through time
yeah yeah and yeah but yeah the concept
is uh
it's younger people their pineal gland
is still soft
so it's more susceptible when you take
the drug anthony mackey because
of his tumor his pineal gland is soft so
even as an older person he's able to
travel through time right
and he uh has only a handful of pills
left they're not
out available anymore he bought them all
up from one store
and he's going to uh try and figure out
the mechanics of how this time travel
works so he can
travel to the time period where jamie
dornan's daughter
disappeared to and rescue her so that's
another problem is that you have no
connection to the daughter character
either
she's in a couple of scenes yeah she's
just kind of generic daughter
and he is trying to find jamie dornan's
daughter because
because they're best friends
johnny's my best friend even though the
premise is a little goofy if the
character's really strong and you cared
about him
saving her it would help a lot we need
we needed more scenes with the daughter
yeah and we needed her to call him
um i don't know what's his character's
name i don't know it's anthony
it's like it's like john and dave
so she's like uncle dave hey you know
come on over and like he's
he and then he has to drop her off at
school and while he's taking her to
school he's like so
you're gonna go to college you know okay
you know maybe i'll think about it like
he
takes her under his wing they have a
special relationship i don't think he
has a scene with her
uh except for when she's sitting on the
paper mache rock yes that's the same as
paper mache rock yeah they go to a
family
a party i think it's a baby shower uh
for the
wife's baby and um she's sitting on the
paper mache rock she's
doing the teenager thing i'm ah this is
all lame man whatever
and he comes over and just sort of like
hey hey what's up yeah yeah
well uh you having a cigarette yeah okay
bye
while it wasn't eat there is a sequence
where anthony mackie goes through and
it's like a montage sequence almost
where he's learning about how to
use the socratic drug and how it works
and i've i've detailed it in my notes
and it takes quite a while but that's
one
part of the movie that's interesting but
that's the strongest part i like that
the trial and error aspect
yeah but that takes away from the
character building with the daughter
that could have strengthened the
end sure because we have that and then
we also
uh have the the racism element which was
introduced and never
paid off yeah that's what i wanted to
talk about because it
the climax of the movie it ends up being
a big part of that but it feels so
unrelated to the overall point of the
movie
and there we go what did you do hey come
here
i think you busted her back
racist baby woven throughout the film
there is a theme of racism
that it doesn't feel like they knew what
to do with it they didn't know what to
do with it
it wasn't warranted and it wasn't paid
off
because yeah the setup is anthony mackey
you know they they go to their
their call at that house with the sword
victim and stuff and anthony mackie's
not wearing his uniform
cops show up they pull a gun on anthony
mackie they call him tupac
and so there's like undercurrent of
modern day racism
yes um and then there's a couple but
then that kind of goes away after that
and then there's a couple parts when
he's traveling through time
the one thing we learn is that there is
no racism in the ice age
that's true first trip
uh the first time he drops the syncrotic
um
he ends up in a swamp and he's
confronted by a spanish conquistador
uh he tries to kill him okay i don't
know if that's racism or
just hey what's that yeah who are you
i'm gonna kill you weird clothes
yeah um the second trip is the ice age
which was my favorite part
um because he meets you know like a crow
magnum
man who's walking and then he sees a
woolly mammoth and it's like hey this is
cool okay so he went all the way back to
the ice age
neat so now he's established that
taking the drug in this same spot will
bring you back to the exact same spot
which of course comes into play later
so it goes back to the 20s ish
um and then there's like old-timey
racists kkk guys were like
what are you doing here and um and
that's the first reminder of that
there's supposed to be any sort of theme
of race another racist
theme but that works as its own scene
where it's like well yeah that would be
[ __ ] scary for anthony maggie in this
situation yes
he doesn't know what time period he's
going to go to and what sort of
situation he'll find himself
right um so it's like if that's an
isolated scene
that's its own thing and that's fine but
now at this point this is after the
opening tupac scene
and then when we get to the ending which
we'll get to where it's like okay i
guess this is supposed to be a
reoccurring theme
stuck in the rocking 50. it [ __ ] back
to the future
pass was hey he does he does bring up
racism again
when he's drunk in the bar and he's he's
kind of talking to the bartender who's
not listening to him and he's like he's
like
if he had the same wacky adventure that
marty mcfly did
the results for him would be much
different so that's a comment on
racism yeah okay okay i'll get to tim i
just need to know if there's somebody
else that might need some help
rihanna uh they discovered
on one of their calls earlier that she
had vanished from a house party
and so a drunk girl says that's the last
time i saw her was sitting in that chair
then he discovers that the girl wasn't
sitting in the chair she may have
wandered off so all bets are off
so then he says maybe she went over to
her favorite
paper mache rock because there's a
carving on carved always
misspelled into the rock uh so then the
final trip
is uh on on the the
the banks of what i assume is the
louisiana river maybe it's the
mississippi is that where the
mississippi ends down in louisiana might
be the mississippi river
i don't know there's a civil war battle
going on and that's our final spot and
that's where he finds the daughter
yes so he travels back to the civil war
um
midst of a big battle yes and that's
that's a weird note to end the movie on
this is supposed to be the emotional
climax of the film him saving the dog
sacrificing himself to save the daughter
the whole racism angle feels really
underdeveloped and disconnected
from the main point of the story where
it's like that's such a
it feels like it's supposed to be an
uplifting ending like oh he did it he
saved his friend's daughter
but it's so horrible like that that's
his fate
it didn't feel like it was intentionally
supposed to be that horrible that's just
how it comes across
right well he is a man uh who is dying
anyways
and you add that mix into the mix yeah
they should have had a scene like
right before he decides to go back to
save the daughter he gets a call from
this doctor
the the brain tumor isn't is not
terminal
and he still chooses to still choose to
save the daughter out of selfless
selfish sacrifice yeah i don't know
which makes it more disappointing when
it because i kind of like the middle the
best
part of the movie is that middle chunk
where he's doing like the trial and
error stuff it's kind of fun we're
seeing his
his uh you know camcorder footage and
him trying all these different things
and
but then by the time they get to the end
it reminded me a bit speaking of
christopher nolan again it reminded me
of like interstellar
where it starts is kind of like a more
straightforward sci-fi
film and then by the end it devolves
into schmaltzy mellow drama
and this is similar yeah for for an
alternate uh
comparison um uh and i
probably maybe four people out there
listening will get this but
if you watch amazing stories there is an
episode of amazing stories which is very
similar to this
the new amazing story new amazing oh
that's the one episode i watched i think
with the the girl from
blind manners right yes the house the
the
the annoying millennial with the phone
uh who's
repairing an old house and in the
basement during a storm
there's a barometer which magically
transports him back in time
and then you know he falls in love with
the woman and they bounce around through
time he goes to the future trying to
find lost
love and yeah and you end up like kind
of caring about those characters and
then in the end it all
gets wrapped up nicely in a much more
confined
condensed period of time than synchronic
yeah and it works better on an emotional
level than security does
and again the perfect example because
why the [ __ ] does a barometer in the
basement
during a lightning storm caused someone
to travel through time yeah
no reason it doesn't matter that's your
setup two ley lines intersect there
yeah you just come up with some [ __ ]
i mean
that's a lot of science fiction it's
just it's [ __ ]
and but as long as you like the
characters you know
doc doc brown's flux capacitor we don't
need to know how it works
that needs a bolt of lightning to charge
it up
and it can travel through time somehow
we don't care but marty mcfly's
adventures
and him trying to save himself from
being erased from existence and
all that that's that's magic
this movie not so much
well that was synchronic um let's see
what else we got on that i get to do it
now
oh my god okay do you know how to use
the remote
is there a menu button okay
oh i found it okay here we go random
mode
random and go come on come on
no whammies no whammies and stop
what the [ __ ] is this promising young
woman
is this a rom-com no
some girl works at a coffee shop is this
like a like one of those
drew barrymore movies from the 90s
that's what it looks like
well i hope the film is promising let's
give it a watch
we've got nothing else to do and
play
am i still in your way no not anymore i
found a good position i'm just going to
try to hold this position
yeah i have to i have to put my armor on
the back of the chair so i stay in the
right spot
i'm gonna try to hold the pistol i hope
this movie's pretty short
oh my god promising young woman
and her grandpa used to be very close
but when grandpa jack
moves in with the family promising young
woman is forced to give up her most
prized possession her bedroom promising
young woman will stop at
nothing to get her room back scheming
with friends to devise a series of
pranks to drive him out
however grandpa doesn't give up easily
and it turns into an all-out war
between the two well that was promising
young woman
uh film starring carrie mulligan
from drive from drive and other things
and this was a movie i had seen the
trailer for many many many many months
ago
i think this was a pre-pandemic movie
that got postponed yeah and it was
i think it had a lot of buzz behind it i
don't know if it was from playing at
film festivals or something but
people were looking forward to this
movie and i knew almost nothing about it
yeah the trailer was intriguing
um you know it's a what
genre i don't even know if it's a genre
but a rape revenge film
yeah i may have loved it
if if it was doing what i hoped it was
doing
okay i guess we'll get into it i i liked
it quite a bit too
i wasn't sure what i thought about it at
the beginning i wouldn't say i hated it
you said you hate it at the start
in the middle in the middle okay because
yeah it started it felt a little
like oh like it's hitting you over the
heads
messagey um but then it starts to get
very
intentionally kind of muddled with its
morality
and what it was trying to do and what it
was trying to say and i appreciated that
it was
a dark comedy because that helped a lot
yeah because otherwise it would be so
nihilistic i mean it is kind of
nihilistic but um
sanders right that's the word um
but that that dose of black comedy and
the energy of the direction really
helped carry it along
right in a way that kept you intrigued
yeah you gotta kind of
walk on eggshells with a topic like this
and i kind of at first i thought that's
why it had such high
ratings right because the movie is about
the the the overly masculine rapey
culture of of frat guys and
the denial of a woman
claiming she was assaulted and they
bring up all those different
like they all those different like
cliches or excuses that that uh come up
after something like that happens it's
particularly pronounced in the scene
with connie britton
oh and she's the dean of the college and
um carrie mulligan goes back and she's
like i'm going to come back to medical
school and she's like okay
she has a very hard time after her
sexual assault and i think at some point
she died
and i it's implied it was a suicide but
i don't think it's ever
specifically said but then she's like i
get i get cases like
like this like 15 a day uh and boys will
be boys
uh people don't want to confront it they
want to write it yeah yeah
and then it's a movie that's very much
like it plays so much different it's
about like what's happening now and how
people are looking at situations like
that
so much differently now than they were
even like 10 years ago
and that's exactly what this is is about
10 to 15 years ago
you know we get accusations like this
all the time it was years ago what would
you say
i am a nice guy every guy's worst
nightmare getting accused like that
we were kids if i hear that one more
time
i have to give him the benefit of a
doubt ruin a young man's life
and our our heroine cassie played by
carrie mulligan
was in med school her best friend this
happened to her it kind of messed her up
as well
so she dropped out of med school and
kind of now she's just a layabout
um lives with her parents dad is clancy
brown
which is great because he's just a nice
guy i was waiting for him to pull out a
sword and try and chop someone's head
off and he didn't do that
right um but but anyway i was saying so
with this
with this like subject matter it's like
well you better give this a good review
yeah or else and so i see like 99 around
tomato score and i'm like
is it because of the message more so
than the quality of the movie exactly
and then you watch the movie and
tonally it's bizarre and and it's
in a good way in a way that works no it
has a very kind of like
poppy aesthetic which is a nice contrast
to how
dark the subject matter is it reminded
me a lot of heathers
the christian slater uh winona ryder
movie yeah
that that sort of balance of dealing
with this really dark subject matter
in a darkly comedic way
it's the the contrast of like at the end
when she's going up to the house and
there's like this
this creepy slow version of britney
spears toxic
and things like that and her character
is very like sarcastic and
uh it has this weird vibe of like
it kind of feels like it's doing like an
empowerment thing like she's going to
get revenge on all these people
but it's morally ambiguous because she's
so [ __ ] up and she's doing bad things
too
i think it's supposed to be like an
outsider's perspective
of of her situation we don't ever
because inside her head things
are much darker and we get the
we get the the poppy fun uh early 2000s
rom-com
look at it yeah fro from the audience
perspective
and and i think that's where it just
throws me for a loop because i'm not
quite sure
exactly how to take what they were doing
or
if they were attempting something else
and failing miserably at it
or if it was done with surgical
precision
i really don't know i mean it all feels
intentional to me i guess we'll get into
spoilers because i'm curious what you're
talking about
we'll get into sports so like you said
she lives with her parents still
she doesn't care about progressing in
life she's very
very stunted by
these events in college and she's she
holds
lots of anger and carrie mulligan and it
all kind of comes back to the surface
because people related to this event
start to come back into her life
yes and that's that's the trigger point
is when bo burnham comes into the coffee
shop
and he's like hey you know you're so and
so we went to
med school together and i'm just kind of
stunned
and he's he's really trying hard he's
he's set up to be the nice guy
and there's a couple of earlier scenes
where
there's some cat collars the the
construction guys
i did like that moment because that's
such a cliche concept
the the cat calling construction worker
guys and the fact that she just like
stands there and stares at them
and they start to make less comments and
then they just get horribly creeped
out and leave yeah they start calling
her names yeah
that worked for me in a way that some of
the other bits because her thing is
she'll go out on weekends
and at first you don't know what she's
doing because she has like a diary where
she's keeping tabs and like is she
killing these people
but yeah she pretends to be drunk uh so
men will
will try to take advantage of her take
her back to their apartments or whatever
and then she immediately she's not drunk
at all she immediately sobers up
and makes them feel horribly
uncomfortable about what they're trying
to do
with varying degrees of how bad what
they're doing is
to her it's all the same and it doesn't
matter right um
but but we don't know at first if she's
killing people or something because she
has a little diary
she's keeping tabs she's keeping a tally
you know like is she killing these
people
it turns out it's not that severe no the
diary the the
the check marks are color coded too so
it might be like red is more intense
yeah what their actual attempt at rape
and then there's like
the scene with mclovin yeah and he's
just like i don't know what he does he's
just kind of being pushy
and and so that i think he's just trying
to kiss her or something yeah
that might get like a like a light blue
you know so she's yeah she's
doing that to what end i don't know
maybe just to shame them
yeah i think that's it she's just trying
to to [ __ ] with these people so they
don't do this to other people
well from the perspective of like to
call this a rape revenge movie i mean
that's a whole sub-genre in like the
70s 80s grindhouse kind of circuit
the most famous being i spit on your
grave but the point being like all those
movies
were made by men and they are all like
all the male characters are just
monsters in it so this is kind of a play
on those type of movies but it's
directed by a female written by a female
so it has that different angle which i
think again lends to the sort of
dark comedy satirical angle of it yeah
it is a different look at those kinds of
movies because um
she meets bo burnham who i believe is a
comedian yeah
slash actor and director he directed a
movie called
yeah and so he shows up and for all
accounts
he's the nice guy there is an
embarrassing
montage sequence that oh
very much so plays tongue-in-cheek and
i'm hoping that oh it
feels like a romantic comedy sequence
yes it's it's
if it's tongue-in-cheek they're dancing
around the uh
the farm pharmacy through a paris hilton
song
like ironically dancing to a paris
hilton song they're singing and
they keep cutting to that and then they
keep cutting them like like
having breakfast in bed and doing like
everything's great
and yeah and it's it's really in your
face and i'm like
if this is real um i'm cringed out but
if this
is this if this is tongue-in-cheek and
self-aware
it's brilliant because of course then
later on
that's when the movie gets darker yes
yeah uh we discover
spoilers did we say spoilers we already
said spoilers um
there uh is a secret video given to her
by her friend allison brie
actually her ultimate goal is to get
alice and bri to cheat on her husband
with a handsome man at the bar well to
make it doesn't breathe i think
she got raped that's the thing this is
what he keeps right in that line of like
is she gonna cross over into being just
as awful as these people
that she's you know uh obsessed with not
obsessed with but
still feeling trauma from she wants to
put people it's like
i don't know um
god what is like i know what you did
last summer
something in that vein where an event
from the past
an event from the past comes back to
haunt and she's the she's the guy
in the raincoat with the hook who's
making them
all like kind of be forced to relive
this event so
allison bree knew what happened but
she's like oh so long ago that was like
10 years ago
everybody's just trying to forget about
it everyone's trying to forget you know
they don't the same with connie britton
they don't want to
to confront how awful it is yeah but
she has an old old-timey cell phone that
has a video
of the event yeah which thankfully they
don't show
no of course that makes it more
impactful and uh
so they they watch the video and you
hear the sounds
it's like party dude frat dudes like
laughing and you know so
and she has a horrified look on her face
later on we realize
what the actual horrified look on our
face is
is because a good guy all around good
guy
beau burnham was there egging it on
he is now also a bad guy
and um that's when she goes off the deep
end that's when she goes off the deep
end and that's when the movie gets
fun fun in a very dark
horrible way and it turns into a
a wacky 90s 2000s rom-com
with this undercurrent of a horrible
event with with a dark
sinister twist to it and i think that's
that's
that's where i was like on board cause
the the middle
was like oh my god what is the tone here
and then it's like the parents and she
lives at home with the parents and it's
all set up like a wacky rom-com
with that that disturbing backstory
um so then the end of the film they have
a douchey bachelor party they think she
shows up
in a clown wig and a sexy nurse outfit
yeah they think she's a stripper
um but she's there
she's there to uh really give it to the
guy
the guy is i forget his character's name
but
he he's poised now to have a a
great successful life he's he's now a
doctor he's about to get married
uh blah blah blah again everybody wants
to just forget about this event they've
moved on with their lives
she wants them to pay for it so yeah i
guess at this point
we won't discuss the ending because
to me that was the most shocking part uh
it was the most
hard right turn i've seen in a film in a
while
because you you expect it to go a
certain way and it
goes a very dark way yeah and um but
still has a satisfying
final moment final conclusion yeah
definitely it's it's it's all very
satisfying
and um the inclusion
of max greenfield in the film
what the doctor's here you don't know
him he's uh
he plays schmidt on new girl he's
more of a comedic actor he's done some
dramatic roles but oh he's the like best
friend
he's the best friend who helps coming up
when there's a moment when
he realizes something and he and he's
yeah
and it's like oh my god it's schmidt and
i feel like i'm watching a new girl
episode
and it's just like what's going on
schmitz
you it's either a disastrous attempt
to make a rape revenge film or a very
genius execution of a rape revenge film
done as a play on a dark comedy
version of the early 2000s rom-com
that i to me that seemed if it's exactly
like what they were doing
if it's the latter i wholeheartedly
recommend it yeah
yeah no i i would recommend it too i
thought it i mean i love
dark comedy and you don't see a lot of
them anymore
um i think because it is so hard to
ride that line of of having to be
serious but still have the humor work in
a way that isn't a detriment to
the the series undertone yeah a movie
like this
can easily have the opposite effect if
you make
a movie about you know getting back at
the guy the guy or guys in college that
had a drunken
rape thing happen and you just it's just
dirty and dark and
you gotta get them and it could leave
you with just like
just feeling gross feeling gross i mean
obviously some movies that's the
intention
this movie perfectly executes its
message
in in kind of a dark and and
strange and and fun way yeah to where to
me it's more
impactful i wanted to be a doctor my
whole life
lately i've been feeling like i might
want to get back into it
should we go again yeah third time's the
charm
all right maybe we'll get something a
little more uplifting this time yeah all
right
and random
i'm not gonna look okay i'm not gonna
look okay
and stop what is it
stop psycho gore man what
the [ __ ] is that it's psycho gore man
psycho gorman has left active service
his piece is
short-lived when felix lighter an old
friend from the cia
turns up asking for help leading psycho
gorman
on the trail of a mysterious villain
armed with a dangerous new technology
wow um well that was certainly different
that was the strangest take on a rape
revenge
film i've ever seen this is a little bit
of tonal whiplash from uh
following up promising young woman with
that promising young
space monster named psycho gorman
from the guys behind astron
6. one of them the guy behind astron 6
the the canadian movie making
company that has produced such hit films
as the editor
and man borg and divorced dad
the web series which i don't know if you
can watch that anywhere i know there's a
blu-ray of it but it's not on youtube
i don't think i haven't seen any of this
oh no i saw some divorce dad
we watched one episode i've seen the
whole thing it's amazing
if you can find divorce dad watch it
well i guess we should say right up
right off the bat then full disclosure
uh we do have a very very tiny
connection to this film
our friend and lover rich evans has a
very brief
uh voice cameo in the film he does the
rumors are true
yeah he's in the end credits but the
rumors are true
rich voices uh i don't know the
character has a name which is nice
uh but he's he plays a character that is
just a giant metal bucket filled with
human body parts and blood and he just
shoot has two cannons for arms that just
shoot blood out
yeah but uh yeah he has a couple lines
and he even gets
a a patented rich evans oh my god in
there
it squeezes it in that's pretty great
but that's the only connection we have
in the film that's the only connection
nobody involved with it has reached out
to us to promote it or review it or
anything but jay
what did you think of cycle gorman i
loved psycho gorman uh i thought it was
hilarious i thought it was i don't want
to say clever but it's very
like a lot of astron six's stuff it's
very
uh what it's kind of paying homage to or
spoofing or referencing
is such a niche kind of sub genre
that's always the case with their stuff
the editor
is a movie i like that is it's a spoof
of italian jallo films
and it would be incomprehensible to
someone that is unfamiliar with those
type of movies
uh this is a little broader it's very
like 80s 90s
uh kind of like amblin type movies
there's a bit of that
but i thought it was very creative with
all the creatures it was much more
ambitious than i was expecting
because you hear the premise it's called
pg which is funny title
because it's an r-rated violent movie
but pg is a takeoff of vt and it's like
oh what if the kids from e.t
befriended this this giant monster that
destroys planets because he's just pure
evil but alas they are not the kids from
e.t
no which i think is a sticking point for
a lot of people
mainly me no i think that's the thing is
it's it's sort of
the the it's a brother and sister older
brother younger sister
and uh because i i helped rich record
his voiceover for his sequence
and so i saw one scene from the movie
the scene that riches in while i was
helping him record the voice they sent
us a digital file of it
and uh when i saw the little girls
acting my initial reaction was kind of
like oh
pg are these silly little guys your
friends
why don't you introduce us don't look
very friendly
this is our main character this is going
to get uh annoying after a while
but in the context of the movie i
actually thought she was hilarious and i
know other people have said they found
her incredibly annoying
but she's just this like selfish weirdo
that i thought was very funny in like a
cartman way
where carmen's like an annoying little
[ __ ] but he's funny
yeah to me i think
that element and the
the weird kind of humor brought about
from the parents i don't know this
i like this movie a lot i i particularly
like the costumes
of course yes that's the big standout is
the
amazing amazing costumes and creativity
and and the wonderful little back
stories of
all the the time psycho gorman has
destroyed worlds
a lot of world building and mythology
and what is ultimately a really stupid
comedy
which which elevates it it's yeah all
that stuff is super creative and fun
yeah um and i like the idea
of uh little kids on earth befriending
a violent monstrous alien because they
they take it to the limit
he has no redeeming qualities
his backstory kind of gives you a little
bit of understanding of him
yeah he was uh like a slave and uh he
broke free
and yeah but but he's just basically
pure evil
he just goes from planet to planet and
and destroys everyone
he's like a thanos kind of yeah yeah
although thanos is more of an agenda
yeah he's the skin of evil
from the tasha yar death episode
we believe everything in the universe
has a right to exist
notion which i do not share i won't even
bother explaining it um
but yeah he is uh just
an awful awful monster and the dialogue
is so great
and the his voice altering yeah the
costume
the look of the costume is great i saw a
tweet from patton oswalt our our dear
friend
pat oswalt who actually will be
returning for another
episode of best of the worst he had such
a great time before
any other any slumming celebrities like
i'm going to be real
i'm going to connect with the youtube
generation i'm going to go on this
[ __ ] no
this is a [ __ ] nightmare
holy
doing
but uh he he tweeted that you're either
gonna love or loathe
it and i think i'm probably
in the small minority of people that are
in the middle to where i i kind of
i kind of get that humor it's stuff that
we've done before
because i i have a particular taste of
bizarre stretched out
jokes awkward comedy anti-humor
yeah we put plenty of it in our film
space cop we talked about this before
the scene where space cop opens his
refrigerator lock
and it's like a 900 digit combination
and he does it for
10 minutes that's where everybody says
oh this is going to be the movie
well i think i think the problem with
that in space cup is that's a long
stretched out non-joke like it just
keeps going on
but that comes right after speaking of
patton it comes after the patent scene
which is also a scene that goes on way
too long
oh man that never gets old that never
gets old
you have two of them back to back it's
almost like you have to do one or the
other yeah and we went
and did both because we're insane and
indulgent
but in this movie i think they knew
which moments to extend which moments to
to have kind of that that non-sequitur
anti-humor
and which ones to keep the story moving
forward right
certain jokes fell very flat to me
mainly i think with the dad i get
his arc was that he was he was like lazy
and he gave bad advice the scene where
he gives the bad advice is pretty funny
well that's that that's right out of
something we would do yeah because
it's taking the whole movie is taking
these kind of 80s and 90s
movie tropes very like conventional
story beats and just turning it up to
absurdity
right right um and so i liked some of
that stuff but then there's
certain things that just stood out like
him eating the chicken
overcooking the chicken well he just
cooks the chicken in the microwave
yeah everyone's like it's kind of tough
right and so
like i don't know and then it's like
awkward silence
there's one particular scene that i was
really expecting them to
to drag out and i probably would have
laughed was the scene where
psycho gorman realizes the sister is
awful
and he he feels like he can align
himself with the brother
oh yeah the the cemetery dreams yeah the
the only way he could talk to the
brother is in his nightmares
which there's zombies there because why
not the kid's having a nightmare and his
bed is in a graveyard and they're
zombies
oh this is the only place i could talk
to you and so the kid turns down his
offer to betray the sister and give him
the gem that controls him um that they
dig up in their backyard
yeah and then um he's like so what
happens now he said
we have to wait till your dream is over
do you wake up one two cut
yeah i was really surprised that didn't
get dragged out just cut to that wide
shot for an extended period
of time with these zombies moaning right
and then you just just leave it yeah you
just leave that camera on and i love
stuff like that
and then i also love bait and switches
or double reverse bait and switches i'm
okay with
the uh there's a scene where uh psycho
gorman
kills the paladins the his old
team yeah and one of them is like a
witch
doctor like a sorcerer and she gets her
head cut off
but the head is like rolling down the
street and it's still alive and it's
like i'm i
may have nobody but i can start over
with my head and then
here comes the pickup truck perfect
setup for a bait and switch and they
didn't do it yeah
that was a miss i mean it's i mean humor
more than anything else is so subjective
especially a movie like this where
there's so many different types of humor
it's hard to
it's hard to like pinpoint what works
and what doesn't
because it's going to be different for
everybody yeah
most of it worked for me there's a
couple moments like that didn't work but
a lot of it did yeah and we've also also
talked a lot about what we've dubbed the
chad vader effect
we haven't yet come up with a better
term for it
there's an old web series called chad
vader which i think was made in
wisconsin yeah madison yeah um and so
the joke is that there's
a guy named chad vader who looks and
sounds just like darth vader and
he does wacky things he works in a
grocery store weak-minded fool
your powers are nothing compared to
anything later dial 5 for vomit cleanup
chad to aisle 5 for vomit
so so the the concept is when you take a
dark imposing figure and you
do wacky things it's instantly funny
right um
similar to fish out of water humor when
someone's taken out of their element
uh and put in some a different element
where they don't understand it
instant funny so lots of instant funnies
with psycho gorman um he mostly sticks
to a serious character though which
helps a lot yeah
they don't push him too far into the
goofy stuff there's one moment that
works perfectly because they don't do it
a whole lot
which is when the the little girl mimi
is her name and she they're just like
they're having him stay at this
warehouse because they don't know what
to do with them
and she's just giving him things to like
give them like a tv stuff to
do so he's not bored she gives him a
magazine and there's a like a shirtless
dude in it
and just this light of like i don't care
for hunky boys
and then he starts to question his
sexuality
that low angle shot when he looks down
yeah yeah do i
that's perfect because they don't do too
many moments like that yeah
i do not care for hunky boys
most of the time he's dark and imposing
and the humor comes more from the
contrast between him and the kids he's
telling these
long elaborate stories about his his
journeys throughout the galaxy
and they just couldn't give a [ __ ]
they're bored they're at a diner at one
point he starts to tell the story we
start to go into the flashback and they
just completely cut him off
yeah and that stuff's fun i think
the the formula of the
the dark imposing figure being
controlled by kids
who are relatively oblivious
to his powers is great um
like uh i think a lot of people out
there
the the problem comes in with the little
girl
and this is where you tread lightly
because
the little girl is a real person who's
in a movie
who probably sees lots of comments about
how she's terrible
it's not her fault she did her best
it's the direction and the writing so
yeah
you don't want to dog on the little kid
but
that's where that's that was the
sticking point for me is
i didn't find her endearing or funny
i found her grating and annoying and
it's a tricky thing like i thought she
was hilarious but it's a tricky
thing where like you can say that and i
can counter it with well that's the
point
and it's like well is that enough to
justify it for me it did
i like the con because i think you would
like it if they were more
just straight good kids throughout the
whole thing right well you have to
it's a yin yang kind of thing it has to
balance out
and when you tip the scale like if the
parent
you don't want it to be dull but it the
parents are eccentric and weird
and the kids are also eccentric and
weird and then you contrast them with
the dark imposing monster like you know
you're we're thinking like
movies there's a lot of movies like this
where a thing
harry and the hendersons you know your
ets
um i guess mac and me i've never seen it
have you seen e.t i've seen anything
seen mac and me although i should point
out there's a much darker alternate
ending to this film that was not seen in
u.s theaters and we're going to show a
clip from it right now
they don't know how to drive anyway
yeah so if mimi was more of a gertie
where she like really liked to dress up
psycho gorman in a costume i mean
there's a scene in et where
e.t wears a lady's clothes a little tea
party she has a tea party with e.t
there's a 90s changing clothes montage
in this movie there is a
a montage which is pretty fun
i mean that's fair to me it worked
because you have the older first of all
i like that it's the older brother and
the younger sister is the one that's
kind of the the alpha between the two
she's the one bossing him around
which is a nice little twist but i i
think that that
he's the one that balances that out
where he's just super normal kid
to the point where cycle gorman can
never remember his name which is a funny
running gag
that's funny but the the idea that this
this
i i liked her delivery i liked how
bratty she was because she's just such a
like selfish weirdo
and she's like the worst kid that could
possibly
take control of psycho gorman and so i
think that adds like i think if it was
played more straight where the two kids
are just normal
like amblin kids i i think the movie
would run out of steam
and i think the way it is it kind of
keeps the story from getting dull
or from the joke from running out
because it could easily become a one
joke movie
and if i if i did have my biggest
complaint about the movie is
the third act takes place almost
entirely in that warehouse
which is a boring location and it wears
out its welcome because it's like the
last half hour we're stuck in that place
i just think i think the movie excelled
in nerdy creativity
but lagged behind in
the art and artistry
of properly balancing the joke
i think as far as it being a
very accessible comedy
it is very cultish and very niche oh
yeah i think
the reason that is the case is because
um
of the the inability to make it
accessible to
all audiences in in the premise
yeah um and it wasn't as like
horrifically gory and over the top as i
was expecting
no there's some stuff early on he rips
off some people's heads
there's the guy that he basically frees
he doesn't kill him
he makes him just like live in constant
agony where his eyes are rolling around
in his head
i think the most disturbing thing was uh
when they plucked a random human from
earth and put her in the cube
oh yeah yeah weird stuff like that
that's where the movie excels yeah but
that delicate balance between
how your human characters could act
versus the interaction with the the
spacey
science fictiony parts is is a very very
careful balancing act and i think they
were a little too indulgent and let's
make the dad say weird things let's make
the mom
do this let's make the little girl crazy
we also have just playing off of
conventions and then yeah which is a
that's why like it reminded me a lot of
like which is which is a form of parody
yeah i suppose uh but like like the
david wayne what had american summer
where it's like if you if you don't get
specifically the type of like tropes
that they're kind of poking fun at
then it completely falls apart and this
this is similar to me
to something like a wet out american
summer where it's like you really have
to be dialed
in to what they're doing or it just
comes across
completely nonsensical sure definitely
the what hot american summer test
uh that's of course a movie that i love
that i laugh
one of the funniest movies ever made um
like the we're going into town
they binge on heroin and things go out
of control and they come back an hour
later and everything's fine
the guys stand stand-up routine at the
end
um yeah so killed me [ __ ] jesus
christ was my camp counselor
you laughed so hard i couldn't breathe
i went to camp so long ago that [ __ ]
jesus christ was my counselor
and my best friend hadn't fully evolved
yet
there were two epidemics when i went to
camp head lice
and the plague the bubonic plague
but that's a case where i don't know
what you would call that because it's
not what he's saying that's funny
it's the fact that it's the fact that
it's not funny and it just keeps going
on and everybody's laughing hysterically
this is a form of anti-human it's a yeah
it's a play on conventions
right um anti-humor i love yeah
um have you watched tim heidecker's
stand-up
we saw tim heideker stand up no no
there's a new special
that's on youtube oh no i don't know
what it's called
when we saw him he's playing like an
angry coked up comic which was funny
um but he has a new new stand-up that's
virtually
all um anti-humor and
um he's he's playing more like forgetful
and awkward
and just bad at being a stand-up like
like the opening is him coming out
and uh like like doing the
comedic thing hey everybody how are you
doing and then he knocks over the
microphone
and then for like maybe a good five
minutes it's him
futzing around trying to fix the
microphone and then getting so
mad that he storms off stage um
and so you know there i am laughing
hysterically at that um
so i love anti-humor i love strange
humor
but it's it's one of those weird things
that can't specifically be defined
sure your case you found the little girl
hilarious
me i found it grating
and out of place and annoying sure and
then some of the things towards the end
we always talk about setups and payoffs
for example the hunky guy
yes hunky guy magazine or i don't care
about hunky guys
or do i funny
then later during the battle somebody
rips accidentally rips the hunky guy
magazine and he said not my hunky guy
didn't work what are you doing there
it works as a one-off it works as a
one-up yeah and then
um uh i guess bringing up the song
they play that rock song yeah and then
at the end
she starts singing it a slow version
of that rock song it's supposed to be
like a a joke i'm like an emotional
even though everything is completely
nonsensical this song is stupid it was
it was a
that was a play on what is a cliche
in those kinds of movies but for me i
was like that rock song was
so long ago i don't even remember so
my brain was like what is she singing
best
yeah yeah yeah
freak all the rest
yeah yeah yeah and now
if if uh the first act of the movie was
the little kids
trying to win the battle of the bands at
their junior high school and they
practiced this song a lot and they all
worked on it together
psycho gorman was giving them advice on
lyrics how about the next verse goes
slaughter those who are weaker than you
no no no psycho gorman
let's change it and we really worked on
that song
then you bring that song up at the end
and then it perks psycho gorman's
attention
they remember that moment but really it
happened in a montage as a joke
it felt like a one-off joke because then
it's brought up at the end as an
emotional arc
i mean you could really like you could
analyze this film in terms of
comedy and why things work and why they
don't
and and and they could work for some
people not for the
others so i think what we're saying is
if you actually liked
space cop you'll probably like this film
and if you didn't like space cop you'll
probably like this film
yes jay this is a a noteworthy day the
first
film we've reviewed that has had
one of our own in it
kind of kind of yeah kind of very very
small part but
rich did do a voice and if i were a true
sleazy dirtbag ass kisser i would
probably say this film's great everybody
check it out
but i didn't give my honest opinion i
liked a lot of it
uh some stuff was was cringy and didn't
work
um but i certainly enjoyed all of the
the creativity and all that kind of
stuff put into it and
old school miniatures and stop motion
yeah every every trick in the book
yeah which visually has its charm it
doesn't look real
it's not like slick effects but they
look great for what they're supposed to
be
all that stuff that that you and i uh
have done before
that really we both really like like
that really kind of dark
twisted humor just for some reason a
good chunk of it didn't quite work for
me but
a lot of it did so yeah i probably
recommend it
mainly because our audience kind of
shares the same humorous
humor style that we do yeah also um it
is a movie that
uh i haven't seen anything like it
that's yeah that's the final positive
for me is that it's just completely
original and different
yeah there's a new garden town
and his name
psycho gorman
it was nice meeting you it would be
nicer if you were dead
all right bye
