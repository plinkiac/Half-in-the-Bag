Half in the Bag.
Mike: You know what's really great?
Mike: Old Star Trek.
Mike: Huh.
Mike: Who would have thought a book where the X-Men meet Star Trek: The Next Generation characters would be so well-written?
Mike: This must be in the upper echelon of literature.
Mike: Speaking of Star Trek: The Next Generation, I recently saw the trailer for Star Trek: Picard season two.
Mike: Boy, oh, boy, does it look like shit.
Mike: Of course, they dredge up Q.
Mike: It just looks terrible.
Mike: I don't even know why they made a season 2 of Star Trek: Picard.
Mike: The first season sucked so bad.
Mike: Who's watching season two, even?
Mike: You know, I read an article that said Paramount+ did a survey of all of its viewers, and only one percent of its active subscribers said they were interested in a Picard season two.
Mike: And with Star Trek: Discovery season three, they counted up all the viewers, and only 6,000 people viewed Star Trek: Discovery season three.
Mike: Not one episode, mind you.
Mike: The entire season.
Mike: 6,000 views.
Mike: Jesus, I wish they would just stop making these new crappy Star Trek series.
Mike: You know what's really great?
Mike: Old Star Trek, like TOS, TNG, VOY, DS9, and even ENT.
Mike: ENT stands for Enterprise.
Mike: It's shorthand.
Mike: Those are all shorthands for the tv series.
Mike: You know, I was thinking of doing another Star Trek: The Next Generation video with Rich.
Mike: But, how about this, Jay?
Mike: Why don't you do it with me?
Mike: You could watch every episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and rank your favorite ones.
Mike: You know which ones are my favorite?
Mike: "Yesterday's Enterprise."
Mike: "Disaster."
Mike: "The Best of Both Worlds," part one and two.
Mike: "Tapestry."
Mike: "The Inner Light."
Mike: "Future Imperfect."
Mike: "Conundrum," of course."
Mike: "The Price."
Mike: "Hero Worship."
Mike: "The Pegasus."
Mike: "First Born."
Mike: "Time's Arrow," part one and two.
Mike: Those are pretty good.
Mike: "The Outcast."
Mike: "Cause and Effect."
Jay: Hey, Mike.
Jay: Do you want to talk about a surreal, violent, obscure, art house horror film with me?
Mike: That, instead of Star Trek?
Mike: Well, I'd love to, Jay.
Mike: Let's talk all day about this disgusting, putrid, uncomfortable, filthy movie.
["This depiction is dangerous."]
["Come on, Enid."]
["I'm cutting it."]
Jay: After viewing a strangely familiar video nasty, Enid, a film censor, sets out to solve the past mystery of her sister's disappearance, embarking on a quest that dissolves the line between fiction and reality.
well jay i won't ask what
you thought of this film
no one has to uh and
let me throw in a quick backstory here i
caught the trailer
on vudu the poster intrigued me
uh it's a lady uh addressed in the 80s
style very conservatively on the upper
half of the poster
the bottom half she's holding an axe
sensor
and that breaking image in a way posters
usually aren't anymore
correct that when you're scrolling
through like itunes or whatever
yeah it's just close-ups of bruce
willis's face every thumbnail is just
brilliant
early nissan someone's punching somebody
but yeah i was intrigued by the poster
it had the
i don't know i think the font was 80s
carpenter us halloweenish
stranger things throwback font what's
this
watch the trailer very interesting this
looks right up jay's alley this looks
like he
made this movie or this movie was made
for him so i watch the film
and then i take a airplane
i fly to las vegas to place my bet on
whether or not jay
has seen this film the sports book
everybody that was a buzz
with activity um the odds were 900
trillion to one
that jay has watched this film it just
came out by the way
i should point that out you were already
it's just not for like a day
it came out uh two days yeah one day it
was on streaming video and
and it wasn't obviously wasn't
advertised they don't advertise the
movies anymore you gotta go find them
and so i was like jay has seen this
movie jay have you seen
before i could say sentient of course
i've seen something
um and so i say why don't we talk about
censor well mike i thought this movie
was terrible
no i loved this movie uh uh visually
it's it's fantastic the cinematography
the lighting
um you can call it a throwback i guess i
mean it's clearly influenced by a lot of
italian 70s 80s stuff with the
the garish lighting um but
it has a story that holds your interest
it's not just
weird visuals that get tiresome right
and well that's where i will
slightly disagree um real quick i
i really liked this movie i
respected it i appreciated it many
things i liked about it
again this is a u-movie and
not so much a me movie but it kind of
i kind of fell over the line a little
hang on so jay before we get into our
discussion of sensor we'd like to
first say this will be filled with
spoilers which
may uh affect your enjoyment of the film
but we're gonna ruin it all yes uh and
and so we're gonna say right now
i would recommend the movie jay strong
recommendation yeah okay okay um
and before we start talking about it
this is probably we should probably do
this all the time
i would imagine right um because it in
talking about how the movie is
structured
it may spoil your enjoyment as things
develop in the movie so yeah
heads up we're going to talk about
sensor a movie
we we both enjoy so maybe watch it first
and then come back and watch our review
or don't do whatever you'd like
and of course jay would recommend this
film because it's a weird
perverted horror film the film
is about our main character enid plays
a british sensor during the era of
the video nasty yes uh which we'll
discuss jay will
tell you all about this you know i'll
tell you way more than you need to know
um but this is in the conservative 80s
the the margaret thatcher era the the
satanic panic
that was the kind of the the us
equivalent
british columbia moral panic moral yeah
the the
the the age of tipper gore and the um
you know parental advisories and we got
to start raiding things and
um the rating system came about the
censorship came about we're talking
about
scenes that are really horrific and
leave nothing to the imagination
mutilations of bodies cannibalism gang
rape
that is what a video nasty is but uh our
main character
plays a british sensor who has a
troubled past
and and it's a mixture of
her mental breakdown and
the art imitating life and
uh the line blurring between what she
sees is reality and what's movie or
fantasy
or horror yes and in a lynchy and
kind of disturbing way uh
well it reminded me of like enemy the
jake gyllenhaal movie
specifically because that's a movie
where you're like the mystery
is so sort of bizarre and surreal which
in that movie it's
he runs a movie and sees himself in the
movie basically and he gets obsessed
with tracking down like what is this who
is this person
and this is similar where uh the the
main character she has
like vague memories of her and her
sister in the woods when they were
little
and she doesn't know what happened
sister's been missing for like whatever
it is a decade 15 years now
um but then she's watching a movie that
she's supposed to rate or decide what to
cut and censor
and the movie mirrors her memories of
her and her sister in the woods and so
she gets tangled up in trying to figure
out who made this movie
and it just yeah uh it keeps your
interest in terms of the mystery just
because it's so
kind of slow moving but really like
atmospheric and surreal
speaking of jake gyllenhaal i got some
zodiac vibes i don't know why um
i think it's the i think it was the
setting
the the that kind of dingy disgusting
80s office yeah it's not stranger things
where everything's like 80s
remember how nostalgic and wonderful the
80s are this is like no the 80s were
gross
here it is well i mean yeah you could
portray
the the style the fashion you know a lot
of things are gross about the 80s the
the the treatment of women uh is
is brought up in this a lot
brutalization of women
kind of people aggressively hitting on
her the the
the sleazy movie producer you know that
sort of
you know the sexism of the 80s and and
and but also visually how it's depicted
as like
the smoky disgusting dingy i just got
that newsroom
feel of zodiac and yeah wasn't jake
gyllenhaal so in
is it nightcrawler yeah that also is
kind of similar
vibes sort of seedy and yeah disgusting
greenish tint to everything yeah
and that had a video video angle to it a
little bit
he would go out and film
oh yeah our main character uh she has a
past where her
sister went missing when she was younger
it's all very
ambiguous in terms of like what happened
what the parents really know yes i kind
of got that vibe
um and her obsession with finding her
sister
uh and and that's what the trailer
leads you in okay see i didn't even
watch the trailer okay
watching the trailer i'm like i love
this i love how this stage is set
a a british sensor who's censoring
horror films
uh kind of gets wrapped up in this whole
storyline of trying to find her missing
sister and she sees an actress in a
horror film
who she believes to be her missing
sister all grown up
held hostage by the film company yeah
forced to act in the gtb movies the girl
in the movie is being tortured and
tormented so that must be real it just
goes down this track of
trying to track down these sleazy
filmmakers yeah and so
i'm like oh i i kind of like that
premise
that's probably really not her sister
that would be to
lame that kind of plot of her uncovering
and rescuing her sister but
but that narrative part of my brain
wanted that answer
but then you know halfway through the
movie
i mean it's not like your typical
structured movie where
you know i was expecting 30 minute mark
is when
she discovers her sister in the movie
but it doesn't come until like an hour
later
yeah it's very slow to build its
atmosphere yeah
and it's more of like a character study
because you see her with her parents and
like
her parents just want to move on they
try and they show her the
death certificate or like we just want
to end this and she's just so determined
that her sister's still out there
somewhere yeah so after a while began to
realize it was more focused on her
mental decay and and spiral downward
into
into madness basically um and i was
happy
without having a clear outcome of the
premise
i was happy with an ambiguous ending it
has a yeah it's
ambiguous but at the same time uh
what's literally happening is pretty
clear-cut but it's ambiguous about the
sister angle
yeah which which i like right right
this is really nice nina my sister
there's a lot of subjects the movie's
trying to tackle you know it
past trauma uh she keeps doing a thing
with
oh yeah that was like the most
horrifying thing in the movie she's like
scratching like
if you've ever had a hangnail or if
you've ever ripped off skin next to your
your fingernail and clearly that's like
a tick
yeah that's like surfacing um but she's
some kind of past trauma that's
that's buried so that kind of parallels
with you know editing
out things from a movie yes it's a very
metaphorical
you know and it's yeah she mentions that
at one point like the idea of like
editing out memories
and uh there's a uh
because again this takes place during
the video nasty era the censorship era
and there's a
a story of a guy that's killed his
wife and daughter is that what it was he
ate his wife's face
yeah oh that's it yeah he he ate her
face which parallels a movie that
their sensor board let's slip past so
now all these people are outraged and
blaming them
i think people see that disgusting film
you should be ashamed of yourself
the the guy says he doesn't remember
doing it and she's like well how could
you not remember doing that so you have
the parallel between her missing
memories and the missing memories of
someone that they're blaming the violent
movies on
like all that that it's ironic she has a
past memory that she has removed from
her brain and she's the one removing
stuff from films why do you think he
can't remember
it could be basic trauma brain it sort
of
shuts it out but what really happened
she didn't really
kill her sister with an axe i assume
maybe she did maybe she did but then
yeah they kept showing like
they kept showing a man in the woods
like disgusting
creepy man who kind of paralleled the
beastmen character
yeah um so i don't know uh is she
inventing the past
memory of her sister based on what she's
watching
it it's never really clear-cut well and
it's kind of morally ambiguous this
isn't
just i mean clearly i think the
filmmakers are
uh against the side of the british
sensors and censoring movies and
everything sure
but her being exposed to all this stuff
to have to take notes and censor it is
sort of what helps spiral her
mental state out of control so i like
that ambiguity there of not just being
so
kind of clear-cut and simplistic now you
say filmmakers
filmmaker prano bailey bond
british filmmaker this is her first
feature
length film she did a short film called
nasty which is
a shorter version of this movie it's
like i think it won awards and
i think it was quite a while ago several
years but then now this is a
feature-length version of that
uh only 84 minutes too yeah that was
kind of a nice
i mean it's perfect like for this story
right if it got on too long you'd start
to feel that
that pacing but the uh
they do a stylistic thing which i didn't
notice until it already happened which
is
in the third act very very gradually the
aspect ratio
over the course of like 15 minutes
starts to go into that four by three
which is of course when she's watching
these movies on vhs that's kind of how
she's viewing them is four by three
so but it happened so i didn't even like
at one point as i was like oh when did
that happen
so i went and rewound it and then like
fast rewind you see it go like
but it's it's so gradual and it's like
that that ratcheting of tension
that losing that grip on reality
closing your hands closing in like it
represents all these things it's not
just like a pointless stylistic thing
her slowly going into the movie
spiraling downward and entering a movie
in her own head
and i think that's more when they start
to introduce like the the the more kind
of stylish
stylish lighting the red lighting and
stuff is more in the
is this real or is this not kind of
aspects of the movie
right yeah there's there's this very
specific point in this movie where it
takes a sharp
turn to where where it becomes very
clear what's happening
and it's it's the moment she's she's
become obsessed with finding this
actress alice
something lee who's in in the this film
by this director is this very
mysterious enigmatic uh
an auteur of cheap people
so she knows the producer the producer
stopped by the
the film sensor offices and so she finds
his house she shows up at his house
it's raining she looks like a crazy
person
she's trying to track down this actress
and he was hitting on her earlier so he
assumed she came over for a
yes for a little something right and he
offers her scotch and
he's he's a bit of a sleazebag who would
have thought
a film producer the sleazy dirt bag
anyways he uh uh offers her a drink and
he thinks yeah she's there for
ulterior motives but really she's there
for information and then
a struggle occurs and the one moment
that took me way out of the movie
happens here i guess we're in spoilers
so but that's the point
he didn't die in a conventional manner
he died in
a silly b-movie manner yeah
i guess if that was the point it kind of
took me out because it was
especially at that point in hindsight
yeah
it was it was kind of perfect because
then then it's like
that reality shatters and it
did you know did that really happen i
guess so
if it did that it happened like that
yeah it's a very silly visual and at
that point of the movie
i guess yeah like you said kind of in
hindsight it makes sense but
when it happened i was like oh geez yeah
yeah yeah but
but even still they shoot it in
like in his profile and clearly the
award is on the other side of his face
they didn't even you could make a
prosthetic or uh
an appliance just cut the word in half
stick it in his mouth easy peasy
right um but they shot it like the cheap
way
like you would do with a knife yeah you
have a real all we have is a real knife
well put it on the side of someone's
head and film this way yeah that's
that's how like a bee movie would shoot
it yeah that's true um
and so it was very clearly on the other
side of his head and i thought okay this
is
it it didn't fit the tone and that's
when that's that moment when
everything started to fall apart that
might be when i'd have to go back and
look that might be when the aspect ratio
starts to change it's right
around there somewhere
i was wondering if you had anything else
like this actress
what's gonna happen to her that's top
secret
yeah so it didn't didn't really
you know it's a little slow it's not
conventionally structured as a as like a
as it was portrayed in the trailer like
an investigation movie she's going to
find her missing scissors
i'm sure they make it look super
exciting in the trailer yeah more of a
character study
about um and commentary on
censorship yeah um and how
i don't know it almost if it is an
anti-censorship movie it almost
is self-defeating because the sensor
who's exposed to horrific images
ends up going crazy that's a saying it's
sort of a contradiction but i
i like that ambiguity and it's to me
it's more like because it is a character
study it feels like it's about this
specific person
more so than it's trying to say anything
about censorship as a whole
because all the i mean all the other
characters that work in the censor board
are just doing their jobs and
people because you have some of the
other characters like there's that dude
who he's like i could be working in
academia instead of doing this trash
and so yeah clearly it can affect people
differently and then they have the story
about the guy who ripped the face off
and ate it and then blamed the thing
um but that's an open-ended question i
think
is do can movie violence
and now it's sort of transformed into
like video games like
first-person shooters oh yeah that whole
that whole topic
does does that desensitize younger
people
i i do not believe in censorship
i do believe in rating systems though i
think that's
helpful sure uh you don't want uh an
eight-year-old watching a
violent r-rated movie right i do believe
in some ways that can
warp perceptions of reality for younger
people
and that's why we have rating systems i
think that's a fair compromise
but yeah that's a different thing that's
the difference between
you know the us and the the uk
at that time right as the uk was doing
actual they were taking movies and just
ripping scenes out of them they were i
mean that's the video nasty era
um they didn't have a first amendment
got
our freedom of speech they were yeah i
think it was a list of like
72 movies altogether we have some of
them here
so i have a handful of them right here
not all of them of course there was 72
but it was
the list was 72 movies that were deemed
uh
obscene and pulled from shelves pulled
from video store shelves
uh and then there was a secondary list
of other movies that were not
uh classified as obscene but were still
told to be pulled off of the shelves as
well um so these
these are some of the ones that were
legally classified
they were certified as obscene and
banned and banned
in 1982 under the obscene publications
act
police seized 22 000 cassettes in the
metropolitan area
alone and that's there's that scene in
the movie where she goes to the video
store and the guy's got the
he's got like video nasties kind of
hidden under the counter and that was
really happening
and people got fines for that they got
arrested for that
jay can i say i'm shocked you own so
many video nasties
i find it surprising some of them i
suppose make sense but some are a little
uh
i mean not make sense like i don't think
they should have been banned but where
it's like yeah they're pretty grotesque
island but then you have like evil speak
which has clint howard in it and he
he conjures up satan through a computer
why it's the driller killer driller
killer you see footage of that in the
movie
we watched the sun best of the worst
didn't we no we didn't oh we watched uh
nail gun massacre that might be what
you're thinking about i think we might
have watched driller killer
i would doubt we had ever watched it
because it's actually pretty boring but
that you see that in
uh sensor that's the drill going into
the head i use the clip from it because
that movie's public domain so he's the
clip from it in our trover saves the
universe
hail satan ad the hail satan channel all
satan
all the time scary movies documentaries
but it's funny because that's the like
the only violent shot in that whole
movie
the rest of the movie is just a bunch of
uh new york hipsters hanging out in a
loft
but then there's other ones that are
genuinely pretty grotesque that
i don't i can't justify why i own like
cannibal holocaust
it's unbelievable it's it's horrible
i can't understand the reason for such
cruelty
there's italian oh these italian
cannibal ferox
italian cannibal movies um
i spit on your grave like the most
notorious kind of rape revenge movie
yeah i don't know you probably haven't
seen this movie i'm assuming you've seen
this poster before oh yeah this is a
pretty iconic poster you know who this
is
the model for the posters it was demi
moore really yeah
little fun facts i have never seen a
video nasty
i wouldn't i have far too much how can
you judge on a video now
i actually don't need to see
visually what i know is in that film
there's an episode you know the the
great british show the young ones yes of
course
a wonderful show that's filled with
yelling and destruction
uh but there's a video nasty episode of
that
it's a video nasty a punk band
on the episode performs a song about the
video nasties
so yeah it was interesting to see a
movie i've never seen that before i've
seen movies set during like satanic
panic and but the the uk
kind of video nasty era was unique it
was new it was
a different kind of setting or it's in
the 80s but it's not like a
glossy nostalgic right thing it's a
dirty 80s
we're riding on the the london tube
yeah the disgusting people and
yeah it's like um it reminded me like
80s times square you know
yeah like everything's gross and
dangerous
in court a solicitor for the director of
public prosecutions called the material
an extravaganza of gory violence capable
of depraving and corrupting those who
watched it
yeah i i enjoyed this film i don't have
too much more to say about it
uh no it's it's it's a slow burn uh i
love those super slow kind of character
studies there's a movie that came out
earlier this year that it reminded me a
lot of called saint maude have you seen
that i have not watched it that's a a24
movie i was looking forward to watching
that it had a really
it had a really [ __ ] up release where
it wasn't like in
theaters and on vod at the same time it
was direct to
i think stars where it's like you had to
have stars to see it that was the only
place it was
um but that's both of these movies are
like top movies for me this year they're
both really really good
if you're into that kind of like slow
character study
descent into madness kind of stuff um
that one yeah the same with this too
where it just has that that slow
creeping atmosphere where it really gets
under your skin
you like that movie with scarlett
johansson
avengers age of ultron
what why age of ultron because it sounds
stupider i'm making it under the skin
job
oh oh oh oh you
finally caught on that's another great
movie under the skin
but anyway no i love the style of this
movie the uh
they show actual movies like like i
mentioned driller killer i think there's
some other ones in there but then
the stuff that they created for the
movie is very like it's a mix of like
evil dead
and italian stuff with the with the
lighting
i thought that was really well done just
yeah really well
well put together movie a lot of
attention to detail uh
but not real thick on the murder mystery
plot
well it is until it isn't it kind of
changes on a dime i i i
really like the ending though when she's
gone full
cracked and uh i think it's foreshadowed
in the
one of the boxes she picks up it's like
so something like a
a wonderful happy place or there's a
there's a
box of vhs box that mimics the end shot
oh look at parents i think i missed that
that very end shot where it's like all
scenic
and perfect and then it keeps
interconnecting those glitches of vhs
with her screaming for help that
made my [ __ ] skin crawl yeah it's so
perfectly done
so that's where it becomes like it's
almost surreal where it's like
is this a loop is this all playing out
in her head even though it parts in
reality and who knows
and is the implication that she did
murder her sister with an axe when she
was a kid
we don't know the parents are are happy
to cover it up
or they don't know or they don't know
yeah and uh
and and she's that's why she became a
film sensor
she was traumatized by that incident
when she was a child
i guess we don't know specifically what
happened but
hey not every every movie can be
fast and a furious nine
i was promised that was going to be in
space
is that true i remember seeing articles
saying the next fast and furious movie
will be in space
and i thought god damn that's so awesome
i may watch that one
like we're bringing a bunch of uh
expensive uh
sports cars up to the international
space station you know
elon musk is testing out his uh his new
space car and uh and then you know you
got vin diesel driving it
out in the outside of the space station
smashing it up and
i mean maybe they they take the cars way
up into like the upper
upper atmosphere you know and then they
drive them out you know
maybe where the cars are in a big plane
in like super low orbit and they
have like oxygen masks on and they
jump the cars out of the thing i was so
excited
but i don't i didn't see any space
well you probably want to save that i'm
still wondering why paul walker left the
movies
when is he coming back he's kind of in
space
he's up in heaven with the jesus
people think that i create horror
aura is already out there so jay would
you recommend uh
sensor absolutely of course you would
unless you're not into this kind of
slow character study stuff but i i
really loved it
yeah i would recommend it as well uh
knowing full well when you go into it
it's not going to be the murder mystery
the trailer promised
it's going to be a sit back and
enjoy the creepy atmospheric kind of
film which aren't always my favorites
it has to have just enough story to keep
keep it moving
yeah or it doesn't get too lost in
abstractions
right and that then that comes across in
a lot of the
you know the reviews or comments you
know
great movie until the [ __ ] ending
when it sucked you know that's right oh
really
i like the ending of this yeah well
because it's it's ambiguous
yeah i don't i feel like it gives you
enough
i mean i guess if you're really invested
in the sister stuff
but i think it's not really it ends up
not really being about her so much
i know jay i know and i don't put myself
in the dumb people category but dumb
people
want a conclusion to a story
smart people like subtext
and character building and maybe
even an ambiguous ending that leaves you
thinking
right and i'm not generalizing but i'm
generalizing
um so the dummies want an answer i guess
that's another way they killed the
sister and that's me that's exactly i
said who killed the sister
but then my smart half of my brain said
