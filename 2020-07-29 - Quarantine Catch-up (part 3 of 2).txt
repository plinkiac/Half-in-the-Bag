half in the bag.
A fucking goat can review movies better than these assholes.
so this is weird boomer this is called a book
i've been reading lots of these lately
because i've run out of new movies to watch
that's true that's true
we've been stuck inside the vcr repair shop for almost a month now
you know what fucking movie won't leave my life is trolls world tour
it's the most popular film of the year
what do you expect
so that was a movie that came out right as
the pandemic started and i think it was
the first thing they put on streaming
media
and that was like in like february
and it's like the top thing in the red
box it's when you go to like
amazon or voodoo or any streaming
service it's trolls world tour trolls
world tour you go into a store they've
got blue rays of them from
florida ceiling i think trolls world
tour is still around because
people have been quarantining for so
long but now they're already nostalgic
for it
oh yeah it's now hip to watch it days
feel like weeks
and so people feel like like that oh
that movie i watched that when i was a
little kid yeah trolls world tour
10 year olds go and revisit it to relive
their their
their nine-year-old childhood mm-hmm
yeah that makes sense
but uh so we've been uh
keeping track of movies movies are like
they're like ghosts they're they're like
they're like a like some kind of specter
that you have to hunt down they don't
they don't tell you when movies come out
you watch a trailer for a movie that
that's a 2020 film
like the trailer was released at the end
of 2019 it's like
april 2020. then you go and look it up
and it's like
delayed forever or or something just
came out
and there's no way to know when it came
out or where it's at
yeah and so i hadn't heard of it it just
shows up one day it just changes
and there's netflix originals hulu
originals
and then you have a movie like new
mutants which is like the white whale
one day we'll catch it oh it's
disappeared again
it's been on the proverbial shelf for a
decade
uh but then you have movies that are
fairly well
advertised like palm springs which we'll
talk about was that well advertised
because that was when i had heard about
until it showed up on hulu and then
everyone was just like
going gaga for it i saw several promoted
like
things for it on twitter and stuff like
that so and then um yeah it was all over
hulu and um
i think in terms of a bigger streaming
movie it was
sort of well promoted alongside that
that racist will feral movie
where he's oh the eurovision eurovision
yeah which
way yeah get me to watch that even in
quarantine right
right i'd rather have corona virus
i'd rather watch paint dry i'm going to
go out on a limb and say that will
ferrell talks in a funny voice and yells
a lot
sure yeah i'm going to scrub through it
i'm going to pull it up on netflix
and i'm going to scrub through it and
i'm just going to whatever i land on i'm
gonna play the clip right now
i can't take this shit.
okay
okay
it's like this much shit
i know
i can maybe take this much shit
but it's up here
it's a lot of shit
shit
boom
oh he was yelling
anyway uh so we're digging around and we discover little gems
so this show is called little gems
and everything except one is a movie
that came out this year yeah technically
i'm assuming some of them played film
festivals and stuff last year i know
that palm springs said it played at
sundance
yeah so so yeah movies that haven't been
released until this year
uh wide released although no movies are
wide released anymore
nope so um actually they're released as
wide as they can be they're just on the
internet
i i i honestly think my prediction for
the future will come true
they'll be they'll be disney buildings
that's where you go and see disney
buildings or whatever
whoever whatever conglomerate owns
everybody else
yeah the only holdouts that aren't
disney related are christopher nolan and
quentin tarantino
that still like severely support like
the theatrical experience right
maybe spielberg maybe a little and james
cameron
oh god he's all blue in the face over
his avatar
nightmare he's going to be dead by the
time avatar 16 comes out
like what a disaster did they start
shooting avatar too
i know that it got on hold because of
coronavirus i have no idea
but um he's going to be in a grave
before
his avatar dreams are ever achieved if
they are
new mutants will come out before avatar
too
yeah exactly what are you going to wear
3d goggles in your house
you're going to knock over your beer on
your couch
you know what i mean like what are you
what sorry
nobody cares about 3d anymore james
cameron i'm so so sorry
anyway so here we are we watched
four feature films well i watched five
four of them are ones that we both have
watched yes and i have one i just wanted
to mention briefly because i don't think
it's gonna be around for much longer but
it's called gremlins a puppet story
and it's a very bizarre release it's
it's
hollywood the hollywood theater in
portland
so it's on their website you go there
and you click on the buy a ticket thing
and you can
stream it right from their website i
don't know why that one specific theater
has it
um but it's chris waitlist who did all
the effects for gremlins
and it's it's not really a documentary
but it's feature length it's like 90
minutes
and it's almost all just raw vhs footage
of him the the kind of trial and error
of creating all the creatures and the
puppets for gremlins
just tons and tons of like behind the
scenes footage that has never been seen
anywhere
and him kind of narrating over it well
that answers my question of
what exactly are you masturbating to
these days
but if you're big into gremlins it's
worth checking out i will definitely
check this out but i think
it's weird it's only streaming on their
website for like a week or two weeks and
then i have no idea what's going to
happen to it why would they
have a time limit i don't know and why
on this one
movie theater in one city's website it's
very weird
so i'm hoping after this is it literally
playing in the movie theater or no it's
just
movie theater's open you can just stream
it on their website
um but it's yeah it's it's it shows like
the original design for the mogwais and
how they were like a darker shade
of brown and then spielberg was like
make it look like my dog
and so they at the last minute they had
to change all the colors they had to
refer them
and just see how all this like test
footage of them trying out different
you know tearing techniques it's
fascinating if you're big into gremlins
and it's all stuff like i said i don't
think has ever been seen before
nice so nice
see this is what i would like this is
what i google around for like
movies that came out this year and i
find like lists you know with a shrug
emoji next to it yeah yeah yeah yeah
it's like it's like a bunch of movies
came out
here's a oh delayed delayed oh yeah it
might be out and i
look it up is it out did they just
release it is this article
outdated you know is this release date
still accurate
like it's just a mess yes um so
here we go our first movie is
i spun the roulette wheel j you dropped
the ball what
what movie are we talking about first oh
god uh let's talk about horse girl first
sure and what is it that you're
experiencing
been having a little trouble sleeping
finding myself places and i don't know
how i got there
uh horse girl which premiered on netflix
earlier this year
yeah and i accidentally at first watched
a different horse girl
i thought allison brie oh my god your
career
and then i was oh my ah and i changed it
to the right horse girl well that sounds
like a very comical situation
it was especially i was watching it with
my grandmother
the weird thing is she told me to leave
it on
i thought you just say she said how did
you find my old home movies
horse girl kind of sci-fi i guess we're
talking about two movies that are both
dealing with mental illness
that's a one a horror film on a sci-fi
film kind of
both very low key as far as their genres
go
they're more uh character studies and
more about mental illness
than anything but this one is
alison brie she starts to see things
that she
recognizes from her dreams and she
starts to think that maybe she was
abducted by aliens
and her life starts falling apart yeah
allison brie
uh gives a fantastic performance in this
um i i i was always sort of like blah on
her
uh i knew her from mad men oh that's
right she was on madman i was gonna say
the same time she was on mad men she was
on community
and i really liked her own community i
never watched community she's good on
glow the netflix show i didn't watch
that because i'm not a pervert
um but yeah she's really good in this
movie i would say she elevates the movie
oh yeah the movie didn't quite click for
me no yeah
it kind of felt like uh because the
whole idea it's one of those movies
where it's like oh is
is what she seen is that reality or is
she losing her mind
and it leaned so far into the
she's crazy
he's a god of technology and the aliens
need to appease him okay
they come at night they come at night
when everything's off and it's that day
like it's not daylight it's electricity
it's a detriment to the movie but it's a
testament to her acting that she's so
good
in the film but i i never bought that
what was happening never
it never felt to me like oh this could
possibly be real it always just felt
like oh she's going crazy to me
yeah well i mean but those that that
slow
spiral down is great and all the
situations
that that are intertwined with it sure
and
until like about halfway through is when
she kind of starts to go really off the
rails
and that's that's where the movie lost
me a little bit but the the subtler
stuff in the first half i thought really
worked
um no i i'd love the movie and
uh questionable on the ending
um because this is a duplass
brothers produced film this horse girl
movie is very similar to another
duplass brothers movie called uh safety
not guaranteed
have you ever seen that i saw back when
it came out i barely remember it now
the whimsical uh kind of crazy people
and a time travelly kind of plot that
that was a little more lighthearted
though right
a little more it's pretty dark yeah um
but everybody in this is great
um especially allison brie she meets
oh and the roommate too see there's like
lots of little touches
where like that that's not character of
of her roommate you know
you'd think she'd be like like like this this vapid bitchy character who was just like rude
but she was actually like concerned and
kind and
super rational rational yeah and so when
alison brie starts doing kind of
weirder stuff she's more just kind of
confused by it
why did you bring over a plumber to tear
up the floor yeah yeah
and so i like that that it was felt very
genuine
a lot of the stuff in it and then her
spiral down and when she just starts to
do like
that moment when the other characters
are like what
is there also a test um like to see if
i'm a clone
uh i'm sorry i'm just a test to see if
i'm like a clone
oh david paymer our first appearance of
david paymer on this episode
he comes back but david paymer's like
the way he
uh reacts and and answers her questions
is very doctor-like you know and it's
not like a typical movie where they
emphasize that oh she's clearly crazy
right right he's trying to play it cool
yeah he plays it cool and then there's a
little moment where he kind of realizes
that
oh she's serious and um
he's like have you ever considered maybe
talking to someone
he's very professional very doctor and
and i love that i love when they don't
do cliches and they don't
play it up for you know the the the
silliness of the whole situation her
asking about being a clone
it's played very straight and her her
insane
streak is is truly crazy
i didn't know her she was gone before i
was born so maybe they would have needed
her body to like recycle it into me if i
was a clone of
her and i don't know who would be doing
it
but it's it feels grounded in a
realistic world and and then it spirals
out of control
well and then well now we'll talk about
the ending so skip here
to jump to our second film on our four
film tier list of films we talk about
on our program that all came out in 2020
except for one of them that did not but
we watched it anyway
correct that's the full title of this
episode that's right
that's it jay so skip
here to jump to our next film if you
want to watch horse girl
so the end of the film alice and bree's
gone off the rails
yes and uh she thinks she's being
kidnapped by aliens
and this is this do you think she's been
abducted by aliens which ties in with
time travel and she thinks she's her own
grandma
yes yes and so when you explain that to
someone
crazy yeah but it turns out to be true
or does it is everything in the end just
in her mind no she vanishes
well are we are we just seeing her
delusions though well okay but the one
thing that you can't explain
are the physical scratch marks that
appear
on her wall and so um and and the
roommate confirms this by
seeing the literal scratch marks on the
wall that's true so um
i i think she did become her own
grandmother and she was
actually being abducted by aliens you
say it's open to interpretation
i say that was my interpretation
that's the whole thing and uh i our our
heroine was justified
she was not just a crazy person because
you know like how are you going to end a
movie like that
yeah it ends up in a straight jacket
that or
you know i thought or you lean even more
into the surrealism
yeah and then you end up with like
because it reminded me of david like
mulholland drive but david lynch which
is like like there's a part in this one
she
she comes back to her apartment and
suddenly her roommate is a different
person
it's a person that she was seen in her
in her dreams and
that's very like mulholland drive-like
but that movie goes off the deep and
into surrealism
right and this it just felt like i said
to me it felt most of the movie like
with her performance and what was
happening
more like she was just crazy so it was
kind of hard it was kind of hard to get
invested so when it got to the end
where like you were saying at the end oh
it felt more like oh it was justified
and this was real
i kind of had lost interest i wasn't as
engaged at that point
there was there was a brief moment like
the movie the movie
works and then for just a little moment
you're in that
like okay come on what's real what's not
like get to it
yeah you answer the question what's
what's is is she
uh is she imagining all this or
uh is is this real answer the question
you built it up enough and there's a
little moment but i love the
the abduction parts she wakes up in her
dreams visually that stuff is cool
yeah there's like like an older man and
then there's a girl
who's wearing like a sub pop records
t-shirt circa
1990s mid-1990s and then later she meets
her in the mental hospital and she's
like i
i was living in 1995 and then all of a
sudden i'm here and everything's
different
and they think i'm crazy and so i think
that further validates the
uh the fact that she was uh abducted and
she did become her own grandmother
because it shows the aliens are playing
with time
i just thought it was a fun concept and
i thought all the performances all the
actors were great all around
i really liked it uh if you're looking
for something other than trolls world
tour
i know it sounds really crazy but it
just feels really real
and no we're not watching the kevin
james movie
becky that's another movie that just
won't leave my
eyesight why are you so adamant about
not wanting to watch that one
i saw the trailer and i'm like i got it
that's got another community cast member
in it joel mchale's in it
speaking of white guys let's talk about
the ultimate white guy
in the whole universe his name is brett
goldman
not to be confused with our friend tim
one person i'd love to have on our show
is brett gelman
because i would sit him right next to
tim higgins
it would be just like that shot in the
movie do you remember at the
the theater company yeah i love this guy
i've seen him in lots of stuff and i
always call him the tim higgins guy
yeah and now i know his name this is
this is the vehicle of all vehicles
for him and uh we're talking about what
we call lemon
they love your look your audition rock
solid
i got a job tomorrow i'm going to new
york for 10 days
what's in new york it's better you stay
lemon uh this is this is our non-2020
movie this came out a few years ago
i think it went direct to hulu so nobody
saw it
yeah 2017 it was probably a festival
thing and then
hulu bought it like on the cheap because
the reviews are not good
uh especially the audience reviews like
cr critically it's a it's a hit or miss
kind of thing
half and half and then the audience well
critically
it's hit and miss then oh god i
i watch this because right up your alley
i well it's
it almost gets there but this is one
that you recommended you're like watch
this movie
lemon i loved it yeah and so i started
watching it and
for the first few minutes i thought you
were trolling me i
hated it at the start uh there's a kind
of funny bit because his character is
like a
like an acting coach and he's he's doing
a a scene with
another community cast member uh gillian
jacobs is in that scene
and michael sarah michael sarah is like
talking about
he's he's criticizing her performance
and he's saying a bunch of things
without saying anything
he's like that's kind of funny i think
you're approaching this
one-dimensionally
it's lacking depth it's thin
it's hollow it's false
it's not ringing
but then it dawned on me that it's like
oh this is gonna be all the characters
through the whole movie
oh no it's you gotta give them
it feels like a wes anderson movie
without any humanity to any of the
characters
um but it did get better as it went
along
not as not as quirkly stylized as a wes
anderson no but the the dry deadpan
delivery of dialogue
and a lot of the dialogue feels really
disconnected from everything
what'd you say hmm
what i didn't say anything
you know it seemed real sad to me
and i know that was the point but still
very depressing
that felt very wes anderson this movie
was just a lovely fever dream
for me um one i
love that guy a a dead pan he's he's
great in this role
i just don't like that that character is
the leader the character is
terrible and he has mental problems this
is another mental illness
i guess they all are yeah um the movie
the movie comes full circle this isn't a
spoiler but the movie comes full circle
you're like lemon what
oh yeah i wanted to mention this and
then the very end of the movie it's the
entire credit sequence is played over
what looks like an actual tow truck
driver coming and picking his car up
that won't start and so you're like okay
lemon
lemon is a term for you non-boomers out
there
and lemon is a term for a car that you
buy that that
doesn't work yes or fails quickly and in
the context of this movie his character
is a lemon
he is a lemon as a human being yes he is
a failure
yeah i mean he's jealous he's vindictive
he uh he's autistic
yeah there's he's socially awkward
he's a lemon um and that's that's what
the movie's about and
i mean this this movie's just batshit
and it's so much fun
um just watching it see i felt i felt
like
the is too detached for me
as far as all those characters are awful
the filmmakers know they're awful
i just like i gotta i need something but
it does come
eventually in the form of the nia long
character
who's the girl he starts dating because
i was like all these characters are
stiff and awkward intentionally but as
like i need something
and then she shows up and she feels like
a real human being and he and he takes
her on a date and they have this
incredibly awkward date they have over
300 dishes we have over 300 dishes
we make it all soy bean it's delicious
curry paste oyster sauce all the herbs
we use are fresh
cabbage salad watercress salad cucumber
sea bass prawn
and that's when it started to turn
around for me because i was like okay
he's the lemon
he feels like the character in like a
romantic comedy where you have your
protagonist that goes on the bad date
yeah and he's that character that they
go on the bad date with he's that
character that's in that one comedy
scene in a
in a grander scale of a movie i don't
know i know where you're going
what if we take that character and make
a whole movie about him
sure and there's another movie called
the baxter
which was written and directed by
michael showalter and he's in it too and
that's a similar idea where it's like
the love interest that's about to marry
the wrong person and then the the right
person comes in
and you know and and sweeps her off her
feet and she leaves the guy at the altar
and that movie is about that character
the guy who gets left at the altar and
so i don't know if that was the
intention with this movie
where it's like oh nia long's the real
protagonist but she's only in a third of
the movie
and we focus on this asshole
i don't know if that was intentional or not but that's that's what i got out of it
and that's when it kind of became more interesting to me
okay
i thought you were gonna conclude that by saying uh that her character never really fully developed by the end which which is true
well no she because she's not the
protagonist of this movie
she's the protagonist of a normal movie
it could have taken a switch where
she kind of like helps him
you know in a way oh no i like that he
just leaves her
he tries to run away with her
grandmother you know wheelchairs
that's the stuff that started to click
with me when he goes to like their
backyard barbecue
and he's like i wasn't told there'd be
accents yes yes yes
all my friends call me gilly any friend
of cleopatra
is a friend of mine i didn't know
there'd be accents
excuse me
that's the stuff that started to make me
laugh oh there's because
because there was finally a character
with some humanity that you could
connect with
yeah and everything else was so smug
that i had a hard time sitting through
it his whole life
is just terrible he's dating judy greer
who
was blind she's blind but i just wanted
to say i don't think
judy greer ever has a day off of work
she's in
everything i just i see judy greer
everywhere she's probably in trolls
world
tour she's in uh one of those blumhouse
hulu movies
yes i saw that uh what is it about a
killer dog
yeah i watched it that's literally all
it is
there's no mystery there's no oh is the
dog actually killing people or is it
something else no
it's killer dog and then the movie just
goes on for another hour yeah but judy
greer has been dating him for
10 years and she's she's totally blind
but she's constantly traveling
it's just funny it's just like i'm i'm
in i'm going to dallas and then
tampa and then over here and i'm leaving
tomorrow and
so she's the she's blind but she's the
one who's just living her life
and then there's that moment when they
break up is that after he
his phone falls in the the shit-filled
toilet yes
his car won't start after the the party
yeah he's running home you don't know
why he's running home and then it's just
you just have diarrhea and then his
phone falls in the toilet and he can't
wash his hands because the water's shut
off
there's no toilet paper i mean there's
just so
many weird weird things
like like the the roll call at the
family barbecue
that's another part that felt very wes
anderson to me yeah
we have the titles who the person is and
what their relation is
yeah like the opening shot there's a tv
and there's like a woman on it
explaining like
like violence in africa or something
yeah the tribes will kill you and
and the camera just slowly pans and
there's a lot of that
that's kind of style and he's just on
the couch
and and judy greer's on the couch
they're sleeping and he's just pissed
himself
and there's no explanation why and
she gets up and she smells it and you
know and he's like i gotta go to the
bathroom
and i guess that's a running theme in
the movie is him having bathroom
problems
yes he comes back later so and uh but
that there's the
the reveal of what the photo shoot ended
up being was
um just he's just looks miserable the
camera just slowly pans down to reveal
the cover
and then he does the audition for the
adult diapers 25 million americans
suffer from urinary incontinence
25 of that 25 million are men that's 5
million men with bladder problems
and there's a little touch where someone
coughs
right into the camera microphone when
he's delivering his line
oh yeah so so there's like i looked up
the director
uh some lady who's who used to do or
still does or
was a director in theater and she's done
a lot of movies and tv so she's probably
met tons of theater snobs
so there is that element of of the
industry because
there's a weird thing in the beginning
too that says this film was shot
entirely
on location in los angeles california
there's a there's a title at the
beginning and i'm like
okay you know is that abnormal or
something
and so what was the point of that but
then so there's this element of
of like success fame because martin
starr shows up
and he's like condescending to his
brother um
isaac about his his photo shoot
must pay well to have
to have your face be the face of
something like that
did it pay a lot and i saw a lot of
comments that were like it's a movie
that's trying to make you uncomfortable
but it doesn't go far enough
and i don't know i don't know what the
movie was trying to do
but i enjoyed the hell out of it i don't
know it gets pretty uncomfortable when
he spray
paints michael sarah's car with the
n-word yeah yes
yes oh that's when i was like wow
they're doing that but then i looked up
the director and was like okay it's a
black woman
like all right maybe this is a like a
black woman's view of
white people they're all fucking crazy
and weird
because yeah oh my god michael cera is
like oh
his his dialogue this is the best
performance he's ever given he's so
pretentious
and um and he has like this weird like
faux accent that he's doing like money
he says money like like he's trying to
sound like like cosmopolitan and worldly
and
you could tell he's he's a fraud i might
stay on a bit and do some traveling
after we wrap you know
maybe link up with some buddies of mine
over there i have friends everywhere
tunisia morocco
chad that's all in africa but it's all
so close you know it's really just right
there
i mean it feels a little farther than it
does on a globe but i'm still figuring
it all out
he's talking about all those worldly
events and then that
brett gelman is apparently in love with
michael cera he tries to kiss him
which leads to this like awkward the
boston
most awkward fight
but i have nothing
what it's about like what the goal was
i don't know it felt like it was uh just
trying to
criticize these types of like theater
and actor
and industry people um which is fine
but like i said without any sort of
character to ground it
it's hard to connect with anything
it doesn't have a general audience accessibility
no
it has like
which is often the kind of shit i like but with this movie it just did not connect with me because
who are you
i just thought
you're the guy who likes david lynch movies
i know but those have some some humanity
to them they have characters that even
if you don't
literally understand what's happening
you know you understand the the feeling
of it
and this movie it just felt too smug and
detached okay until neolong shows up
that's the last like half hour there's
some funny
situational humor him going to that
barbecue and
trying to connect with all these people
was was very funny to me
it was a gang a latino gang not a black
gang a lot of
people still think black when you say
gang
what people not you guys and not me but
people i just i think i found it
refreshing especially after watching
palm springs
which just felt so boilerplate watching
this
and and i think you know obviously i
like dry
humor and it doesn't get drier than this
sure and and normally i'm like a
structure person and i'm like what is
the protagonist's goal
what why what what you know but this was
just a
like just sit back and just say
what
yeah so heavily heavily high
recommendation
from me on lemon and a zero percent
recommendation i'm not recommending it
is lemon a lemon of a film
for you like i said i i started to get
interested in like the last half hour of
it so it's not a complete waste
and and yeah brett gellman is really
good uh
but just yeah focusing on that character
and all these characters
it rubbed me the wrong way it it
wouldn't work as
as a seven season long tv show well
sure but it would it works as a little 90 minute nugget of of what the fuck
uh well sticking with hulu we watched
another hulu film
one that actually came out this year
called palm springs
this is a movie that everybody went
crazy for for like a day and then
completely forgot about
jay tell us all about palm springs have
you ever seen groundhog day
or happy death day at least happy death
day had the uh
the nerve to reference groundhog day
yeah okay we're gonna own up to the fact
that this isn't a very original idea
this movie was fine it was cute i don't
know it's a romantic comedy
i was kind of thinking early on that
maybe it would end up being a little
heavier headier than it was because uh
andy sandberg's character is like this
horrible nihilist and that's the best
stuff in the movie is when he just
doesn't give a shit about anything because he's been trapped
in the same day for however long
i remember another horrible nihilist
trapped in the same day his name was
bill murray
i we're talking about this because it's
a bigger
released movie and it was popular
and it's the only closest thing we have
to like a
bigger s not even a studio movie just a
popular movie that people are actually
talking about
more people yeah that's not buried under
thousands of of hours of digging to try
and find like a horse girl like
no we had to i had to
dig to the earth's mantle to find a
horse girl
um but this is out there right in your
face palm springs you know ah you know
but it's it's you take out the the time
loop angle and it's the exact same
structure of every romantic comedy
they meet the awkward courtship uh
they start to fall for each other and
and the start of the third act they
gotta split up
how did the character or characters
grow uh well he learns
to stop not caring about anything
but that starts to care about her that
was because he was stuck in a time loop
yes and and her her it's her
angle is she starts off it's really more
a movie about her
because she's the one with like the
issues like
they they're like oh you know her
younger sister is the one getting
married so they're just like
hmm you know time's ticking on you
you're just you're a fuck up
and you know uh
and i does something happen at the end
that makes her
no longer want to be a fuck-up is it
just her love for
yeah starts to open her heart to
somebody else it's all very typical
stuff
and so then okay if you've got weak
character development and weak character
arcs
then at least stuff the movie full
chock full of uh repetition
time travel repeating the day jokes
sure which it sort of is
yeah i mean it's all very bland humor
cute is the word not funny
funny means you are
maybe offended a little a little
challenged
a little uncomfortable a little shocked
did you talk about lemon lemon was a
better comedy than palm springs
where something outrageous happens
outrageous i can think of
just a million adjectives to describe
the feelings that you sh you should get
when watching a comedy
everyone stand back
palm springs is as
bland as palm springs there's
there's a scene of excessive drug use
where andy sandberg parties with jk
simmons
and they do a bunch of like cocaine and
stuff jk simmons who's a more
interesting character than
our protagonist i liked his little
storyline better than
andy sandberg's i found that scene
offensive to those who have
drug addiction and drug addiction
is no laughing matter
cut that scene out i don't think humor
doesn't need to be
offensive or shocking to be funny i said
those were just two adjectives jay i
could come up with a hundred
okay relatability you know um well that
relatability is why uh lemon didn't work
for me but
i i humor i don't know it's it's you
know comedy is similar to horror where
it's like you have your build up and
then you have a release and it comes
from surprise of some sort
surprise that's that's what makes you
laugh generally is oh i wasn't expecting
that yes
unexpectedness surprise and this movie
is the exact opposite of being surprised
by anything
yeah i was thinking because this is a
lonely island production
yeah which is weird that was the opening
they have their
company logo and it looks like the sony
pictures classic logo
yeah it's a joke but it's like that's
not the type of joke that goes with the
humor of this movie
so that was weird because i think of
lonely island i think of all like you
know the
snl skits and i don't know do you ever
see their movie hot rod
that runs pretty funny my safe word will
be whiskey
sorry rod what was that whiskey so you
mean whiskey
what you're saying it weird saying what
weird
all of it it's very hit and miss but
it's it's
uh more absurdist humor yeah than this
was and i know annie sandberg in them
didn't like write this or whatever but
yeah it's their company behind it right
i remember that
that fake justin bieber documentary oh
yeah the uh
pop star yeah yeah i mean there's
there's some like
humor in that well that's that's what i
said like absurdist there's
their humor is usually a little more
heightened yeah um
and they're funny funny guys andy
sandberg's funny he's not he's not a
really
good actor his acting kind of reminds me
of like our acting like half of the bag
acting
i always like attribute certain things
to that sure oh that's half of the bag
acting
well that's this is the result of when
you have someone who just makes comedy
skits
and isn't like a real actor right and
then you start putting them in real
productions
i haven't watched i know he's on that
show brooklyn nine-nine
but that's a comedy show right yeah
there are certain like
scenes that were intended to be genuine
and heartfelt and
he can't pull that off yeah i mean no
she she carries the weight of those
scenes yeah no offense to him
it's just not his wheelhouse of talent
it's just doing dramatic scenes don't
work for andy sandberg
maybe some more outrageous stuff like if
you're going to have
something memorable that's the thing all
the scenes are just so bland
if you're going to have an hour in the
middle of the movie of them playing
around with time travel
they need to do something really crazy
or
outrageous or memorable i still remember
bill murray
and this is very simple but i still
remember it um
and ironically i've only seen groundhog
day one time oh my god
uh him memorizing jeopardy what are the
finger lakes
jim what are the finger lakes correct
this south american lake
what is titicaca so that sticks with me
it's funny
and that movie also has a montage of him
killing himself that's when he's at his
low point
and that's fun uh happy death day
2u has one of the best moments in any of
these movies
of the main character killing themselves
when she's in full uh
jogging uniform and just runs right into
the back of a wood chipper
just visually that's funny and it's dark
and it's kind of odd
yeah and this movie doesn't have
anything like that a little
not quite a flat line but um
little beeps in this that is cute it's
cute and watchable
and i think that's what a lot of people
want right now uh so
jay would you recommend palm springs
not really i mean unless you just want
to put something on
before you fall asleep yeah it's too
bland and forgettable and inoffensive to
like when i say i don't recommend it
it's not like oh it's so bad yeah
it's just it's like nothing
but what will go down in history as a
comedy classic
is a movie called relic
gran mom
so this is one we both watched neither
of us recommended it to each other
we just happened to both have watched it
um i was curious about it because yeah
it's a new horror movie it was on my
radar
i had never even heard of it until it
was released so i was like oh what is
this
oh horror film loki uh
character driven small scale atmosphere
core that's my thing
um and then what i got was not a horror
film what i got was one of the most fucking depressing uh family dramas i've seen in years
absolutely
it's very good but it's very fucking depressing
oh it's great
i i yeah i see that the poster for it and uh i saw the rotten tomatoes like i don't know high critic score
but very low audience score
all these types of horror movies are like that like
oh
that's that's it for me high critic low
audience
i'm in that means it's good because if
that means it's polarizing
yeah this was the most boring and
stupidest thing i've ever seen another
half star and then five stars this was
great and i'm just like yes
that means i'm not going to get palm
springs yeah i think i'm going to get
something
that uh i'm either going to love or hate
and uh i loved it and you know what
if uh if em ambiguous
gothic horror is not your thing stay far
away from it yes but i've i've realized
over the years
gothic horror is my thing
modern gothic modern gothic horror
um the haunting of hill house a hole in
the ground
the turning not the starring stranger
things
the babadook the babadook is a good one
to compare this to
because that this is an australian movie
and was that
australian or new zealand it's been a
while since i've watched it i don't know
but that's very similar to this in that
it's i guess technically a horror movie
but the horror is so
overtly metaphorical that's more of a
character drama uh yeah when i saw
when i started this up i didn't know
like
the production company and then when you
see like what is it like screen
australia or the film board
which means it's like it's a little
different over overseas
like sometimes the government funds the
arts yeah
and um not disney yes and so you know
when they got a grant from their
government
to make a film that it's gonna be good
it's cause somebody had an idea and they
were passionate about making a piece of
art
as a film that's a piece of art it
wasn't trick you trash
like like blumhouse makes for hulu yes
so when i see that it's like like
you know the the national film board of
australia
presents and i'm like yes yes
a committee of of australian bureaucrats
had to approve this screenplay
that means uh you know it wasn't it
wasn't pooka lips
yes we're going to approve pooka lips
taxpayer funded dollars for the arts
mom she called me a few weeks ago
i think she was scared uh
mother and her daughter uh can't find
grandma
and they go to grandma's house to find
her
now let's move on to spoilers
go to this time code for our official
wrap-up
so this is a movie where grandma's
missing
uh is this is this old lady in the walls
you know i think i think it was someone
on twitter because i mentioned this
movie and they
made a joke that you'll understand if
you've seen the movie they called it
mold lady in the walls i thought that
was clever
that is clever yeah uh but yeah it's
yeah
they find grandma it's not really like a
mystery it's just they're dealing with
her she has dementia
the movie's about emotionally dealing
with that
dealing with the a loved one kind of
slipping away
it's it's about female generational
uh issues too yeah and dealing with
mental illness
going passing down generations uh it's
not everyone's cup of tea because
you want you want a solid answer
and or you want uh fun spooky scares
yeah you don't get that there was a
there's history to this
this house to the land to the family
uh there's a really creepy nightmare
sequence with
dead bodies in a cabin and so
yeah that's the other thing too is
there's this cabin on their property
that they tore down but
they took the window from it and put it
in the main house grandpa went nuts
yeah and stayed in the house and um uh
the piece of stained glass is the
connective piece
that carries on to the house and you
know the grandma's like oh this house is
is everything it's my all my memories so
the house is like a metaphor for her
mind
because it becomes like willy wonka's
factory because
the girl the daughter ends up going in
the closet and there's all these
corridors and nothing makes sense
she finds this whole other part of the
house she didn't know existed it becomes
a maze and that's like the most
kind of nightmarish stuff in the movie
and it doesn't make sense
logically or realistically it just the
house just starts to break down
and um it's like you know how the house
is a metaphor for the old lady's mind
yeah well and also just that feeling of
if you've watched
like a loved one going through any sort
of like illness like that
that kind of emotional turmoil and the
toll it can take on you and
sometimes you get angry with them but
you love them and it's like all these
things
and so the end kind of builds up into
that
like emotionally but we're seeing it
represented with yeah this house and
then trying to tear through the walls
and get out and
graham's gone nuts briefly um
it's it's yeah it's it's barely a
literal horror movie at all
no it's all completely emotional and and
i think that's
um you know again with the reviews if
you look at user reviews it
sucked you know and because you get to
the end
and you want
your brain wants like them to call the
priest to come over and do the exercise
i'm just gonna say that do an exorcism
on granny and uh and and then you could
go okay
the the thing haunting granny in her
house
was was a demon and the demon is now
gone
but it's not that instead what you get
is oh uh everyone i
love and care about is going to die and
you're
yeah yeah it's it's especially that
ending it gets so somber
like it goes chaotic and then everything
kind of calms down and they realize they
can't leave grandma
and then yeah when she's like peeling
off her skin and it's like just coming
to accept it
well i i bet you if you go through this
movie and and pinpoint
moments it would probably follow the
the stages of grief that's what i was
thinking yeah like because it gets
chaotic and not the
there's acceptance and then there's
acceptance and then there's like
bargaining
at what like the point when the
daughter's like well maybe i could live
at grandma's house yeah
grandma could come live with me and we
can t and then there's like
you know um anger i think is one when
you get really mad
i don't know all the stages of of
grieving but um
they that when the they're running out
of the house you know there's this big
action scene where grandma is crazy and
they're hitting her and they bust
through the wall and they decide to
leave but the mother
the grandma's daughter uh
she stops and she's like i can't leave i
can't leave grandma
and and that's sort of like that's the
moment and she's she's lovingly peeling her skin off to reveal this creepy fucking disgusting dead version of her
this isn't gonna end like a james won films
uh uh uh what's her face
elizabeth uh warren
lorraine green worms i was always
wondering like
i think zach baggins is on the phone
every day trying to get
her stockpile oh sure he wants that
annabelle though
he would love to buy that annabelle doll
i think they're just waiting
man that would be a great scam but the
entire life
of the warrens i agree that was a great
scam i know
i mean um if if i was if i was
the warren's heirs son
daughter whoever i don't know i would i
would just find an old
raggedy ann doll this is the doll
six six point six six
million hey there you go well it's an
interesting number let me just write you
a check i don't know but zack beckham
sounds like a texan
that's an interesting number let me
write you a check
and then uh and then i would just sell
him
like just anything in a box
an old raggedy ann doll in a box and
give it to him and then
take the real one out and just be like
anytime you want another one come come
calling
not a lot of people do that but they had
five raggedy andals that were possessed
by annabelle
i just like go down to like the goodwill
and look for some weird thing and just
be like this was in the lorraine warren
collection
some kind of past ghost adventure she
went on
it's haunted zach and i'll give i'll
give you a break on the price on this
one 50
000. oh my god
jay can you believe this old bottle of
empty dan aykroyd vodka is haunted
oh my god
i trapped a dybbuk inside it
oh holy shit
and uh sometimes at night i'll place it
here
and the next morning when we come in
it's like over here
oh so i don't know i think this belongs
in zach baggins haunted museum
give us a call baggins
we got shit to sell you
we got so much haunted stuff
rich evans underwear
oh my god
that's the most haunted of all
it's haunted by the ghosts of thousands of farts
and real quick i want to mention this is
definitely a
female-centric driven movie about
about mental illness or alzheimer's or
some kind of debilitating
mental state that is passed down
hereditarily
um and and the interesting thing is uh
men are the only other characters
there's no other women characters
oh yeah that's true there's the police
officer the
the neighbor boy with down syndrome the
granddaughter goes over
to their house because they're the only
neighbors that are close and she talks
with the father
there's no mother so every other
superfluous character was a man
um and and it wasn't played for like
like ah you know whatever y'all you
ladies are crazy oh yeah it wasn't like
that
it was it didn't hate the male
characters they were treated fine but it
was just um
just something to note that they were
the
the extraneous characters so you're
really supposed to say
this is this is this is a problem with
the female bloodline in this family
do you know where you were mom i suppose
i went out this house seems
unfamiliar
uh well let's go through our films okay
should we rank them best
of worst sure why not okay so jay you've
got
four films and you're gonna rank them in
order
for our audience to decide if they want
to go out and
watch okay so what what's your number
one
uh oh number one with a bullet is relic
uh that's the only one i really loved i
think
i guess yeah i didn't really like the
other ones all that much at all
i guess horse girl would be number two
we're talking about quarantine viewing
where there's where there's your choice
between these movies
or trolls world tour so
choose choose your words carefully sure
well i would not
relic's a hard one to recommend because
you really have to be in the right frame
of mind to watch it because it
is so dour um especially during these
corrodivirus times some people might not
want to watch a
miserable depressing movie about
accepting dementia
and death but it's the best movie i
would say out of all these as far as
execution goes horse girl is pretty well
done
i didn't connect with the story all that
much but allison brie elevates it she's
really good
this is a toss up because i disliked so
much of lemon
but it's at least memorable so i guess
that would be three
and then the last one would be palm
springs because it's nothing my ranking
is is almost identical of number one of
course relic
uh number two lemon oh
oh uh it's all it's a near tie
okay between relic and lemon as my
number one picks
both with little asterisks on them that
say
one gothic horror that has no clear-cut ending that will depress the shit out of you
and lemon a gothic horror with no clear ending that will depress the shit out of you
uh so though those two films are are
with with the caveat of
be careful okay but uh yeah and then
horse girl
which i liked so lots of good stuff on
horse girl and
great performance by allison brie as
well as a great performance by her
merkin
hey well
another day fixing vcrs in the
quarantine am i right jay
oh lightning fast vcr repair this is
mike
