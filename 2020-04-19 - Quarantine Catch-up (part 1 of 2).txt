Half in the bag.
Mike why aren't you on your phone you should be calling and
texting people don't you realize it's
the last day before the government shuts
off the cellphone towers
I know I know
they found out that the 5g network really is spreading coronavirus
who the fuck cares
fuck my cell phone
everyone I know is dead anyway
fuck
well even still today is a day of
mourning it's been exactly one month
since China sent 500 naval ships filled
with hundreds of thousands of people
infected with the corona virus to the
beaches of California
they flooded the state just fucking coughing on everyone
now almost everyone in California is dead
and the virus is slowly making its way east
yeah
and yet still Disney is altering their movies to appeal to the Chinese market
but think of all the celebrities we've lost
who will be the guiding light to our wayward souls during these troubling times
who will entertain us with their hilarious and uplifting videos filmed from inside their gigantic mansions
or doing a live stream where they talk about themselves
you know to raise money for bird sanctuary charities
the complete lack of worry on their smiling faces as they know deep in their hearts that they have enough money to never have to work again and to never leave their house if they don't need to
and it doesn't make me despise them at all
yeah
the truly tragic part is that without maids and groundskeepers they'll have to clean their own homes
I get kind of choked up when I think about Bette Midler having to push a vacuum around her forty thousand square foot house
hey what are you what are you watching
oh you know I'm watching that new
Invisible Man film in 4k no less Mike I
don't think that j-just let me have this
part get those little wavy lines waitin
and my favorite scene it's a scene when
the Invisible Man is invisible just
walking around doing stuff he's up to no
good that Invisible Man
nope just lost signal no more cell phone
service this is just a paperweight now
phone's ringing hello mom and dad huh
boy it sure is great to hear from you
especially after all those years ago
when you told me that you no longer had
a son what's that you're proud of me I'm
not an embarrassing failure ah it's so
good to have closure on this matter
after all these years well you two stay
safe okay bye
I'm getting a signal maybe you shouldn't
use sprint Mike I'm not getting any
service I really don't never mind hey
since you're watching The Invisible Man
why don't we talk about that and some of
the other things we've been watching
while we're stuck in mr. plinkus house
what a great conclusion to this wacky
setup
saddest size offense just chicken wires
medical-grade nothing can pass through
it
not even droplets from coronavirus I'm
gonna drink another zombie don't
remember before the quarantine when we
didn't start drinking till after 3 p.m.
well it's what 7 a.m. now yeah so was
that really late from the night before
or really earth lock what are you doing
over there I can't see you through this
fence you know Robert Frost said fences
make good neighbors and fences keep out
coronavirus well the 5g network may be
down but streaming television isn't all
those servers running 24/7 we're
polluting the air with so much carbon
it's like we're flying 20000 Jets every
person every second look we're all stuck
inside what are we supposed to do read a
book go for a walk
foster animals donate to a charity I
want to watch tiger King dammit well you
brought it up you want to talk about
tiger king everyone's talking about
tiger king tiger king
it's not every day that a zippy burger
with the prison for murder for hire
there are more captive tires in the US
then there are in the wild throughout
the world you go ahead you I I watched
three episodes and I had to stop oh you
got that far into it okay yeah I know
you said you watched a little bit of it
I assumed you watched the first episode
and we're like fuck this I'm not I'm not
dealing with these people I was slightly
interested and and then yeah it made me
want to take a shower it's really it's
really when they got into the one guy
was a polygamist yes yes yeah the
reaction to it has been weird because
people are like making memes and like
Joe exotic as his kooky guy it's like no
he's a scumbag all these people are
horrible it's it's a really dark gross
show but people are reacting to it like
it's this kooky thing which is weird
yeah I mean Joe Joe exotic I think it
was a fascinating story but Joe exotic
is like he's a scumbag
I mean he's abusing these animals he's
grooming young men young straight men
and like filling him with drugs
he got him you got Carroll Baskin who's
complaining about Joe exotic keeping
these animals in tiny cages while she
herself does the exact same thing that
she's also questionable and she's very
questionable she may've fed her first
husband to to a tiger and then you get
to the yeah the polygamous guy who's grooming young girls
and as this fucking cults
it's the perfect companion piece to roar and grizzly man
yeah
in that it really pinpoints that these fucking people that have this weird romanticized idea of these wild animals as being this magical thing and using them for their own sort of like narcissistic reasons
they're all fucking crazy
well they all seem to be like control freaks, too
yeah yeah
and and if if you can control tigers then you can control people
and they're so there I'm sure
some kind of psychotherapists can
really break these people down but there
is something there cuz like I never
wanted to own a tiger yeah I've never
wanted to own an exotic animal because
you think about the the Grizzly Man guy
where ya like keeps going back to that
Nature Preserve and thinks he has some
sort of magical bond with the animals
and say no they're wild animals they're
gonna eat you and then they do yeah it's
a way to like the one guy the polygamist
guy it seems more of a way to lure and
control people and yeah and on top of
that he's like a cultish pervert so the
the lure of tigers and that lifestyle of
of his encampments was attractive to
that one I saw the part where they
interviewed one lady who escaped the
cult yeah and she's like she's like yeah
I was like 17 or 18 and I was like I'm
gonna go do this I'm gonna work with
these Tigers and yeah take off your
clothes oh my god and then I read some
kind of spoilers somewhere that said the
this was not included in the documentary
but after I guess Joe xotic goes to
prison I didn't get that far he does
yeah but they show him the show they
call he's calling from prison yeah I'm
sorry assume he went to prison I don't
know what for exactly possibly trying to
murder Carol Baskin yes for hiring
someone to murder Carroll Baskin but
they're like the show went up in his
attic and they found a bunch of weird
S&M stuff and then they found stuffed
Tigers and not stuffed animal Tigers but
like taxidermy tgers with like like a
fuckhole in the mouth and and in the butt
oh
so he was, him and his husband's presumably were doing some kinky stuff
or he was in his private time sexualizing dead tigers
And I was like, "I'm out."
i'm gonna go watch cheers
cheers is an HD now by the way on netflix
they remastered at all
it looks gorgeous
fuck yeah
the last time i binge watch
that show it was still like looked like VHS masters
Cheers
making your way in the world today takes everything you got
but yeah I really enjoyed Tiger King I
thought it was a fascinating drinking
away all your worries hey let's do shot
hey wouldn't you like to get your face
sometimes you eyes babbling so song ends
they're always glad your social
distancing juice is now closed
you
yeah so let's tie your king like I think
it's very well done it's just
interesting to see what people have
gotten out of it and how people find it
funny when it's just incredibly
upsetting but it's it's I think it's
worth watching but if you think it's too
disgusting or having to watch these
horrible people I can understand it's up
to the individual viewer I share because
you have trash television that's
fascinating and kind of fun to watch 90
day fianc√© before the 90 days
which is just fucking wonderful for my 600 pound life or
there's all sorts of great programs on
TLC my 600 pound tumor my 600 pound
tumor dr. popper the lady that God shut
out of people's bodies see that I could
never ever watch yeah it's fucking gross
but yeah like I don't know there's those
shows that like the reality shows that
are like of food sketchy people your
honey Boo Boo's and duck dynasty's and all that shit
I don't like that stuff
yeah
but the characters in it while odd and eccentric and oftentimes kind of gross there's always a little bit of heart or likability and this Tiger King show Oh everybody's awful
it just seems like it's awful
and you didn't even get to the guy that
supposedly Scarface was based on oh I
did see that okay the guys talking he's
like the most likable guy in the movie
and he's a murderer tell the feds or the
judge your honor I did not shoot him and
I didn't I use them they not used a
circular saw his neck it was somebody
else what difference to make it's still
there yeah I don't know I don't know
about Tiger King I'm just picturing the
filmmakers though they they start
filming this this documentary series and
realizing how absurd every character is
and being like we just struck gold
let's talk about movies though that's
why we're here J okay that's our show
half in the bag it used to be before the
dark times before the dark times before
the corona you see all right beasts hey
there you go grow up before coronavirus
yeah an ad after death after death
a V after vaccine oh there you go
so J let's talk about a movie that we
both saw one of the very last films to
come out in movie yeah theater theater
theaters what were those things called
movie they called a movie palaces way
back in the day I think movie houses
yeah in the 21st century they were
called theaters now they're called
abandoned strip malls yeah another
abandoned their megachurches now but now
they're all closed and they're never
going to reopen no because the world has
woken up to the fact that you could
watch movies in your home
and the studio system has woken up to
that fact the world is forever changed
yeah
after coronavirus but we both watched
The Invisible Man
yes that played in the theaters for half
the corona virus epidemic
hey long enough to make some some decent
money and then they said early release
on VOD yeah well that's something we
should talk about before talking about
the movie is the whole release strategy
because it's it's it's very people are
very divided it's exclusive early access
or whatever they were calling it but
it's 20 bucks to rent for 24 hours 48
hours and people are like oh that's too expensive
other people are like that's fucking great
I got a household five six people
yeah
it's only one price
so I think it yeah I think it just depends on your your outlook
I'm more than happy to spend $20 to not go to a movie theater
yeah
the opportunity watch something to Nome
but it also depends on your setup I guess
yeah and the $20 anything is the perfect median price
because like you said there could be somebody who lives by themselves so there could be somebody with a household of ten people
you know 150 dollars is a little too much
ten is a little too low
because someone's gonna take advantage of it and have ten people over at their house
so twenty dollars I think twenty
dollars is perfect it was this and the
hunt the blum hunt the other blum house
may mean the only way to really
calculate this is to have like a big
tent pole movie like the Wonder Woman
movie that was supposed to come out
Black Widow I don't know yeah yeah
something like that that's a big like
Marvel or Disney kind of thing and just
say okay here it is
boom because I have projections of based
on past movies you know like when when
Wonder Woman 1984 comes out it's
expected to make this much yeah and they
based it on past models and all this
analytics and data and stuff and how
everything's out the window now yeah so
it would be like a situation where they
would have to like dip their toe in the
water so to speak
put Wonder Woman out on streaming on
every possible platform around the whole
world all at once and see how much money
they make
and if they make you know half of what
they would in the theaters then they
would definitely pull back and say we're
gonna wait till the movie theaters
reopen if they made more money than they
would side with theaters and say we want
the audience to have a theater-going
experience see me they'd lie they
wouldn't say we want whatever will make
us the most money yeah they were being
sarcastic there
yeah
they would say fuck you movie theaters cuz--
well that the first movie that did was supposed to go in theaters and went directly to VOD is the trolls movie
yeah
how'd that do
I don't know
that's the thing is they don't have to yeah give these numbers out so nobody knows so it's also a way to avoid people knowing that a movie is a flop in future releases
it's kind of like trying to find out how many people actually watch Star Trek Picard on CBS All Access
it's a big hit Mike
it was announced for a second season for the first season even aired
mmhmm
that definitely wasn't announced just to get people thinking that the show was gonna be worth watching
but yeah yeah they don't have to announce their money they could just
you'll know if it made them money if
more movies appear on VOD yeah a real
way to test and that's why this has been
so interesting because we've been
talking about the death of theatres
forever I will gladly stay at home and
watch movies as opposed their stuff I'd
watch at home that I wouldn't bother to
see in theaters but I'll pay 20 bucks to
you know just watch it at home then
there are some movies that are nice to
see in a big big movie theater less and
less it's it's more so the theater
growing experience than the movies
themselves I think I think when we did
Avengers end game I may be wrong but I
think we called that like the last
blockbuster little did we know that it
would be forced to be the last
blockbuster I mean you can't really call
rise of Skywalker a true blockbuster oh
no that was that was a funeral it did
well it said well liked it made money of
course as it would but I wasn't a
phenomenon nobody liked it yeah the
future is unwritten Jay only time will
tell the only certainty we have is that
kwibi will flop kwibi
what happened to him he dreams dead
yeah Invisible Man was was really
enjoyable it was a nice take on the
Invisible Man character can we be
worried about spoilers Oh
spoilers whatever it's been out its what
not a long time I saw some people
complaining about the way he becomes the
Invisible Man in this how it's like a
like a like a suit like a scientific
suit usually they're saying that's like
silly it's like doesn't matter the
original storied rings like a magic
potion well okay that's that's silly
how the invisible man becomes the
Invisible Man because this movie is not
about an Invisible Man
well real quick the whole movies about
being in an abusive relationship and
gaslighting yes definitely and that's
what the whole movie is about it's not
about the Invisible Man it's it's a very
metaphorical movie about relationships
specifically abusive relationships
like he said gas lighting and the
opening of the film is Elisabeth Moss is
trying to escape the relationship yeah
it just goes right into it it starts off
yeah and you know like she's she's
sleeping in her bed and his hand is over
her you know a symbol of her and being
controlling she knocks him out with some
valium and she's planned her escape from
his massive compound like house we're in
the basement he does some kind of
scientific experiments and all we see is
just some stations and some things we
get every all the information we need in
this opening scene without like any like
I think I'm quoting the Phantom Menace
review but without a line of dialogue
right right that's a show don't tell it
yes they say picturing a more generic
movie or you have like the first ten
minutes of showing him being an asshole to her
yeah
it's like her performance, too, she's so great cuz it conveys all that without trying to show any of it
she's obviously terrified and she's obviously planned this out meticulously how to escape this guy
mmhmm
and so you that like
he must be pretty fucking terrible yeah
that first ten minutes
is frightening it's very like
nerve-racking oh yeah you know the fear
of her getting caught without having
even seen this guy's face right um it's
really well done and then
yeah she's got her heard her go bag her
escape bag with all her stuff in it and
she escapes and then yeah the rest of
the movie is
besides for this guy being an abusive
controlling monster he's a monster
he's a universal classic Universal month
all for the modern age and he he just he
really wants to control her and and get
back at her for leaving him yeah well in
convinced everybody else that she's
crazy yeah if I had one complaint about
the movie it's that there's probably a
few too many scenes that say exactly
that I mean that's that's the movie yeah
you know it's not her going like back
into the lab and trying to figure out
the invisible suit and getting her own
and then fighting him
yeah but with where there's two
invisible suits there the technology the
suit is brushed off is like that's
cameras and mirrors like it really
doesn't matter that's a real thing
that's a real thing though sure but they
don't they don't feel the need to over
explain it and make sure that it's
realistic because it really doesn't
matter it doesn't matter the point is is
she's trying to escape an abusive
relationship but they do have that sort
of they were working on that technology
or you have a little video thing and
then on your back there's a camera and
the camera shoots what is behind you try
and explain it Adrian is dead he's got
he has figured out a way to be invisible
they don't explain how it makes him
super strong he kinda has like super
strength when he's when they're wearing
that outfit he's like picking people up
off the ground and holding above it's
probably extra silent somehow he's
completely silent it's easy to throw
Elizabeth moss around tiny lady okay
fair enough
these are my only complaints about the
movie because I really liked it overall
I like the the execution of a lot of the
scenes and just like hangs on these wide
shots so she's like coming and going
from the room it's just this flat wide
shot and it gets you like scanning
around the entire frame like where where
is he what's going to happen that shot
where he turns up the fire yeah yeah
it's really good at building the tension
you build that so that's what it did
build the tension and then that starts
with him trying to start the fire and
then he she slaps the daughter remember
yeah and then it's slowly like people
not believing her and thinking she's
crazy and you know like I'm sure that's
happened to a lot of women out there
where their husbands or boyfriends are
just awful and they try to make them
look crazy in front of other people you
know to the enth degree in this movie I
love at the end it's not like I'm
picturing again a dumber like it's
simpler movie or it's like they have the
confrontation on the rooftop in the rain
it's like no there's no big exciting
action scene at the end it's them at a
dining room table it's so understated oh
really well done yeah yeah there's so so
you yeah you got just got this nice
little build up of all the stuff and
then there's there's your third act
twist you throw that in there it's
enjoyable to watch watch her performance
in it because really that's that's all
there is I get the wrong wrong person in
that role in the whole movie yeah part
yeah really really good yeah because
she's got that that it's got that
vulnerable quality to her mm-hmm she's
very small in stature that that scene
when she musters up the courage to go
out and get the mail oh yeah and and she
she leaves the house and she's just
she's walking you know like all timid
and
she's got her back it was like hunched
it's a great physical performance from her
and then she looks like a fucking wreck in the insane asylum
yeah yeah no vanity as far as an actor
goes this is like the polar opposite of
the Tom Cruise mummy movie it's like
look at how buff and badass I am
Saturday Alex Kurtzman production it was
and this was not believe it or not this
was not an Alex Kurtzman okay I just
wanted to make make that clear Alex
Kurtzman had nothing to do with this no
he didn't okay did Alex Kurtzman was he
involved with the card yes
okay okay so that's why that well
received
let's Invisible Man it's worth watching
I I think it's worth 20 bucks absolutely
you don't own it you're just renting it
but I really liked it it was very classy
yes yeah that's a good word for it and I
felt like it was about something bigger
it wouldn't feel like a schlocky Blom
house movie know it but it felt like it
was about something bigger or something
more important without being hit you
over the head ish right and I'm I'm
really surprised that the the quote
armies of man babies and you know like
when a movie like this comes out which
is clearly like miss and rest'
yeah that is that right where it's just
like I'm surprised those little trolls
in come out everywhere
you make a good movie that isn't hitting
you over the head with nonsense and is
actually a quality film that's about
something and you know it makes a
difference you know it's a great way to
remake the Invisible Man
in a modern era without the the schlocky
costume although I there were a couple
of nods there that were oh yeah there's
the guy and it's wrapped in bad
and only a seven million dollar budget
grossed over a hundred million that's
the best part that budget is under 10
million dollars
I hope Elisabeth Moss got some good
contracts on that got some points on
that on that back end all I know is she
won't be nominated for an Academy Award
no she should be but she won't she'll
get I call it Toni Collette 'add you're
Toni Collette didn't get nominated for
hereditary even though it's one of the
best performances ever yeah last year it
was the pizza a younga she got passed
over for us now this year it's gonna be
Elizabeth moss because it's a horror
genre yeah I understand they don't like
those soggy horror movies yeah even when
they're not shocked hey you know what
this is this nest next Oscars there's
gonna be very few competition Elizabeth
moss versus a troll great best actor
Googler BA from from trolls to and
Elizabeth moss that's all we got yeah
that's all that came out everything spun
out back so it'll be like the the CGI
troll will be sitting in the seat
everyone will be fine no it'll just be
on zoom everyone will be ho it'll be a
little bee in their den yeah it'll it'll
be like one of those like like pixelated
images yeah like The Truman Show poster
you know let's maybe that's how so many
people know it'll double be like best
actress nominees I was wittle zoom in
and then that'd just be Elizabeth moss
and the troll yeah cartoons troll
