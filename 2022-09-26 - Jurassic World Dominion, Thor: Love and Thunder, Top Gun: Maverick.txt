PLINKETT:
Half in the bag!

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

JAY:
Well, now we're all caught up with all the big summer blockbuster movies that we didn't see in theaters.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.

JAY:
And I definitely don't feel like it was a waste of 10 hours of our lives.

MIKE:
Was that sarcasm?

JAY:
I can't wait to watch the extended cut of Jurassic World: Dominion.
If there's one thing I want it's more of that.

MIKE:
Anyhoo.

JAY:
We watched, we watched "real movies".
We watched the big ones.

MIKE:
We watched three big summer blockbusters, when the blockbuster is almost as extinct as dinosaurs themselves.
Uh, and it's interesting because the three blockbuster films we chose to discuss, uh, go from, uh...
Well, it's the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Um, go from great to okay to terrible.
Almost, uh, perfectly line up.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And our opinions might differ a little, Jay.
But uh that's where, where I'm starting this discussion out as.

JAY:
Okay.
Are we starting with the good or the ugly?

MIKE:
I guess we'll start with the ugly.
I don't know if anyone even cares to hear about our opinions on Jurassic World: Dominion.
So we'll get that one out of the way.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Right out of the gate real fast.
"The Asylum presents Fantasy Dinosaur Force from Colin 'Never Smile' Trevorrow, the director of The Book of Henry."
"He's back with another Jurassic World film."
"This time, Owen Thunderguns and his subjugated lady friend must find their daughter, Eleven, who they hide in a cabin in the woods because she's a human clone who was reproduced asexually in a lab by her mother who died of clone cancer."
"However Owen and subjugated lady friend can't just sit still in that cabin and get real jobs."
"They've got to go on dino-saving adventures to show that they care about dinos."
"Oh."
"And dinosaurs are all over the planet."
"But people still go out living their lives, going to drive-in movie theaters and walking around in the park where dinos can eat them."
"Did I mention that?"
"The fact that dinos are all over the planet brings out the best and the worst in people."
"However, old friends Dr. Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant, and Dr. Jeff Goldblum are on a separate mission to find out why Hank Scorpio and the Globex Corporation have created giant locusts that terrorize children."
Would you like to hear the IMDb description real quick?

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
"Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, Biosyn operatives attempt to track down Maisie Lockwood, while Dr. Ellie Sattler investigates a genetically engineered swarm of giant insects."
Uh, not a once-a mention of a dinosaur in the IMDb description.

JAY:
Well, that's pretty appropriate.
Because this isn't a movie about dinosaurs.
It's a movie about locusts.
Finally, at the end of the second movie in a franchise called Jurassic World, they establish that the dinosaurs are loose now.
That stupid clone girl let 'em loose because they're real, like her.

MAISIE LOCKWOOD:
I had to.
They're alive.
Like me.

MIKE:
Oh, that's right.
That's how that one ended.

JAY:
That was the line.
It was the dumbest ending to one of the dumbest movies that's ever been made.
Uh, and so I'm like:
"Finally, now the next movie, we're finally gonna get fucking dinosaurs rampaging cities and causing havoc all over the world."
And we get, like, uh, like, uh, like, an Instagram, uh, news update at the very beginning.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
There's, like, there's some dinosaurs here.
Anyway, locusts.

MIKE:
There was one scene where a T-Rex rampaged through, uh, a drive-in movie theater.

JAY:
Which isn't in the theatrical cut.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
We watched, uh...

MIKE:
No shit!

JAY:
Yeah.
You watched the extended cut on Peacock.
You watched the theatrical cut, which has even less dinosaurs.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
There have never been more dinosaurs than there are in Dominion in a movie.

MIKE:
No kidding.

JAY:
That whole opening of the extended cut where we see 65 million years ago...
There's dinosaurs fighting.
We see the mosquito land.
And, and then that goes into the, uh, the drive-in movie theater scene.
None of that's in the theatrical cut.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
You see dinosaurs in snow.
You see dinosaurs in cities.

MIKE:
How does it open?

JAY:
It, it opens with the, uh, Instagram story or whatever it is.
NowThis.
It opens with that.
Actually, no.
I think there's, very briefly, there's the bit where the...
They're trying to lure the dinosaur out of the water, and it bites onto the cage.
I think it shows that, and then it goes to the new story.
But, yeah.
That whole opening, which is one of the very few moments of dinosaurs actually wreaking havoc somewhere in public.
It's just gone.

MIKE:
Wow, that's surprising.

JAY:
Look, you don't have time to put dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
There have never been more dinosaurs than there are in Dominion in a movie.
Like, maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie.

MIKE:
It was like two movies in one.
Like, the, the Owen Thunderguns and, uh, Bryce Dallas Howard stuff.
And then, uh, and their pilot friend, Kayla.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Um...

JAY:
Han Solo?

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Kayla Watts is Han Solo.
Yeah.

MIKE:
We'll talk about that in one second.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, and, and Maisie Lockwood.
The clone.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, the, the...
There's some biblical elements in this film.
I want to get really intellectual here.

JAY:
Well, Colin Trevorrow, he's a smart man.

MIKE:
He's a smart...

JAY:
He writes very smart scripts.

MIKE:
The, the virgin birth.
Uh, uh, she, she is, she is like, like, a messiah because she contains the...
She contains genes that could possibly save the world because she's, she's the new Jesus.
And, um...

JAY:
I think that's the frustrating thing about Colin Trevorrow, is he does have ideas.
Like, that first Jurassic World movie.
There's a whole meta thing about the original Jurassic Park was great.
And it's like:
"Okay."
"You're trying for something."
"But the rest of everything that's happening is dumb as shit."

MIKE:
There, there are some, like, possibly kernels of good ideas in this.
Like, you know, who, who shows their true colors as being good, good human beings and bad human beings.
Which is like real life, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There would be people trying to make money off it.
And Owen Thunderguns runs into some in the beginning.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Like, he's saving a diplotosaurus, or whatever fucking thing, and, and he's like:
"How much does ground up dinosaur bones go for on the black market?"
"$500,000?"
"$1,000,000?"
"$500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000?"
And so as he lets them go...

JAY:
I'm smiling because that's also not in the theatrical cut.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
That whole sequence.
You see him round up the dinosaur, and then it cuts to him back on the, uh, back at the cabin.

MIKE:
No shit?

JAY:
Another part that's actually kind of interesting.

MIKE:
Yeah!

JAY:
An idea of, like, yeah, these dinosaur poachers...

MIKE:
Right.
Well...

JAY:
It's all gone!
I mean, they come up later in the movie.

MIKE:
I wonder why they cut it out.
Because he...
There's, like, Owen has a couple of, like, park ranger guys with him.
Like, two, I think.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then the bad guy, like, bad cowboy guys, have like six or seven guys on horses.
And they all have shotguns.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And the two, the two, like, wildlife guys are, have, like, just simple pistols.
And so, like, Owen has to, like, he's like:
"I don't want to get in a shootout with these guys."
"We're gonna get fucking slaughtered."
So he lets the dinosaur go.
He lets them have the dinosaur.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it's kind of sad.
They take the dinosaur and they, they cart it off.
And it just kind of goes along with them.
And you know it's going to get killed and stripped of all of its meats.

JAY:
Or used in a cockfight, as we see later in the movie.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Dinosaur fights.

MIKE:
Underground cockfighting.
Um...

JAY:
Which is a part of the maybe 15-20 minute stretch of the movie that I kind of enjoyed.

MIKE:
Yeah.
When they go to Malta?

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it turns into a Mission Impossible movie.

MIKE:
It turns into a...

JAY:
With dinosaurs.

MIKE:
Then you got the Biosyn guy.
The, uh, Steve Jobs, uh, Bill Gates kind of...
He's like the most apathetic, lame, boring villain ever.

JAY:
Well, did you even catch who that was?

NEDRY:
Dodgson!
Dodgson!
We've got Dodgson here!

JAY:
It's a returning character.

MIKE:
What?

JAY:
Remember Dodgson from the beginning of the first Jurassic Park?
He meets Wayne Knight and gives Wayne Knight the Barbasol.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's that character.
They inexplicably decided to bring him back.
He has such a tiny part in that first movie.
He has nothing to do with anything, other than giving him the Barbasol.

MIKE:
But not that actor.

JAY:
Not that actor.
Which is like, if you can't get the actor, then why do it at all?

MIKE:
Well, you know what happened with the actor?

JAY:
Oh!
That's right.
He was like a, he's...

MIKE:
[EXPLICIT]

JAY:
He's, uh, he's one of those those, uh, [EXPLICIT] that I've heard so much about in Hollywood.
There's no reason for that character to be that character from the first movie.

MIKE:
Oh, gosh...

JAY:
Now he's basically Tim Cook from Apple.
Their whole facility...
It's, it's like this round building that looks just like the Apple, uh, headquarters.
If you ever watch any of their, like...

MIKE:
Sure.
They're making some kind of commentary on, like, big tech geneticists that either want to profit from pharmaceutical research, or...

VOICEOVER:
CEO Lewis Dodgson has created a sanctuary in Italy Dolomite Mountains, where he hopes to study the dinosaur's ancient immune systems for unique pharmaceutical properties.

MIKE:
Their sophisticated scientific laboratory, uh, which I'm sure they use a lot of computers, uh, did have beakers filled with colored fluid for the little dinosaur  -- the baby of Blue, the raptor -- to jump around and smash.

JAY:
Well, it's a science lab.

MIKE:
You gotta have a beaker...

JAY:
You gotta have beakers.

MIKE:
With blue, green, red fluids in beakers on tables just open.
No tops on them.
Just sitting there.
Waiting to get smashed in an exciting sequence.

HENRY WU:
The locust's prehistoric DNA has made them stronger than they should be.
They're multiplying like crazy, and they're not dying.
What part of this don't you understand?

DODGSON:
Well, I do understand.

HENRY WU:
This is going to be a global famine.

DODGSON:
Hey, hey.
We can't anticipate everything.

HENRY WU:
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

DODGSON:
What?

HENRY WU:
All of them.

MIKE:
His plan with the locusts was what again?
Him and Henry Wu had a good intentions.
But it, they, they genetically engineered locusts to do something, but then it went bad.

JAY:
It got out of control.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then the locusts...

JAY:
And then eventually he sees the error of his ways and burns the rest of the locusts that are still in the facility.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
I just watched this movie.

MIKE:
While also covering his tracks, because he's trying to destroy the hard drive.

JAY:
Yeah.

KAYLA WATTS:
This place?
Not your vibe.

MIKE:
There, there's our friend, Kayla Watts, who's...
And I don't know if...
Again, Colin Trevorrow may be a secret genius because he was fired from Star Wars Part IX.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because he made Book of Henry.
And then everyone panicked because Book of Henry flopped.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
So they fired him from Star Wars IX.
So then we have this Kayla Watts character, who is essentially Han Solo.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Uh, she's a smuggler.
She has her own little aircraft.
And when you're in the cockpit, it looks identical to the Millennium Falcon.

JAY:
The framing of the shots.

MIKE:
The framing of the shots.
The way that you could kind of see the secondary backseats, which probably aren't on a big plane like that.
I don't know.

LUKE:
What's that flashing?

HAN SOLO:
We're losing our deflector shields.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm going to make a jump to light speed.

CLAIRE DEARING:
Why is it blinking?

KAYLA WATTS:
Uh, that's the, uh, Aerial Deterrent System.

MIKE:
And then she's doing the, uh...
When they're trying to land at the Apple headquarters -- the Biosyn headquarters -- she's trying to get landing permission.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And they're like, they're like:
"Permission denied."
You know, it's exactly like when Han Solo's, like, trying to land at, um, the Cloud City.
Or, or fucking around with the, the microphone on the Death Star.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She had that same kind of flair.
So is that, like, his, like:
"Hey, you may have fired me from Star Wars, but I'm putting Han Solo in this movie."

JEFF GOLDBLUM:
I'll tell you.
Colin.
That Colin Trevorrow.
He's good.
He's a good director.

MIKE:
Owen Thunderguns and subjugated lady friend, uh, who no longer has a will of her own...

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
But to follow Owen Thunderguns around to the ends of the Earth.
Because they're in love.

JAY:
And people called the first Jurassic World movie sexist.

MIKE:
Right.
She hasn't, she...
Bryce Dallas Howard no longer has a character.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's not the, the, uh, sophisticated women that she was in the first one, where she ran the theme park.
Now she, uh, runs around and tries to save dinosaurs in cages with, like, scared college students who don't wanna do it anymore.

JAY:
They get rid of those characters real quick.

MIKE:
They were the ones from the other one.

JAY:
They were annoying in the last movie.
They're like:
"Ehh, we'll put them in one scene to explain why they're not in the rest of the movie."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Why even bother?
Just don't have 'em in it.

MIKE:
Kayla the pilot spots the little girl in Malta.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Being stolen by Frau Farbissina to, to be sent to Tim Cook at the Apple headquarters because Henry Wu wants Kayla Lockwood to study her genes to fix how they fucked up the process with the locusts and/or save the human race by figuring out a solution to the world's food supply.
This is...
I got a lot from this by barely patying attention.
I was on my phone the whole time.
Uh, half-asleep.
You know, I was playing checkers on my phone.
So then they're flying in her, her Millennium Falcon.
And, and of course, pterodactyls appears.
No one likes pterodactyls, but they always appear in these movies.

JAY:
Well, they can fly, so they're different than other dinosaurs.

MIKE:
They attack the plane.
They fuck the plane up.
And, um, Owen Thunderguns says:
"This plane's gonna crash, Bryce Dallas Howard."
"Jum-..."
"You better eject."

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Because there's only one ejection seat that works, or something.

JAY:
Something like that.

MIKE:
And, uh, uh, I'm man, I'm man...
I'm Owen Thunderguns.
And you're lady.
You're my subjugated lady.
Uh, and you better get out of the plane.
And so they shoot her out.
And so Owen and Kayla crashland in a, in a ice field...
What is it called?
A frozen lake?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And they get out.
And, of course, it's now time for dino set piece.
Dino action set piece.

JAY:
Plug it in.
Boop!

MIKE:
And, and Kayla...
I think at some point it's revealed that she was former military.

OWEN GRADY:
Where'd you learn to fly?

KAYLA WATTS:
Uh, Air Force.
Legacy on my momma's side.

OWEN GRADY:
Yeah.
I'm Navy.

MIKE:
And Owen Thunderguns is also former military ops.
He has all sorts of skills because he was the, the, the, the velociraptor wrangler.

JAY:
Yeah, he trained the dinosaurs in the first movie.

MIKE:
So he, he has skills.
Let's just say he has adventure skills.
He has survival skills.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
This, this is not in doubt, right?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And Kayla also does.
And they start walking on the ice.
The ice begins to crack under their feet.
What do they do?
They walk slower, and more carefully.
Right?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And there was no dinosaurs around at this time, right?

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
So there was no threat quite yet.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, what do you do in that situation, Jay?
Common sense.

JAY:
Uh, I would run before it all cracks up.

MIKE:
No, no, no.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
That's a bad idea.

JAY:
Well, what's a good idea then?

MIKE:
What you do in that situation is, you lay down on your belly, and you, you army crawl.
Because...

JAY:
So there's less weight going straight down?

MIKE:
Weight, all your weight is distributed on the soles of your feet.
All your weight is centered on one spot.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Movie-wise, it's more exciting for them to slowly walk on the ice, going...

JAY:
You're building the tension, yeah.

MIKE:
Tension.
Uh, but logically, those two characters would know to lay on their bellies and go like this.
Although it would look really silly.
And, and so that kind of stuff -- even though this is a dumb movie -- kind of takes me out a little bit sometimes.

JAY:
Okay.
I was checked out by that point.

MIKE:
I expect more from Jurassic World: Dominion.

JAY:
I will say, the shot where Bryce Dallas Howard gets ejected from the plane...
That's a creative shot.
Where it's just kind of locked on her.
That's something.

MIKE:
She lands in her thing in the woods.
Falls out.
And there's a dinosaur walking around.
And then she goes in the water.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And then the dinosaur looks around for her.
And then walks away.
And then she comes out of the water.
Uh, uh, I felt absolutely nothing.
I felt...
There was no tension.
There was no excitement.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There was literally nothing, other than events happened in a sequence.

JAY:
Scenes happening on-screen.

MIKE:
They happened in a sequence.
Well, the, the...
I noticed three bits of ADR.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
There, there's a funny part -- and I'll play it in this edit -- Jeff Goldblum is lecutring students at the Apple university.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And that's his job there, I guess.
Just to teach, maybe?
As an instructor?

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
A chaos instructor.

JAY:
He has a history with all this stuff, yeah.

MIKE:
And he, he yells:

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

MIKE:
And it's like this wide shot.
And he says it so strangely that I...

JAY:
He says every line strangely.

MIKE:
I know.
But it's, it didn't even sound like him.

JAY:
Oh...

MIKE:
And I thought it was ADR done by, like, a Jeff Goldblum sound-alike.

JAY:
They couldn't get him back that day?

MIKE:
And then, like, like, Colin Trevorrow wasn't around.
And there, then some guy was in the booth, going...
And he goes...
And the actor just goes:
"Unforeseen circumstances occur!"
And they're, like:
"Sure."

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

MIKE:
All right.
We're done.
I just had...
I have these fantasies in my head of how things really went.
And, and, and it was...
It just struck me
And then there's inserts.
Kayla, when a dinosaur appears to attack them...

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
She says:
"Nope!"

KAYLA WATTS:
"Nope!"

MIKE:
And turns and runs.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And it, it was very clearly inserted.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
Like, like, in an, like:
"We gotta have something funny."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then Owen Thunderguns says:
"What an asshole."

OWEN GRADY:
What an asshole.

COACHMAN:
What an asshole.

MIKE:
And, uh, referring to the dinosaur as it falls under the ice.

JAY:
I don't remember any of this.
Is this all in that ice scene?

MIKE:
Yeah.
His back is to the camera, and he turns around, and he's like...
I think she's mid-turn when she says:
"Nope."
But you could see that her mouth isn't moving.

JAY:
Okay.

KAYLA WATTS:
Nope!

JAY:
So it has that, uh, Ghostbusters 2016 syndrome?
Where it's like:
"We have to keep adding funny things everywhere."

MIKE:
Yeah.
We need some quips, because this, this ice scene is dull.
And then, and then, uh, they escape dino.
They get in some kind of elevator?
The door closes.
And then they're like...
They're just, like, bored?
And then he's like:
"Are you good?"
And then she goes:
"Ehh, I'm good."
And then I, I think it was supposed to be read as like:
"We just went through this harrowing nightmarish experience where we barely escaped with our lives."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Are you cool?"
"Yeah, I'm cool."
Like, like where they're both really terrified, but they're both trying to play it cool to each other.

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
But to me, it read as the characters are just...
Or the actors are just, whatever.

JAY:
Well, that, that's how I felt through most of the movie.
Especially with the, like, legacy characters.
Like, Laura Dern looks like she doesn't know what the fuck is going on, whenever there's any action happening.
Which makes the, uh, the, the big scene where they all finally meet.
All of our legacy characters and our new Jurassic World characters, they finally meet.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
They're all in the frame together.
And I think it's supposed to be, like, a magical movie moment, but everybody's just bored.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Nobody cares.

SAM NEILL:
I've kind of fallen in love with Colin.
I just, I just think, you know, his, his enthusiasm, his energy, his boundless optimism...
He loves these films.
He loves directing.
He loves the actors.
You know, he's, he's just...

MIKE:
And then, like, because they solved the locust problem, we cut to a montage at the end where we're back to our Instagram, uh, TikTok news reporter explaining the plot.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And, like, we have nature footage of animals just living in harmony with dinosaurs.
"We're just going to have to live with them."
And I'm like:
"Again."
Uh...

JAY:
Nothing's been accomplished in the movie!
The locusts were stopped.
But it's still, yeah.
"We still haven't learned anything."

MIKE:
From a science perspective -- and I know this isn't, this isn't real life, this movie -- but you, you bring over one weird lizard from a foreign country to the U.S., and it cripples the entire ecosystem of an entire state.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Because they multiple.
They eat food supplies that belong to some other creature, which causes that creature to, to either starve out, which was the food of a different creature taht ate this plant...
And it causes, like, a domino effect.
Having dinosaurs, like, everywhere, living in harmony with nature is just, like, batshit unrealistic.
They, but they show, like, elephant herds walking alongisde, like, those other big dinosaurs.
Triceratops.
They're like, like, co-existing.
And then, like, seagulls are flying with pterodactyls.
And I'm just, like:
"Mm-mmm."
So, I'm like...

JAY:
I, I wouldn't mind any of the stupidity as long as it was fun.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It was a slog.

JAY:
The movie's a slog.

MIKE:
It was a slog.

JAY:
Like I said, that, that whole sequence, uh, the Mission: Impossible sequence where they, they find the underground, uh, dinosaur fights.
And they have a chase through the streets, where the dinosaurs are chasing them.
Like, at least that's kind of taking advantage of the concept of the movie.
And that's kind of it.
And then the rest of it's, just, yeah...
Overstuffed with subplots and characters.
"We gotta put this in there."
"We gotta put that in there."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
It just feels like checkking off boxes of things you're supposed to put in the movie.
Out of curiosity, I looked at, like, the three Jurassic World films.
And it's a, it's a, it's textbook example of diminishing returns, both in critical reception and box office.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Worldwide.

JAY:
I would assume that, yeah, this one's...
I think it still did pretty well, though, right?

MIKE:
Uh, yes.
I have a graphic here.
And I don't quite remember the exact numbers.
But I wanna say the first one, uh, $1.3 or $1.6 billion worldwide.

JAY:
The first one did really well.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And, uh, because it was a fairly solid movie in terms of a reboot.

JAY:
It, it was like a crowd-pleaser.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And it did well at the box office.
But, uh, a lot of people hate it.

MIKE:
Well, sure.

JAY:
I didn't like it.
Uh, you famously -- or infamously -- gave it a good review.
And people were kind of baffled.
You know, it was like you said.
It was meta.
Sort of self-aware.
And it had the fun of a theme park falling apart.
Just on a grander scale than the first one.

JAY:
Com-, compared to the sequels, it feels, like, so much more cohesive and quaint.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
The second one, though...
I have never stopped thinking about that second movie because it is so bizarrely stupid.
Uh, that movie should be, like, a cult classic.
The whole second half taking place in the spooky mansion with, uh, illegal black market dinosaur auctions underneath it.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's, that's where they start to get into this, this idea of what, what would people do if dinosaurs were everywhere.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Accessible, not just a theme park.
And, and they kind of fucked that up, making, like, a smart movie series about it.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Which you're not gonna expect in this day and age.
The second one, I think scraped out just over a billion worldwide.
And then this third one, uh, in the $900 millions.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
So, I mean, obviously, that's a lot of money, but there's the cost of the film, the promotion, and all that kind of stuff, so...
But another thing to factor into is that first and second one were pre-pandemic...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And this one, I think was a pandemic delay, maybe?

JAY:
I think so.

MIKE:
But still, it was, like, probably released at a time when people were, like:
"Ehh, I don't know about going to the movie theaters."

JAY:
That, and they're probably just tired of it, like:
"Oh, another Jurassic World movie?"

MIKE:
And, and fatigue, yeah.
And it's, and, or...
It could've worked to the movie's favor, where the people that did go to the theater who wanna pay what they pay at movie theaters have an option between watching nothing, or Jurassic World: Dominion.
"Hey, we're gonna pay..."
"If we're gonna pay the prices that we pay at the movie theater, why not watch a two-hour-and-thirty-minute long dinosaur movie?"
Like...

JAY:
There's a lot of stuff in the movie.

MIKE:
There's a lot of stuff in the movie.
Uh, rather than watching a 90-minute arthouse film.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
Most, maximum amount of dinosaurs in the movie that we're making.
There have never been more dinosaurs.

CHRIS PRATT:
We truly have spared no expense.
We have amazing action sequences.
We have amazing dinosaur sequences.
We have heart, humor, innovative technology.
Both as like, um, a storypoint in the film, but also...

SAM NEILL:
And epic in...

JEFF GOLDBLUM:
I'll tell you.
Colin.
That Colin Trevorrow.
He's good.
He's a good director.

CHRIS PRATT:
As a narrative around making this film, we're pioneering brand new technologies to make this film.
We have more dinosaurs than you've ever seen in a Jurassic film.

SAM NEILL:
Uh...

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
Like, maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie.

CHRIS PRATT:
New dinosaurs.
New characters.
You know, you look up into the stars, and you think:
"That's 13 billion light years away."
Like, how does...
How is that possible?
That couldn't...
You couldn't...

MIKE:
It was a slog.
It was uninteresting.

JAY:
All's I know is I never ever wanna see another character in a movie do this anymore.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
It made sense in the first movie, because Chris Pratt's training those dinosaurs, and it's part of his move for training.
But now he just does it anytime he sees any dinosaur anywhere.

MIKE:
And, and other people can do it, too.

JAY:
And other people just do it.
And it works, I guess?
I'ma try that move the next time I'm attacked by a dinosaur.

MIKE:
There you go.
There you go.
Yeah.

OWEN GRADY:
I am gonna get her back.
No!

MIKE:
Guns N' Roses present Thor: Love and Thunder, aka Thor 4: More Thor, starring Natalie Portman as Thor.
In this newest Thor film...

THOR:
Yeah, right.

MIKE:
So, Jay, in this newest Thor film...

JAY:
Uh, well...
They checked off a whole bunch of boxes.
Speaking of the last movie, where it just feels like a checklist.
Uh, this movie feels like Taika Waititi was contractually obligated to make another Thor.

TAIKA WAITITI:
We were all in it.

TESSA THOMPSON:
We were all in it.

TAIKA WAITITI:
We were all in it together.

JAY:
He didn't want to make another Thor, so he said:
"I'm just gonna make it a bunch of goofy nonsense."
And then Kevin Feige said:
"You have to have lady Thor in it."
So they're like:
"That's what we're gonna do."
"You're gonna do Mighty Thor."
Which is Jane Foster as Thor.
And, uh, Taika Waititi is like:
"I just wanna make a bunch of dumb nonsense."
"I just wanna make a goofy movie."
And they're like:
"Well, you gotta put that in it."
"You gotta put Gorr the god killer in it."
Who is, like, the most serious and tense bad guy ever.
But you gotta shove him into a movie that's nothing but dumb jokes.
How does that work?
Oh, not very well, apparently.

MIKE:
Dang.

JAY:
I, I was really annoyed by this movie.

MIKE:
Wow.
Uh...

JAY:
Normally, I like...
We've, we've praised, in the past, uh, when a filmmaker kind of intentionally throws his own movie...
Uh, Gremlins 2, of course, is the, uh...

MIKE:
Throws his own movie.

JAY:
The gold standard for this kind of thing, but...

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
We were pretty positive on Matrix 4.
A lot of people didn't like that.
Uh, those are movies that are doing something interesting with the idea of, uh, kind of making fun of your own franchise.
They kind of...
They're about that.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And this movie just feels like Taika Waititi didn't want to make it, so he intentionally just made it a huge joke.

TAIKA WAITITI:
So, in this moment you were there.

TESSA THOMPSON:
Yeah.

TAIKA WAITITI:
You're getting out.
You go like this.
And she goes...

TESSA THOMPSON:
She goes...

JAY:
But then he still had to shove in those Marvel elements...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That are more serious.
And, so he didn't go all the way with it.
And it's not really saying anything.
It's just a bunch of goofy nonsense.

MIKE:
What other Taika Waititi movies has he made?

JAY:
He did What We Do in the Shadows.

MIKE:
No, no, no.
In the Marvel world.
Nothing?

JAY:
Uh, just the last Thor.
Thor:Ragnorok.

MIKE:
Thor:Ragnorok.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.

JAY:
Which I think found a good balance of everything.

MIKE:
Well, that's the thing.
That's the big takeaway from this is balance.
Um, because Thor is now a comedic character.

THOR:
We can collectively take credit for that because we worked as a team.
We used our hearts and our minds to defeat the enemy, with minimal loss or damage.

MIKE:
Where he's a very serious, uh, demi-god.
A Norse demi-god of...
"I'm Thor, the God of Thunder!"
"Isn't it funny when..."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"I do this?"

JAY:
Lots of fish-out-of-water jokes in the first movie.

MIKE:
Sure.

JAY:
I think we've mentioned this before.
But as the franchise has gone along, they realized that Chris Hemsworth's actually pretty funny.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
So they make him more comedic.
And in this one, they turn him into Homer Simpson, basically.

MIKE:
He's, uh, he's actually Space Cop in the first scene.

JAY:
That's true.

MIKE:
He, he shows, shows up to help, and he causes more damage than necessary.

JAY:
Yeah.
Which is a fun sequence.
I didn't hate everything in this movie.

MIKE:
It's that imaginary line you have to ride where Thor is a joke when he needs to be, but then Thor is serious when the movie needs him to be serious.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
i.e., you throw in cancer in this movie, and it does not gel with the tone.

JAY:
Not just throw it in.
Hard cut from over-the-top comedic scene to chemotherapy.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
Boom!
Oh, my god!
What did we just do?

MIKE:
Yes.
Because that's the history of the lady Thor character, so...

JAY:
Yeah.
And that's what I say, when it's like:
"Well, we gotta put this in here."
"Ehh, I'm just gonna rush through it as much as possible."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because anything with her having cancer just feels so brushed over.
When that should be a pretty heavy, uh, dramatic stakes of your movie.

MIKE:
I mean, there's a lot of things that are smartly done in this.
Like, it opens with him in the desert.
You know, their, their world is dead or dying.
And him and his daughter are thirsty.
And they're dying.

JAY:
The last of their race, right?

MIKE:
The last of their race.
Yeah.
And then it opens, like, you're panning up on desert.
And, and then the very end of the movie, they're in this big field of water.
So there's, there's a little, like, full circle-ness to that, because he finds the, the space god.
Um...
Oh, yeah.
Spoilers on everything.

JAY:
Nobody cares.

MIKE:
Uh, it's been so long since these movies came out.
We don't give a fuck.
He wants to grant...
He's so angry at the gods because...
And that's funny, too.
It's, like, you have this emotional heart-wrenching scene where his daughter dies.
And then he finds this oasis where the gods live.
And the god is this horrible asshole.

JAY:
He's just mocking him, yeah.

MIKE:
All the gods are assholes.
And then, so you're like...

JAY:
Which is good in concept.
I think the execution, again...
That tonal whiplash.

MIKE:
Tonal whiplash, yeah.

JAY:
If it was just him in the desert, that'd be one thing.
But we just saw his daughter die.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
And it's...
So it's like all of a sudden the god is super goofy and comedic.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
It's like, ugh.

RAPU:
We just vanquished the holder of the Necrosword before he could harm any other gods with that cursed blade.

MIKE:
And so, you're setting up your villain's backstory and motivation, and almost some sympathy for him.
But then he gets the sword.
And then he gets corrupted and vengeful because the sword is the god killer sword.
And it can slay gods.
And so, not just his own god on his own planet, but he wants to go, go after all of them.
And this becomes a problem for Thor because Thor is a god.

JAY:
It's a good setup for your villain.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And that's what we always complain...
That a lot of these Marvel movies, the weakest aspect is the villain.
Here, the villain's good.
He's got good backstory.
He's played by a very good actor who's taken his job super seriously.
And he's just in the wrong movie.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
It's so bizarre.

MIKE:
He's in the wrong movie.
Jane with cancer is in the wrong movie.
Chris Hemsworth is in half of the wrong movie.

JAY:
Depending on the scene.

MIKE:
He, he knows how to, like...
He's perfect.
He knows how to do the, do the comedy, and then kind of, like, gently segueing it into:
"Okay, Thor has to be serious now."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And he works, but it's...
A lot of the other elements seemed kind of all over the place.
Like, a lot of the humor, I liked.
I really liked the scene where they go to the god city, and Russell Crowe is Zeus.

JAY:
That's, well, that's where it's like:
"We're just goofing around."

MIKE:
That's, yeah.

JAY:
And Russell Crowe is...
I don't know what his accent is, but he's very funny.

MIKE:
He's trying to do a Greek accent.

JAY:
I don't know if it works, but it's, it's, but it's funny.

MIKE:
But he's Australian, so...
Yeah.
He's a little garbled and, and muddy.

JAY:
Well, that adds to it.
And that's again, that attitude of like:
"Ehh, fuck it."
"I don't really care what we're doing."
"We're just goofing around here."

MIKE:
Right, right, right.

JAY:
That's, that's where they go full-force into that.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Um, so scenes like that are fine.
The screaming goats...

THOR:
All right.
Everybody just relax.
The goats are gonna be fine.
If not, we can just use them for meat.

JAY:
They really...
I was thinking of the, uh, uh, David Pumpkin sketch with Tom Hanks on SNL.

DAVID PUMPKIN:
How's it hanging?
I'm David Pumpkins!

JAY:
It's like:
"Why'd you go all in on David Pumpkins?"
Because, man, they seem to think those screaming goats are hilarious.

DAVID PUMPKINS:
Any questions?

JAY:
It's funny at first.
And then they just keep doing it.

MIKE:
So then the general premise is Gorr -- the god killer, god slayer, with the sword, the magic sword -- that just exists.
I'm sure it's in the comic books.

JAY:
It's fine.
It's comic book stuff.

MIKE:
It's like:
"Hey, there's a new thing!"

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He wants to get to an entity who lives in the center of the universe, called Eternity, that can grant a wish.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Uh, and in order to get to the entity, he needs to open up a secret gate, which the symbol on the gate is the Bifrost symbol.
So he needs Thor's magic axe to open up the gate in this temple to lead him to Eternity so that he can grant, uh, so that Eternity can grant him the wish to eliminate all of the gods in the universe.
Uh, and of course, Thor has to stop them.
But in order to lure Thor and friends, he kidnaps a bunch of children from New Asgaard, uh, as bait.

JAY:
Who apparently aren't aware that they're in a movie.
In all those scenes where they're captured in, like, their, their cage, those kids are just, like, smiling and bored.
They don't look like they're in a movie.

GORR:
Oh!
Oh!
Oh...

MIKE:
Are they doing the lightsaber thing with the...
Looking at the camera.

JAY:
"Oh, oh, oh!"

MIKE:
Yeah, and there's some fun stuff.
Thor astrally projects himself there.
He says all the wrong things in front of the kids.
He doesn't quite know how to talk to them.

JAY:
Yeah.

KID:
I can't believe you killed Zeus!

THOR:
Well, you know what they say.
Never meet your heroes.

MIKE:
Uh, it's...

JAY:
There's a fun bit where he's trying to talk to 'em, and, uh, what's her face, Tessa Thompson is, like, tickling his nose.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So the whole time he's doing this.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
It was like:
"Ehh, this is kind of funny."

MIKE:
I mean, obviously Taika Waitiki...

JAY:
Waititi.

MIKE:
Waititi?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Taika Waititi.
Sorry.

TAIKA WAITITI:
Hey, everyone.
I'm Taika Waititi.

MIKE:
I don't know how to say his name.
I never said it before.
Uh, knows how to bring the funny.
Uh, even though you don't like him personally.

JAY:
Uh, well...
I guess there's, like, a mini controversy around this movie when it was coming out in theaters.
He was doing the promotional rounds, where he just really came across -- and this comes across in the movie -- where he just didn't take anything seriously.
And I know he's a comedic person.
But it just felt like he was...
He did, like, a Vogue or Vanity Fair or something, where he was doing a breakdown from a scene in the movie.
It's him and Tessa Thompson.

TAIKA WAITITI:
Hey, everyone.
I'm Taika Waititi.

TESSA THOMPSON:
And I'm Tessa Thompson.

TAIKA WAITITI:
And we're here to, from Thor: Love and Thunder.

JAY:
And he's just like:
"Ah, the special effects in this scene aren't very good..."
And just, like, you know, if you're...
Self-depcrecating is one thing, but this was right around the time that all the articles and stories were coming out about how the, the effects artists for these movies are horribly overworked, deadlines are constantly, and all these things.

TAIKA WAITITI:
Does that look real?

TESSA THOMPSON:
In that particular shot?
No, actually.

JAY:
Like, maybe leave that alone.
Make fun of your direction.
He just came across like he didn't give a shit about the movie.
Like, eh, like, too cool for it, almost.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
I found that very off-putting, as opposed to someone like James Gunn, who is...
His movies are comedic.
They also have a tough time balancing tones.
I think he does it much better.
And then Taika Waititi just feels like:
"Ehh, I did that Thor: Ragnarok movie."
"I had a concept for that, so we made that movie."
"And now I guess I gotta make another one."

TESSA THOMPSON:
It's because it used to be, when he would wake up, that was my reaction show.
But you just left it randomly.
You said that...

TAIKA WAITITI:
I never noticed it!
I was never looking at you.

TESSA THOMPSON:
Trust me.
I did.

TAIKA WAITITI:
We called it a day.
We were like...

TESSA THOMPSON:
And I'd be like...

TAIKA WAITITI:
How big do you want the dick?
And then, what happens?
You take that footage.
You put it into the computer, and you have little bits of, like, blue light mixed up in it, and it's...

MIKE:
I didn't really like when Thor just said:
"I can give all my Thor powers to children."
"I can just hand out my Thor powers to anyone temporarily."

JAY:
That, that's news to me that that's a power that he has.

MIKE:
Would've been helpful during that battle against Thanos.
Just zap out all of Thor's powers to everybody.
It seemed a little, like, uh...

JAY:
Well, we can't have just Thor beating the bad guy.

MIKE:
Right.
It would've been to me more exciting if the kids were all in danger and hiding and barely escaping and hiding under this and that and Thor was, like, fighting furiously to protect them at every cost, you know?

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Um, but instead, it seemed lazy.
It seemed like a convenience.
A plot convenience.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Like they just made it up.
"Oh, he just hands out his powers."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Here's where someone tells us he can hand out his powers.
It's in Thor issue #382.

JAY:
I mean, that's fine if that's a power, but...

MIKE:
Movie-wise...

JAY:
You don't just pull that out of your ass at the end of a movie.

MIKE:
Movie-wise, it felt like it was pulled out, out of his ass.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Out of the movie's ass.
And like you said, I don't know if that's true, if that, you know, Marvel people said:
"You gotta have this."
"You gotta have this."

JAY:
I don't, I don't know if that's actually the case.
That's what it, that's what it felt like.
Because he made that first Thor movie.
He did a good job.
And he went off and made his Jojo Rabbit.
It's like one of those one-for-them-one-for-me kind of situations.
Like:
"Oh, fuck."
"Now I gotta go back and make another Thor movie."

MIKE:
All I know is, the man created a little movie called What We Do in the Shadows.
And, and, uh, the TV show is probably the best thing I've seen in a very, very long time.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
And when we finally understand why the movie's called that, it's because he's got the little girl with him now.
And you're like:
"Yeah, but who's this little girl?"
Like, I know it's Gorr's daughter, but...
That kind of just happened.
"Here, have my daughter as I die."

MIKE:
Well, I, I thought the ending was kind of sweet.

JAY:
We needed, we needed...
I know, obviously she dies at the beginning of the movie.
But we need something more with that daughter.
Just the idea of like:
"Oh, I'm gonna...take your daughter now."

MIKE:
Well...

JAY:
It just felt so, like, rushed, compared to everything else.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean, if, if there was some kind of logic to it, it would be, like, uh, like a soul for a soul kind of situation, like...

JAY:
I mean, I get it, yeah, thematically what they're doing.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Story-wise.

MIKE:
Jane, Jane had to die in order to save the little girl, which, which disarmed the enemy.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
The bad guy wouldn't wish for, um...
Because I don't know, I don't know the, the, the rules of the Eternity character.
But the bad guy chose love over hate.
And, uh, decided not to kill all the gods if, if the thing would resurrect his daughter.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
But he had to die, and then Jane had to die, and then they, um...
Thor was stuck with the little girl, which I thought was fun.
He's got a raise a kid.
And she's part-god now.
And they're now Thor: Love and Thunder.
They're a team.
And they run around and save planets.
It's a whole new adventure, Jay.

JAY:
I can't wait for her Disney+ series that I won't watch.

MIKE:
You, you are, you are more of an old man than me.

JAY:
That's not true!

MIKE:
I have some spark of hope left in me.
Like you said, issues with it.
Inconsistency with tone.
Uh, logic.
Uh, what-are-we-doing, you know...
Did you watch the post-credits stuff?

JAY:
Oh.
Uh, there's something with, uh, uh, Russell Crowe at the very end.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I was excited about that.

JAY:
Well, that just means he didn't die.
Which I guess is good, because it was a little fucked up that Thor just kills him.
It's like:
"Oh, okay."
"He didn't die."

MIKE:
Thor kills Zeus

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, like, I was like:
"That's a little unlikely."
And Zeus is, like, there with this hole in his chest.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He's like:
"I'm fine, but, uh, I realize that us as gods, we've, we've become a joke."
"And it's time to bring back our wrath and make them fear us again."
And he goes:
"Hercules!"
And then they pan over, and, uh, it's the guy from the fucking Ted Lasso show.

JAY:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
You ever watch that show?

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
It's a bunch of, bunch of crap.

JAY:
Everybody loves that show, Mike!

MIKE:
It sucks so bad.

MAVERICK:
Here we go.
In 3...
2...
Whoa!
1...

JAY:
Tom Cruise returns as the character of Top Gun.
The first film came out 62 years ago, and had a homoerotic volleyball scene.
This new film is updated for a hip, new audience by having a homoerotic foobtall scene.
Oh, and there's ladies now.
So it's not quite as homoerotic, unfortunately.
The movie also has a soundtrack filled with Dad Rock.
And it's, like, the fifth-highest grossing movie of all time.
In the film, Tom Gun has to has to teach a class of pilots how to fly their planes more betterer.
And how to bomb a lunch box at the base of a valley.
It's a dangerous and complicated flight path, with little chance for survival.
Hey, don't drones exist now?

 JAY:
I watched Top Gun: Maverick, which I had zero interest in.
And within 20 minutes, I was like:
"Hey, this feels like a real movie!"
And it was very exciting.

MIKE:
Yeah, I...
My, my reaction to it...
Like, I had no interest in it because I saw...
I think I saw the original Top Gun a long time ago.

JAY:
I've seen it once.
And I remember thinking it was fine.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's just not my thing.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, ehh...
It's like race cars.
Race cars and airplanes, I don't care about.
He, he is an adrenaline junkie, that man.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Um, but...

JAY:
This is a movie that would not be made today if it wasn't for the star power, the still-exsiting star power of Tom Cruise.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And it's not just star power.
It's, like, uh...

JAY:
Well, influence, or...

MIKE:
Influence.
Uh, obsession for perfection.

TOM CRUISE:
It's very important to me that it be practical.
I said I'm not gonna unless we can accomplish that.

MIKE:
Uh, he's, like, the real deal when it comes to, like, insane, like:
"I'm gonna get this done, hell or high water."

JAY:
Practical stunts.

MIKE:
Yes.
And that's the, uh, the big thing.
But it's not distracting.
I think there was one, like, one of the Mission: Impossible mvoies where he's hanging under a helicopter or plane.
And he's climbing on something.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They've got cameras under there, where they're, like...
You could tell they're, like, filming through this thing.
And then, that looks like...
It was impressive.
But you could tell, like, that the way he, the way that it was shot was not cinematic.
It looked more like documentary footage, because...

JAY:
That's the only way they could shoot it or something?

MIKE:
Yes.
But, but this doesn't feel that way.

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
And all those actors are really in jets, flying around, and, uh...
I read a little bit about it.
They had to go through training, and they were always throwing up.
And, um, they, they were required, once the plane took off, the actors themselves were required to run the camera...

JAY:
Yeah.
I saw that.

MIKE:
Do their own makeup.
Kind of...
Because no one could communicate with them, and, and...
And so, pretty intense, like, unusual filiming circumstances in order to make this.
And then they filmed a bunch of stuff and they come back down to look at it, and they're like:
"Nope!"
"Do it again."
"Oh, fuck!"

JAY:
Yeah.
I saw Miles Teller talking about one time, they had to redo a whole scene because he just didn't record, hit record on the camera or something.

MIKE:
Right, right, right.

JAY:
So it's, like...
But, yeah.
That's the selling point of the movie is that these are real things happening.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
We don't have, uh, a little cockpit set and a green screen.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
You know, the lighting makes it look completely unrealistic and unnatural.
Like, you make a movie like this because that's what the movie is.

MIKE:
Yes.
And, and as far as the story goes, all the things necesary to make a movie blockbuster...
It was done with, like, the, the pinpoint precision of a, of a guided bomb.
Laser-guided bomb.
Like, everything.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And, and it's almost like...
It's certainly...
I don't know if you want to call this a soft reboot, or a sequel that came 36 years later.

JAY:
I mean, it's definitely one of those.
"Legacy sequels" is what they say now.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Because it's, like, the beats are all there.
He's, he's the instructor now.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
There's the group of hot-shot pilots.
He's got the love interest.
Um...

JAY:
We get the shirtless, uh, sports scene.

MIKE:
All the famous scenes.
The, the, you know...

JAY:
At the beginning of the movie, I thought I was watching the first movie.
I thought I fucked up somehow.
Because we get all the shot of the plane.
And, like, the font of the credits.

MIKE:
Same opening.
Yeah.

JAY:
And then the Highway to the Danger Zone song.
I was like:
"Did I put on the first movie somehow?"

MIKE:
Yeah.
There's two, two changes I learned in the opening title thing.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
It's like:
"So the Air Force blah blah blah program."
And, um, it, it said, uh, it says...
Before it said "the men of this fighter.."
It now says "men and women".

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
And it says:
"In order to, to insure the best pilots in the world..."
It was spelled "i-n-s-u-r-e".

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
And they changed it to "e-n".

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
They, they fucked up the first time.

MAVERICK:
Tower, this is Dark Star. We are taxiing with information Alpha.

TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
Dark Star, you are clear to taxi.
Runway 21.

MIKE:
He hit all these points.
Like, all the points, right
Flies in a super modern plane.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
The most modern-ist of modern planes.
I thought it was a, uh, SR-71 Blackbird when they showed it.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
And I was like:
"Oh, cool!"
But I think that's been retired.
It's like a spy plane.

JAY:
I know nothing about planes, so...

MIKE:
It's what the X-Men fly around in.

JAY:
Oh!

MIKE:
It looks like that.
It's a big black plane, and it's meant for, like, dodging radar.
So it's, like, one of those.
And, and he has to get to Mach-10.

JAY:
He's trying to see if he can, yeah, make it to Mach-10.

MIKE:
And, uh, and, uh...

JAY:
He pushes it a little too far because he doesn't play by the rules.

MIKE:
Because he's Tom Cruise!

JAY:
Because he's Top Gun!

MIKE:
Right.
And, um...

JAY:
And that part when it first takes off...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And the, uh...
We have that wide shot on the ground.
And that, the roof of that building comes off.
That wasn't supposed to happen.

MIKE:
Right.
Yeah.

JAY:
And so it's, like:
"Oh, that's great!"

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Like, real things happen.
This wasn't a CG plane.

MIKE:
They're like:
"We can't do it again."
It's too expensive to do it again, because they're flying a real hi-tech jet.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So you have hi-tech jets that exist.
Um, but in the movie, they have to use slightly older planes.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Probably because, in the logic of the real world, they couldn't just give the production of this movie ten, like, super expensive, high-quality, top-of-the-line fighter jets to use for Tom Cruise to play with in his movie.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
"We'll give you 5-10 jets to shoot with, and the pilots that will pilot them."
But they're not gonna be, like...
They're gonna be a few years old.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
And that also adds into the storyline, because they have to do this mission.
And the, the bad guys have more advanced jets.
So that adds a little threat there.

JAY:
Do they ever establish where they go?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
I don't think they do, right?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Because they know:
"Can't get away with that."
"Wherever we put it, it's gonna offend somebody."

MIKE:
Well, they, they don't in the first one, either.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
It's, it's just, like, non-descript bad guy.

JAY:
Because it doesn't really matter.

MIKE:
It doesn't really matter.
And it doesn't matter to the, um, the pilots.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They're, they're all about performing their mission with precision.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And getting out safely.
So the, the global politics of it doesn't matter to them from, from...
That's, like, the only...
If I had to pick a really small thing, that would be the only thing.
It would be like:
"Well, if this crazy country..."
I'm gonna assume it was North Korea.
I'll explain in a minute.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Um, uh...
"If this crazy country does something with the nukes, they're gonna, they plan to blah blah blah."
But, but the threat was that they had an underground nuclear reactor that was gonna go online.
And they're gonna start enriching uranium.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And once uranium's enriched, that's when it becomes, like, dangerous when you blow it up.  
It causes all sorts of damage.
So there's a threat.
But if they establish the, the importance of that threat, maybe it would've helped a little bit.
But really, the story was about the character.

JAY:
It's about the personal stakes.

MIKE:
The personal stakes, and the characters coming home alive.
And Tom Cruise, uh, learning, uh, trying to get Goose's son -- played by Miles Teller -- uh, to trust him again, and forgive him for the death of his father.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So that's really the story.
Um, and that's the important part, but...
Uh, the bad guy's have that, like, weird fake logo on their plane.
And you never see them.

JAY:
They just have the helmets.

MIKE:
You don't wanna show some, like, Korean guy.

JAY:
You can't show anyone.
But I guess, yeah.
I forgot that that was an element of the first movie, too.
So it's like:
"Okay."
"Well, that carries over."

MIKE:
It worked.

JAY:
I only saw the first Top Gun once.
I've seen Hot Shots, like, 50 times.

VOICEOVER:
Call them...

OFFICER:
At ease!

VOICEOVER:
Hot Shots!
The mother of all movies!

MIKE:
In this movie, they fly over water off of the aircraft carrier, and they enter, like, snowy peaked mountains.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
North Korea...
The north of it is very rocky, and snowy mountainous, so...
You probably...
It's probably Kim Jong-un making nukes.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
Wink, wink.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That's the one country you can offend is North Korea.
You don't worry about their box office returns.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
You don't wanna offend China.
Uh, and there was controversy early on about his patch on his jacket, so it was, like, country-neutral to not offend China, blah blah blah.

JAY:
They, like digitally removed it?

MIKE:
Uh, I think just changed it from the same patch that he had in the first movie.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MIKE:
I'll have to look this up.
And I'll, like, put up a story about it somewhere.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
So you can read it.
Because I don't really care that much about it.
But...
So that's fine, but, um, the, you know...
The movie bounces back and forth between regular film and IMAX.
So you know the action and excitement's coming when your aspect ratio gets wider.

JAY:
It's the old Christopher Nolan trick, yeah.
And it's great.
This is one movie where...
I didn't give a shit about it when it came out.
And I was like:
"I don't care about another Top Gun."
But, uh, now I'm like:
"Ah, I kind of wish I would've seen it in the theater."

MIKE:
In the theater.

JAY:
It would've looked great.
Well, that's the thing is, like, story-wise, it's fine.
It does enough of what you need to do to establish the, the, uh, uh, what's his...
Rooster, right?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Goose's son.
And Tom Cruise.
Their kind of history.
Uh, and it's fine.
It does that well enough.
But then you get to the third act, which is just all action.
And it's legitimately exciting to watch, which I can't say...
Usually by the time you get to the third act of a lot of bigger movies now, I'm just like:
"When is it over?"

MIKE:
Right.
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Jurassic World.
Like, how long...
It just keeps going.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
And here, it's, like, rejuvenates the movie.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
And, uh, you mention that it takes place in a snowy landscape.
It's like a nice visual change of pace from where we've been the rest of the movie.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
So that helps, too.

MIKE:
Yeah.
They're practicing in, like, California...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Or Nevada or something, where they can fly around in canyons and practice.

JAY:
The only thing that it probably didn't need was a love interest.
But that's one of those:
"Well, you gotta put that in there."

MIKE:
Ehh...

JAY:
"You gotta put that in there."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
We're not gonna bring back, uh, Kelly McGillis from the first movie.
I'm not saying anything personal about her, but I know the way Hollywood thinks.
They're not casting her again.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I, I guess...

JAY:
We'll cast Jennifer Connolly, who was, like, twelve when the first movie came out.

MIKE:
She's about ten years younger than Tom Cruise.
Tom Cruise just celebrated his 60th birthday.
Jennifer Connelly's in her early 50's.
So it's not, like, absurd, age-wise.
But I know what you mean.

JAY:
But you know why it's in there.

MIKE:
You know why it's in there.
And that's kind of disappointing because, um, Kelly McGillis kind of looks like a grandma now.
But, you know, Jennifer Connelly, of course, aged well, um, and...
So it's like:
"Well, we have to have a love interest, but we can't bring back Kelly McGillis."
I think she was the instructor in the first movie.

JAY:
Uh, Kelly McGillis?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Something like that.

MIKE:
And, and so they had a little romance.
So, and so it would be weird if she came back to...
Because he's the instructor now.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Logically, it makes sense, but you know the reason why.
Tom Cruise looks like he's 30.
And you don't want him smooching on a grandma.
And he doesn't want to do that.

ICE:
You can be my wingman anytime.

MAVERICK:
Bullshit.
You can be mine.

MIKE:
It had all those, like, beats.
Because I think...
Wasn't Tom Cruise and Val Kimer kind of, like, adversaries?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, Iceman.
And then they learned to be friends at the end.
And that's kind of like the Hangman character in this.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
With Rooster.
You know, it's all very self-aware that they're repeating the first movie.
Just doing it on a grander, more bigger visual scale.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
With more modern technology.
And, uh...

JAY:
Well, that's...
It's a prime example of, like:
"It's not necessarily the story you're telling."
"It's how you tell it."

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
And if this was a bunch of people on green screens, like, none of it would've worked."

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
You mentioned Val Kilmer comes back.
And, obviously, he's limited with what he can do now.
And I think they handled that pretty well.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Um, they worked it into the story.
Uh, and I like that there seems to be a history in-between the first movie and this one.

MIKE:
Mm.

JAY:
As opposed to a lot of these movies, where they bring back the characters from the original, and it's, like, they've done nothing between movies.
Uh, their whole life exists in that first movie, and then they just stop.
Jurassic World, you can kind of say that about.

MIKE:
Han Solo.

JAY:
Sam Neill.
Han Solo.
But in this one, it's like, yeah, he has a history with Jennifer Connelly with their kid.
And it's all kind of established without going overboard on exposition.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
But it's there.

MIKE:
And with, uh, Rooster.
Miles Teller and his mother.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Played by Meg Ryan in the first one, who has died in-between the two films.
And she told Tom Cruise:
"Don't let him get into fighter piloting."
"He's gonna get blowed up."
Um, and so, like, he delays his, his admittance to the Naval Academy, because that's what the wishes of his mother was.
But Tom Cruise doesn't tell him that.

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
So that adds some drama.

ROOSTER:
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?
Why did you stand in my way?

MIKE:
Effective.
Even the corny, kind of predictable plot things all worked.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Just because it, it's just like:
"This is the movie we're making."
"We're making a big summer blockbuster movie about fighter jets.
"Um, and we're doing it exactly precisely the way it needs to be done..."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Without overdoing elements."
"Without being, getting too stupid."
"Um, and, and we're really gonna focus on high-quality action sequences."

MAVERICK:
Heads up, Phoenix.

BOB:
Whoa!

MIKE:
But, yeah.
They, they, they go on their, their adventure at the end.
They, they train for it.
I think that's, that's what makes the ending effective is that you know the stakes.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Not just the nuclear bad guys getting nuclear power, or uranium.
But the difficulty of the mission.
And it's all very, explained very clearly how it's down to time and seconds.
And they have to perform all these maneuvers.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
They, they're getting 8-10 G's flying up out of this canyon.
It's, like, perfectly-designed, like, mission that's super difficult.
And you could...
I'm sure some people hated this movie because they hate Tom Cruise.
"He's an egomanic, and he wins in the end and thinks he's so awesome."

JAY:
Hey, he's responsible for getting a movie, multiple movies at this point made that have, like, real action scenes in it that are excting to watch because you know they're real.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
All those Mission: Impossible movies.
There's some great stuff in there.
Especially coming after watching Thor and, and Jurassic World.
Which just feels so phony.
It feels like you're watching a, like a, I dunno, fast food commercial or something.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
That just goes on for two-and-a-half hours.

MIKE:
Right.
But, uh, they, yeah...
They, they do their mission.
It's fucking exciting.

JAY:
And then we have a little twist, where they gotta get in the old plane!

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes.
He...

JAY:
And all the dads in the theater clapped.

MIKE:
He's like:
"We're gonna shoot..."
"We're gonna get a super modern-ass plane."
"And I'm gonna shoot up into the atmosphere and fly..."
What, ten...
Not ten knots.
Ten, uh...

JAY:
10 G's.

MIKE:
No.
10 G is, like, the weight.
The gravity.
It's, uh, Mach 10.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

MIKE:
The speed.
"And, uh, that's gonna be awesome."
"Then I'm gonna fly around in an, in an okay plane."
"But then at the end, I'm getting the old F-14 fighter pilot from the first movie."

JAY:
Mm-hmm.
And it puts him at a disadvantage.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Your hero's at a low point.

MIKE:
Yes.
And they have to, they have to dogfight, uh, in the old plane and figure it out.
And it's exciting and adventurous.
And Miles Teller saves them at the end.
All sorts of goodness.
It's adventurous.
It's exciting.
It's expertly-done.
But they were saying like:
"Tom Cruise!"
"Tom Cruise!"
"Tom Cruise saved the movie theaters!"

JAY:
Yeah.
That's, like, the crazy thing.
This is, like, the fifth highest-grossing movie of all time now.
Is it that good?
Not really.
But I think that it's done so well is just...
Shows how people are just starved for, like, real movies.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And it's a good example of, like, a theatrical experience that's worth it.

JAY:
Yeah.
It's, like, I think back to, like, I dunno...
Everybody went, everybody went nuts for The Dark Knight.
Because it's like:
"Holy shit!"
"There's so much real stuff in this movie!"

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And there's IMAX sequences.
And, it's like, yeah.
It feels like a reason to see a movie.

MIKE:
And the opposite of that is Jurassic World: Dominion.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's such a slog to sit through.

MIKE:
They really loved talking about their real rubber dinosaurs they had in there.
They had a couple.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
"We're just like Tom Cruise!"
"We got real things in our movie, too!"
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
So, uh, yeah.
That's that.
I, I don't have much else to say about that movie.
But if it's still playing in theaters, I'd go watch it in a theater.
Check it out.
Even if you have to deal with people eating nachos on your own lap.

JAY:
Does that happen to you a lot at the theater?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They oversold tickets, so this fat guy had to sit on my lap.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
The whole time.
He'd eat his nachos, and they'd spill all over my clothes.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
All the nacho cheese got in my hair.
And my eyes.
And he kept farting.

JAY:
Well, that's...

MIKE:
Right on top of me.

JAY:
That's to be expected.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I couldn't see the screen.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
It was a miserable experience.

JAY:
Yeah.
But luckily, it was for Jurassic World: Dominion, so it kind of worked out in your favor.

MIKE:
Yeah.
So, Jay.
What would you recommend?

JAY:
Top Gun: Maverick.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
That's it.

MIKE:
That's...
I, uh...
With a, with a pretty good recommendation for Thor: Love and Thunder.
Uh, definitely not Jurassic World: Dominion.
Uh, Thor: Love and Thunder is fun.
Chris Hemsworth is charming as Thor.
Uh, there's some good gags in it.
Uh, a little uneven.
So it falls in the middle range.
But it's a watchable movie.
It's fun.
You may not have liked it.

JAY:
I thought it...

MIKE:
I didn't love it, but I thought it was, uh, certainly watchable.
But Top Gun: Maverick exceeds both of them.

JAY:
Yes, yes.

MIKE:
With, uh...
Exceeds both of them by a longshot.

JAY:
Well, Mike.
We finally talked about some big summer movies instead of more indie hipster garbage.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
Some of the biggest, most successful, most popular films of 2022.

JAY;
Yeah.
And I guess now we have nothing left to watch but, uh, Miracle Valley, directed by Greg Soestero from The Room.
It's a Tubi original?

MIKE:
What's a Tubi?
"To be, or not to be?"
"That is the question."
But, before we watch Miracle Valley, directed by Greg Soestero of The Room, we've gotta take our next dose of Glimbeeza.

JAY:
Oh, thank god.

MIKE:
Because I'm fiending.
You know, no one's ever said that pain pills were addictive.
Why don't they tell people these things?
How many refills are left?
How many refills?
No refills?
Oh, shit.

JAY:
Oh.
Well, I guess we gotta make 'em last.

MIKE:
Oh.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
It's kicking in.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Kicking in.
I feel all my joints tightening up.
Uh, sweet pain-free effects of Glimbeeza.
That'll make watching Miracle Valley, directed by Greg Soestero of The Room, that much more enjoyable.
Hey, maybe it's a good film.
I haven't watched it yet.

JAY:
I mean, it's a Tubi original.
They're not gonna bankroll just anything.

MIKE:
I think Tubi is who I get my life insurance policy through.

JAY:
All right.
I'm about to hit play.

MIKE:
I see it.
I see it.
I see it.
What?
What happened?

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Did you hit something?
A button?
Did you hit some kind of wrong button?

JAY:
No.
The goddamn internet's down.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
How are we supposed to watch more movies on streaming?

MIKE:
Oh, no.

JAY:
We were just about to watch Miracle Valley, directed by Greg Soestero of The Room.

MIKE:
I was looking forward to watching this film.
Well, Jay.
Since we can't watch any movies on streaming, I think it's about time you watched Star Trek: The Next Generation with me.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
Look.
I happen to have the very first episode on VHS.
It's called Encounter at Far Point.
And it's the most boring-est thing ever.
But you gotta start at the beginning.

JAY:
Well, if we're gonna do that, we have to get the VCR fixed.
Because I think it's broken.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
Huh.
For some strange reason, the name Lightning Fast VCR Repair has popped into my head.

JAY:
Never heard of it.

MIKE:
I know.
I even think they have a location that's pretty close to us.

JAY:
Never heard of it.

MIKE:
I'll go give 'em a call.

JAY:
Never heard of it.

MIKE:
For some reason, I have their phone number memorized in my head.

JAY:
I've never heard of it.
Never heard of it.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Sounds like bullshit to me.
Oh.
How's it going?
Calling to get a VCR repaired?
Something very familiar about all of this.
