half in the bag i'm in my underwear
this book sucks want to watch a movie on streaming oh do i have to leave the house
no it's on streaming well then yes
what do we got oh let's watch whatever this is it's the first thing that showed up let's watch it quiet
i can't see your fat head's in the way quiet
well we just got done watching a movie on streaming would you like to watch another movie on streaming no sir let's
watch another movie let's see what's next watch this play
what is this quiet
i'm trying to watch a movie on streaming
wow we just got done watching the second movie on streaming would you like to watch another movie on streaming oh sir
let's do another movie we'll watch another one on the streaming
make it play you're facing the wrong direction oh my god tv's that way i thought you were the tv no
you're pulling the remote at the tv what point two at the remote at the tv what are we doing we're gonna watch another
movie on the streaming another movie the third movie jesus christ i'm gonna watch the third
movie on streaming now let's put it on
power okay got it okay play
well we just got done watching a third movie on streaming want to watch a fourth movie on streaming no let's talk
about the three movies on streaming that we watched talk about all three movies okay it'll be a
review extravaganza three movies nobody cares about one bit
we talk about movies that everybody's seeing people say why don't you talk about some smaller movies and then we talk about smaller movies and people say
i've never heard of that movie why are you talking about this it's like we can't win
wow you want to talk about these three streaming movies that nobody gives a [ __ ] about sure all right let's do it
but first i have a cold beverage you should have a cold beverage too
okay cheers cheers some movies
oh thank god this plot device makes me not have to wear this hat and glasses anymore
i suddenly feel less old let's talk about films all right let's do it i
took some steps in setting healthy boundaries and locked my dad online he's
never really been there for me when i needed him and i'm done with that did you delete your profile kind of the main
way i was staying in touch with you well we're talking about i guess we'll call this the the indie movie
extravaganza triple feature triple feature of smaller movies smaller releases
uh i guess the biggest one is probably the blumhouse one right because the blumhouse uh they got in descending order and it's
interesting i wanted to point this out to you jay okay i did a little bit of research uh of course the biggest
biggest out of the three films is the bj novak directed film vengeance
um which i believe i looked up the box office for this and we have to have a quick discussion about
this okay vengeance i think pulled in as of today
3.9 million dollars worldwide watcher then comes in the second place
with 1.9 million worldwide i love my dad the patent oswald movie worldwide gross
94 000 okay and so i'm like
wow that's not a whole lot of money no it's not and i'm like but that also doesn't include renting it
on streaming for 20 bucks a pop because these all i think were like same day right theater and
vengeance maybe got a little theatrical window it's the uh yeah and obviously it depends on the the the
width of the theatrical release i'm sure i'm sure i love my dad didn't get 3000
screens right probably a few in some art house theaters but then does this box office
revenue include streaming i don't believe it does how do you report that and uh you know i don't know but
is it making 10 times this on streaming right i don't know i'm gonna guess not but i don't know because they don't
release those numbers right and they don't release any numbers like that prey movie hulu just said it's the most
viewed movie or tv show on our service it's like what does that mean i mean i don't
i don't doubt that i guess but what does that mean they uh yeah they don't release the numbers and i guess they don't have to
but it makes it harder to gauge uh how well a movie's doing yeah
well another way to gauge its exposure because obviously like i found out about i love my dad on
twitter i think i saw a patent tweet at something okay that was the way i found out about this movie
i probably would have saw it when it appeared on streaming on whatever
amazon prime voodoo i use voodoo and people think i'm on the payroll of voodoo
it's just a really simple app okay you know you use apple yeah
i just have voodoo i'm sorry i'm [ __ ] sorry voodoo is owned by walmart which
means you're not a chill for voodoo you're a chill for walls owned by walmart yeah oh you know which makes
makes a lot of sense when you think about it you know here's here's naive old me and i go should i rent and or buy
this on amazon prime the big conglomerate or should i give some money to the little guy voodoo and here
here i am uh giving more money to walmart to walmart well my opinion has changed a bit
uh but really i don't care
i just got a different age and a different name i met someone
online she's like smart funny and you've like talked her on the phone and stuff
obviously uh i guess we'll talk about i love my dad first sure
we can go in sequential order okay uh the director james morocini
i believe is his name director writer star yes based on his real life i guess i
think so i think it's you know which money is my my critical opinion of it but we'll get into that i
guess uh yeah he seems to be mostly an actor he directed
a movie in 2018 called three
some thing three like a threesome thing okay and it's like two dudes that
want to have a threesome with the girl and then uh you know it's like it's like
an hour and 15 minutes and it looks kind of low super low budget i vow
to never leave your side no matter and if what get hard
i'll be right there by your side and i will not leave
and uh that kind of had like meddling reviews uh it had one
actual critical review i'm like so does patton did pat work with him in the past like how did he just say he might have
just been attracted to the material because it's kind of a unique story it is yeah and and you want the dad
character because the premise of the movie is uh this this young guy gets basically
catfished by his dad his dad is always coming up with excuses to not see him he's never around
so the son like defriends him on facebook and all social media so the dad creates an
alternate account as a waitress inspired by a waitress that he met right uh to catfish his own son yes and that's the
purpose of the movie right so so he can keep talking to his son so i think i think his the dad character is is
well he's unsympathetic at first and then the point of the movie is you
they have a their relationship gets stronger towards the end so i think like if you want to cast someone who kind of
looks like he could be a sleaze but is also lovable you cast patent you know and who's
he's the best thing about the movie his performance is very good right i'm not perfect you're not [ __ ] just yeah i
just said i wasn't okay you're right i'm here now if if i gotta
do every little thing for the rest of my life to make up for it i will i i don't and this is when i say things
get murky uh the character the main character who's also the writer director star based on
his real life he's suicidal he's had suicidal uh he's had suicide attempts
and if that's real then it makes it very hard to to have any
sympathy for pat oswalt because the kid's emotionally unstable and the things he's doing as far as like
catfishing and lying to his son are so awful and i don't know how accurate it is to real life and
if the movie's anything like real life then the kid you know has kind of mended his relationship with his father so that's
great but just looking at it as a movie and ignoring the real world aspects of it and how [ __ ] up that situation is
to do to someone who's emotionally damaged and suicidal it's it's really hard even though
patton's performance is good it's really hard to get on his side but if it were
just he's just a kid who's in college and his dad is catfishing him because
his dad wants to talk to him and then at the end he finds out
the normal reaction would [ __ ] off you know the fact that he did
have a prior suicide attempt adds so much weight and stakes
to patton's terrible plan i agree with that to go wrong yeah and
so you're like oh my god like and that's that's what makes it uh adds the because it's a fairly light
simple story so it almost needs big stakes other than oh our
relationship is now ruined forever but when before it was just pretty ruined
if it was like his dad like and him had great relationship and his dad was like you should start dating some girl and
then he he finds a girl and catfishes him then the stakes are that uh when he finds out it's going to ruin
their relationship but at present their relationship is bad if he finds out it would just get worse
but the fact like that scene when patton's like panicking because he's going into the diner and blah blah blah
oh yeah that gets like and you're like i don't know like what what this kid's gonna do he's and then uh patton's
ex-wife amy played by amy landecker finds out about it
you know and then it's just like everything starts unraveling good good drama how did you know that
actress's name that plays his ex-wife in the movie i had no idea who that was amy amy landecker she looked mildly familiar
these are tons of stuff okay um the reason why i know her name she's from chicago
and growing up my mom would always listen to oldies
and there is a dj named john records landecker hmm
and i always remember that name then i uh accidentally discovered one day that
she is the daughter of john records landecker okay uh so that's how i know
uh her name all right uh but yeah she plays his wife and then of course rachel dranches on the film um and we should mention that uh these
reviews will be spoiler filled sure so we're gonna say jump to the next review jump to the next review if you don't
want things spoiled yeah kind of spoiled the ending a little but um i think it's all kind of spelled out
in the trailer the the movie opens with a really great wonderful little way of introducing
patton's character as a sleaze when the younger version of our main character
finds a dog and says what if this is somebody's dog that's lost and he goes ah yeah
patent goes in and then they see a lost dog poker and he rips it off so and and
so you're like oh like it's super off-putting yeah i was expected to be a darker movie because of that right more
of like a like a bad santa kind of grimy tone or something father of the
year with uh oh uh world's greatest dad i'm sorry yeah i was thinking of that movie during
this a little bit robin uh robin williams yeah well i was like that's a great movie i also have a
suicide net yeah that's actually probably hard to watch now but this doesn't get that dark it doesn't get
dark um and it has dramatic moments but i think that's part of my problem too is it's like they build up the
and again this is based on the movie not anything with the real life actor writer director sure
if he had suicidal tendencies i'm glad he's still around we're gonna ignore the the real life yeah but in the context of
the movie they they do build that up as far as like that's the stakes like you could completely destroy your son with this
[ __ ] up lie you're telling um and then when the truth comes out
that's just kind of the end of it he just sort of forgives him it doesn't feel like uh once by the time
you get to the ending it doesn't feel like those stakes they've kind of been abandoned a bit i didn't i didn't feel any sort of
dramatic weight after it was revealed as far as what it was doing emotionally to the main character and i also was missing a
really strong because to me the movie is about the patent character it seems to
evenly focus on the son and the dad yeah and i think i would
have liked to have a little more backstory of why patton was so like selfish and self-absorbed and yeah
they have the one back story uh with the chess oh yeah there's the dog thing in the
beginning but then the chess thing which was nice that you know they show that shot of him and he's like i do this
thing and it's just like oh you're like we've all known people like that right like what do you get out of that what do
you get out of this cheating people but the crux of that is um
when patton tries to fix the situation that he's in by doing that exact same thing
which is like pretty much the centerpiece of the movie one of the most uncomfortable scenes you'll see in a movie this year yeah i didn't care about
any of that like it's like whatever i thought that was all pretty disturbing which is what they were going for and
that's fine it's just but that's the the apex of how [ __ ] up this situation was right and you have to perform phone sex
with his son he's using rachel dratch as like the middle person and yes he's yes he's copy-pasting her
like sexual talk so he didn't have to do it himself i felt like i didn't get deep into his
character patton's character where it's like why is he such a [ __ ] why is he so
why is he so full he's is that just the way he is and why is he so
really obsessed about reconnecting with the sun if he's such an [ __ ] in the past what changed right other than the
you know the impetus or whatever in the movie is that the sun finally blocks him
i took some steps in setting healthy boundaries
and uh blocked my dad online and that kind of like sets him off but
really some other moment that might have been more like internal or personal like
because little ray howard's in it um you know and he's he's the comic relief character obviously but he's only
kind of gives them the idea to yeah indirectly but um say little ray howard's like oh my son's
graduating from from high school today you know and patton goes with for some reason and he he sees the sun walk and get the
diploma and they're hugging and he sees like some kind of like sees how proud the dad is how proud the dad is and then
has like a moment where he realizes like oh i don't have that with my own son you know and then you have that and then
like a really strong they have they have that fight in the hotel room where they're just screaming and yelling but
if there was some sort of like revelation about why he's a [ __ ] his his own dad
did this to him blah blah blah like there's ways you could beef it up and it all felt very like it's an easy watch
and it was good it's yeah that's fine um but uh you don't want the the takeaway to be
that patton is smooching his son or some young dude and they're like
open mouth kissing you know what i mean like that's that's the the talk about
kind of stuff and that's what a lot of comments were like cringe i'm like well yeah it's in there and
then that was a clever way of of doing the texting thing was the real life person i'm glad
they didn't do like a lot of movies they'll just have like the text pop up on the side of the screen like yeah having when he thinks he's talking to
the waitress character who's actually his dad he is physically talking to her that was nice the performances
all around her good of course everyone loves some rachel dratch what'd you think of those pictures
which ones the ones on my [ __ ] oh i like them yeah you like them they
turned me on she's very funny in this that deadpan she's great this looks
miserable like yeah she's great open your mouth
wider wider
it's a pleasant movie that never never gets uh
a little deeper like i would have liked it too what is your motivation here what's your end goal and he doesn't
really have one yeah and then of course and then the the final like when everything comes to light it's because
he's been pushed to the point where he has no choice but to reveal everything as opposed to doing it
on his own which would have made him a more kind of i don't know sympathetic him taking the the uh the initiative to
finally tell the truth yeah just kind of keep saying oh i'll do it eventually i'll get around to it he never does
so you don't have that that character growth that yeah would have maybe made the character a little more sympathetic
the sun he's like this straight man he's yeah he's he's he's the mcguffin
the [ __ ] story he's the thing that doesn't really need to change or do
anything he's he's he's supposed to instigate change in the father character
he's the plot device yeah and the father character is what we need the we need flashbacks we need backstory we need
internalization we need him to we need a reason why why he he just stopped giving a [ __ ]
about his son and blowing him off what was he doing other than pervy stuff with uh
with rachel dretch obviously he had a divorce but um what was he doing that
was so important like just working i don't know wanted that yeah
but knowing that it's based on a true story a a fascinating story
sure sure your dad catfishes you to such an extent that
he has to have phone sex with you i i hope that stuff didn't really happen i don't know
i don't know that sounds like uh artistic liberty just for the sake of coming up with a memorable scene maybe
yeah that's that that's that movie it's on streaming you can watch it
uh watcher uh i thought it was great
uh no but that's it's a really well-made movie
uh that we've kind of seen a lot of before it's it's uh it's a good movie i liked it a lot but it is like
uh the that oh characters being stalked no one believes her it's a trope we've seen a
million times but it's really well done uh it's it's very simple kind of when
you're talking about prey it just stays so focused and it's very like that's what i liked about yeah it's very like
methodical and straightforward in a way that works as far as building the tension goes and making you
uh kind of feel like you're in the shoes of the character um make a monroe who i haven't seen in a
little while she was in it follows and the guest like back to back a couple other small things i think do
you remember she played the president's daughter in independence day too
because they had the dot there's the little girl in the original movie and even though that little girl grew up to be a working actress they didn't cast
her for independence day two they asked me i forgot about that unfortunately
for that actress i thought that that was uh millie bobby brown that's the godzilla movies oh whatever
[ __ ] uh but no she's i mean she's what kind of holds the whole movie together she's really good she's very like natural and understated
not very show-offy your typical indie actress yeah sure sure yeah and and
she's she's still not like super famous to where it's she's not a sandra bolic
yeah role of course sandra box would be too old to play that role but uh a young couple
moves to romania uh as as an american audience that's also adds a nice layer
of of uncomfortableness to it because well her kind of isolation isolation
he's working some kind of job doing something um and she has to live in this
apartment by herself um and she's in a country when she doesn't speak the language and a lot of some people speak
english but a lot of them just don't and it's not subtitled which is great yes yes and so she's just kind of like and
it's if it were took place in like los angeles or something it would have a
completely different feel well that's yeah that's uh and i a lot of people have that kind of
anxiety of like going to another country where you don't speak the language and that frustration and feeling of
loneliness and moving there and not knowing anybody yeah yeah so that that
yeah that adds a lot to it which is why it's a little more forgivable because it has that trope of like oh nobody believes her and it works better in this
movie than it does in other movies because of that it's like ah you're you're just uh
paranoid because you're in a new country with a bunch of people you know i didn't get that like i know what
you're saying but i didn't get that strong of a vibe i i felt like
it was fairly grounded realistically where it was you know the husband was like what you
know like what's going on and uh he's not comically dismissive is that
the way like a more like a bigger budget main street movie exactly exactly he's kind of like oh the
guy followed you know the grocery store we can go maybe they will show us the security cam footage and he tries he
tries a little bit they call they involve the police and the police go over there and they're like you know
what's going on and um but it had had that kind of like
i don't know at first i was like where are you getting drapes why aren't you getting grapes
dress the drapes dress the dr every every two minutes i was yelling that and then i think they get drapes
yeah eventually right well becomes more than just the guy look i mean that's creepy
image anyway just like looking out the window and someone's just staring at you but then it becomes more of like a stalker situation it kind of escalates
very slowly which i liked very slowly well that's like i said it's so simple it's a
hitchcock movie yeah yeah a little bit of uh yeah hitchcock a little bit of rowan polanski or rosemary's baby kind
of stuff she's like watching uh through the window at the goings-on and all the other apartments i'm like
like like rear window yeah no i was thinking of the birds oh of course because there are some birds landed on
the roof
attention and then the neighbor uh and then we have a little uh uh
uh in connection with vengeance we have a uh chekhov's gun
uh literal chekhov's gun paralyzation there's this playwright and don't check
off and he says that if there's a gun in act one of a play there's no guns in any one of this place i can think of cherry
orchard no uncle vania i'm not actually that familiar with this place i'm more familiar with this theory uh in this
when the neighbor woman shows her that she's got a gun in the drawer
i thought that was weird in the movie when she kept pointing at the gun and doing that i i really liked the ending it was very
like brutal and uh twisted and
not dramaticized i don't think they had music and it was just really like
blunt and horrific um there was a moment where i thought it was going to get like dark dark ending i
was like i wouldn't be surprised if they weren't that dark like i figured this would be right up your alley something like this i liked it
yeah uh especially the director's credentials well i had i looked her up but is this
her first feature yes the other thing was 21 minutes it was a short well she did uh one of the segments for the most
recent vhs movie dhs 94 okay she directed a segment in that about a giant
rat monster that lives in the sewers named ratma okay why don't we cut commercial
jesus [ __ ]
uh so i'd seen that that's the only well in 2014 she made a short for some
kind of horror festival and it's like a grind house looking ah there's a trailer and it's very grind housing i think it
looks like it's shot on film takes place in the 80s or 70s it's called um and it's about a girl in
texas who uh gets the attention of a serial stalker oh okay um it's a little
connection to this similar um you know woman in trouble by a creep
i think this is the film that i noted the sound was uh
very very raw sounding i noticed early on i think it's like their first night in the apartment
they're laying in bed having a conversation and it's raining outside and the sound design like the rain is just a little bit louder than it would
be in a more conventional movie wouldn't you have to wake up tomorrow
early wake me up before you leave okay well i think it was almost all live
audio still peanuts and sweaty strangers why
did you think i didn't like the place because you smile too much
francis was it him because they're moving around the apartment it's like rustling and creaking and
very loud noisy soundtrack yeah and it could just be a lot of foley to
give it that song i don't know it wasn't like you know creaking floor the foley that you would do it was like
that sound that shouldn't be there do you ever listen to like the scratch tracks from like tv shows oh sure where
it's like on everything that there's a lot of
stuff like that in this movie and i like that because it didn't seem as polished as like you just wipe it clean and adr
everything and then add in music and yeah a little yeah everything felt really natural it was like a classy kind
of thriller it felt old school like uh like almost like throwback yeah i think it was the
fact that i was in a foreign country and i it there wasn't cell phones and twitter and
tvs and like uh looks like noir noir s because you got the the neighbor who's
like she's like a stripper or something and she's just like let me tell you about
my stripping i have a gun well then there's scenes where uh maca
monroe's wandering around the streets at night by herself and yeah it's got kind of a noir feel to it right right
right she's investigating a mystery she's trying to solve a mystery so yeah i think uh
to me it's a winner i really enjoyed it it was nice nice film nice film
now let's move on to threat level midnight
okay i'm in west texas where this family just lost their daughter to an opiate
overdose oh my god i'm so sorry it's okay it's not something i was close to but you flew to texas for it jay
i'm gonna predict that you [ __ ] hated this movie no
i thought it was interesting i thought the story was interesting and the uh the direction it took with because it
when it started i was like oh [ __ ] this people say guys like us are afraid of commitment no we're afraid of commitment
to something we can't get out of there's no such thing as fear of commitment fear of commitment is fear of regret 100
or fear of intimacy please i'm intimate with everybody like that opening over the credits with
b.j novak and was that john mayer and they're just i was like oh [ __ ] these characters this is going to be
obnoxious and i know that's the point i was like okay intentionally obnoxious characters i don't even care if it's
intentional it's going to drive me crazy it was like a seen right out of swingers yeah only 20 years too late and
not nearly as likeable as vince vaughn instead of saying babies he was saying 100 yeah
so right off the bat i was like uh oh i'm going to be in for a bad time but then the premise gets set up he has to
go to this texas town and i was like oh obnoxious city guy and these these dumb
yokels these rednecks and then it subverts that a little bit and it's like okay this is a little more interesting i
think my biggest problem with it is that i don't think bj novak is a very good actor
and i don't think he works as the likeable [ __ ] character
he works as the [ __ ] on the office he works as ryan uh but i
speaking of swingers like obviously he's too old for the part now but like a younger vince vaughn i could see really working in this role and i don't think
bj novak really does so that was my biggest hang up with the movie because i liked a lot of it outside of that i like that it kind of
kept surprising me with the the characters and it never felt
and it comments on this it never felt like smug with the way it presents the characters and i really found that to be
a breath of fresh air from what i was expecting yes and that and and that's funny you got that from the beginning
because if you watch the trailer the movie completely subverts the trailer or vice
versa oh the trailer makes it look kind of like it's a funny kind of comedy
where this this this enlightened podcaster from brooklyn comes down to rednecky texas
and they and all the eclipse in the trailer are are the jokes
that's did that just pop out in the movie as being like that's from the trailer that's from the trailer like uh
when he does the the texas uh texas tech or texas a m or whatever university of
texas i don't know um that part he assumes everybody's gonna applaud and he's the only one because it's the
opposing college yeah right so that's like because you know bj novak
wrote for the office so he he has very smart comedic writing right
and then there's the scene with the grandma you know oh 45 is not going to not going to solve my
problem oh yeah then bj novak's like yes you're right you're right violin says no we need a shotgun a double barrel
shotgun three sidearms you know and you're like ah jokes
and then uh yeah like uh we love whataburger and it's like okay so he this guy's going to go there and it's
going to be lots of fish out of water jokes of this you know enlightened new york man who loves pbs and
podcasting and comes to this texas town and everyone's a redneck that that's what i was worried about early on yeah
these are really your daughters i mean you all could be sisters oh i think that i look this is [ __ ] old and that's
how the trailer portrays it and he i'm going to investigate the mystery his girl
not girlfriend but a girl this is the premise a girl he hooked up with a couple of times
dies of a drug overdose and the family thinks that they were more serious
and that picture at the funeral i wish it was the only picture for a
while i thought it was it's a it's it's it's there's her casket and next to the casket is a picture of
her kissing his his cheek and he's got like a drink and he's like and most of the picture is
his face at her funeral there's not even a nice picture of her and i laughed so much at that that is
just so like you could just feel those like officey kind of like moments and this is ill stupido
sorry this is how stupid though that's why you call me oh it's okay ben
he don't speak spanish but he had a bigger goal with this and and i
think one of the first scenes that was really like really good was the ashton kutcher
music producer scene right i was shocked by ashton kutcher in this movie it's the sound
that you scratch with your life
on the record of the universe uh he goes to this uh
recording studio and and then he gives these like really great like speeches he's motivating this girl to sing
and then he's like him and bj novak are having this conversation intellectual conversation i love that he knows a lot
about like art and philosophy yeah he's talking about like um you think half the people that are posting quotes from
oscar wilde have ever actually read one of his plays no her posted photos audrey hepburn have
actually seen the film that it's from no not a chance i like when he's talking about like meme culture and he's like
people that post a picture of like audrey hepburn probably never seen an audrey hepburn movie yeah and bj novak you could just
tell in his face he's like he's like shocked you know yeah and they even referenced that he's like would you expect me to be just so like some kind
of redneck you know and he's like well yeah i want something more i don't just want to be a writer i i want to be a
voice as dorky as it sounds i care about america and now i see it falling apart
and we're just standing in the corner like making fun of it you know i'd like to try to tell some story that
connects and so he legitimately seems like his character is uh wanting
to do a good job at his podcasting he doesn't have an agenda and he seems fairly like
open-minded this is about a new american reality that people can accept so instead they invent these myths and
conspiracies so they can cast themselves as heroes because the truth is too hard
to accept well that's yeah that i mean i like that it becomes about bigger than just the plot of the movie the
investigation maybe puts too fine of a point on it with ashton kutcher's kind of speech near the end yeah it's sort of
like spelling out the themes of the movies but it's still interesting because you don't see that a lot in movies where
he's talking about how like it becomes less about the specific story and more about like
the culture we live in now with what is he says like everything means everything where it's like
they don't get super political but just like you know flat earthers where it's like just people just say things and it
becomes reality everything just becomes a life of its own and then it's just that reality for people
right like the fact that it be i was not expecting the movie to get that big with its ideas based on
kind of the premise and where it starts yeah right i gotta say this is not anything like
what i expected to find i like when he's on the phone with uh her brother at the beginning he's trying to figure out
where they are you know where he's like austin that's another planet
dallas that's another that's another country right right remind me where you guys are
exactly oh you've been to texas before
uh texas it's the perfect uh setting for the
movie ironically not filmed in texas no filmed in new
mexico must have got tax breaks they're they're naive to some of the things that he's talking about but then
when they bring up the alamo oh yeah you know i thought we won the alamo you're always
talking about it it's like no no how do you take coffee in the mouth there's
lots of humor in it but i i appreciate the effort to
tell a bigger bigger story a bigger bigger ideas and not paint every character so broadly but
yeah even this is the initial setup of uh based on absolutely nothing the the dead
girl's brother is like i think i think she was killed by drug dealers and that's the setup for the whole movie
and bj novak's like what are you basing that on it's like nothing like my gut and so that idea that bj novak thinks
this whole thing is ridiculous and that it ends up getting fleshed out and becoming a much deeper story like it
surprised me in a lot of ways when it comes to all the the plotting of everything what's this podcast about a new american
reality where people invent these conspiracies you got deep state pill pushers cartels the law because the
truth is too hard to accept uh oh i looked up uh what bj novak was
up to this and this only lasted one season it was only five episodes it was it's called the premise
an anthology of now it's on hulu my name is bj novak i want to tell you
about the show i made it's like never heard of this i've never heard of this and so there's a little
video of him like he's like hi i'm bj novak this is my new show meaningful issues celebrity worship is
better explored through meaningless comedy never forget a scrotum like that haunts my dreams
that's it it's like little little short episodes of twilight zone-ish kind of like anthology
not not like a black mirror or some something like that um
and everyone is different and they're all like uh they all have some kind of political or modern day twist on like some kind of
issue but him making this vengeance movie now makes total sense based on what he did here so and what his
interests apparently are yeah like social satire essentially sure
ben manalowitz a successful writer and a regular contributor to new york magazine
the new yorker but yeah he i think he wrote for like the new yorker or new york times or something and then he
wants to get into podcasting and so he sees this as a story and then the the theme that keeps coming up is is that
it's it's not a murder mystery it's it's a story is always about a
person it's about the myths that we tell ourselves who is it about
all of us every story we tell is ultimately about a person that's what isa ray says she's like
it's about you and he's like no no i'm onto something i i unlocked her phone and i got some
new information and i realized that there's something bigger going on she's like no just end it it's about you and
then that's kind of how it ends ultimately yeah so
yeah if you're not looking for something like that you just want like something lighter
you might be disappointed which just kind of seemed like where the reviews were in the 70 percentile rating and
even the ones that were non-splats were like uh an unwieldy kind of ambitious effort
that more or less paid off you know hey i'll take a a unwieldy ambitious effort
over a generic movie any day where are you right now uh i'm in an
uber
oh boy i think we've watched just about every movie that's available on streaming
what about the batman nah let's just watch morbius again okay
oh i love this part such a great phone
such a great that's one of the classic i got all i got the whole thing memorized i can do that dance
yeah couldn't you yeah i can't dance no more
oh my god
