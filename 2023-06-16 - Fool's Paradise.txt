half in the bag
why is that tape so small because it's a beta tape Jay the new service that we
offer 10 cents per VHS rewind for those that don't have the time to rewind all their
VHS tapes I took on a client that has I don't know a hundred Star Trek original
series tapes and the [ __ ] client neglected to tell me that they're beta
can't rewind beta in a VHS rewinder it doesn't even close it's because it's not
designed for this kind of tape so what am I out a dollar sixty
how are we going to survive in this business climate Jay you do one I'll do one
we'll have it done by Christmas this business sucks hey you know how we
can make some extra money we've got that whole stack of VHS copies of the French Connection back there unedited
let's sell those on eBay for five thousand dollars each so you wanna start an underground bootleg business where we
sell movies that Disney has edited yeah why not do the table yeah yeah we're
gonna be like um video nasty in in the UK we got all those copies of uh The Little Mermaid
back there with that dick on the cover those are gonna go for a fortune now well it's a good thing everyone has
access to the new film Fool's Paradise written and directed by Charlie day I'm
going to do my own censored edit of this movie where it's 15 minutes long with the proper amount of care it's possible
that he could regain his understanding of the world it's the movie YouTube commenters are
raving about will Simmons says did this already come out
ab3 says why is this not showing at any theaters or streaming anywhere
worry wart says yeah nah and of course who can forget Los ravas so 007 who says
I try to watch this movie and it was just horrible the worstiest movie out there after that Cleopatra black wannabe
I don't know what that's in reference to this is a random one this movie that we're doing well yeah
okay so here's the story uh I saw the trailer for this a little while ago and you know I was like oh
look it's Charlie day I like Charlie Day the trailer looked funny and then it came out and it had horrible
horrible reviews what went wrong what what happened I've got to watch this out
of just morbid curiosity and to give it a fair shake to kind of take a look at
it um and just you know through a post-mortem on it would have been a lot more interesting if it was a gigantic
train wreck it would have been um it has all the the makings of that
guy cashing in a Hollywood actor cashing in all the favors from every friend he's
ever made in Hollywood they all show up all of his Horrible Bosses co-stars and Glenn Howerton is in a Greek face well
no there's ways around that you got a lot to learn kid you want the job or what yeah yeah he's got a beard I
thought it would have been funny he shows up as like uh the uh is that the agent the Edie Falco character yeah and
she has her old Entourage she's the head agent yeah but she has all these other people it's like you pay this person five percent you pay this person and
he's just there like looking at his phone or something I was like that'd be funny if that was his only part and he didn't have any lines but then he shows up later who else is in this everybody's
well I have my Lord oh okay okay I have a list and then and we'll talk about that first um but I wanted to say I loved this
movie I mean I'm not trying to be a contrarian and no I didn't love it I was fascinated
by it and intrigued and mystified and
confounded and it's either one of two things
it's either Charlie Day thinking he wrote a brilliant satire
and thinking he's the new Wes Anderson or
it's the new Freddy Got Fingered I was thinking he's making it supremely
tongue-in-cheek I I was wondering about that in terms of because yeah it's a satire on Hollywood but it's so stale
look that guy's ahead of the studio over there all his teeth are fake by the way I'll say hi later oh see her the one who
looks like a model don't look she's actually a prostitute let's do two of the salmon salad and hold the salmon
because of the Mercury no cheese or fatty nuts of any kind on there please no dressing just the lettuce runs
thoroughly with heavy and water we're gonna split them all the tropes everything you've ever heard the the greedy agents to a point where I was
like is this a satire on Hollywood's satires yes and I don't think it is almost being self-aware oh how bad it is
yeah and that that there's like you know if this were like a little graph or whatever and that's like brilliant
satire self-aware crappity that's a crappy comedy uh the needle is like
going like this constantly for me how in your face it is Art in this joints is
very rare all has story behind it the difference being though even if you were
to look at it from that lens like Freddy Got Fingered is very funny in this movie
I did not laugh once oh I left quite a bit okay is that one of those things where you weren't sure if you were
laughing with her at it because I was a stone face through most of the movie and it's not like it's not
like I said it's not a train wreck it's not unwatchable but it's just I hope you like the one joke which is that Charlie
day doesn't talk and he just does what everybody tells him to do and they all interpret their own uh meaning on it
yeah well okay here's the premise uh Charlie Day plays a mute uh not a deaf
mute but a mute who has the intellectual capacity of either a five-year-old or a
Labrador Retriever so he's just like this Blank Slate a person with him is in the
hospital where doctors giving all this Exposition yes and the exposition is given and which I thought was a setup
for a character growth at some point throughout the movie possibly caused by some severe trauma the loss of a loved
one it's hard to say the patient has lost the ability to speak because they're like this could happen if someone experiences trauma it's like oh
that's where the movie's gonna go and at some point he's going to remember oh no it's just an excuse for him to be
Charlie Chaplin for the whole movie Yes Charlie Chaplin in a Wes Anderson wannabe film with a commentary on the
Hollywood movie system um which is sale commentary stale this
seems a bit out of Step so yeah he he doesn't say a word the whole movie
um and he resembles a a [ __ ] star who looks exactly like
him who's playing uh Billy the Kid Billy the Kid yeah in a western
um and he's like he's like a method actor he's uh uh I just in case this picks up on
camera I I adjusted oh okay so and I made a
a sound like this with my thumb on the leather seat Well now you've made it so much worse well I just want to clarify
because if that particular sound made it in then the internet would be a flutter well the sound is going to make it your
explanation though um
happened again Ray Liotta
just happens coincidentally happens to run into mute Charlie Day happy-go-lucky
Charlie Chaplin selling oranges and he's like she accidentally the whole
thing is he accidentally stumbles into everything yeah yeah without getting into every detail but he's he he but
that's that's I mean that's important because that's what confused me as far as what the satire is supposed to be with his character just stumbling into
everything I guess having no agency and no particular talents but just keeps
failing upwards because everybody keeps pushing him in One Direction or another I was like what is
that saying about Hollywood or stars or I was very confused of what the the uh
the focus of the message satire was you could really make a a smart satire about
that but you'd have to put some sort of modern day Twist on it like like Army Hammer everyone hates Army Hammer
because he's a handsome white guy who's every
movie failed and then I'm surprised that even after the cannibal incidents he
isn't still a star so everyone's like even before that everyone's like Army every Army Hammer movie is like a
disaster Tom Holland's kind of in that situation now or anything that isn't Marvel related that he does yeah it's
like a giant flop you know it's there's a race component to it because he's a white guy uh he get he continues to get
more opportunities when if he wasn't like and so that that could be like some kind of edge to it there's no mention of
that in this though so I think it's more like from his his
idea of it is that you can be a total Blank Slate of a
person just kind happy you know you smile at the world you don't contribute
you don't say anything and the Hollywood System Scoops you up chews you up spits you out molds you into what they think
yeah the the fact that he doesn't say a word is super
obvious of what what the idea is well it has to it's if it's satire it has to be
satirizing something there has to be some sort of focus of the commentary
Hollywood but what about it that it's bad
oh well here's the thing everybody's vapid we get it it makes fun of method actors we get it but as far as like his
character and his his rise in Fame his characters doesn't fall in Fame his character Arc is almost non-existent
um the only thing that happens is that he there's a there's a counter character to
it a co-main character played by Ken Jeong oh yes who is also he's the
opposite I and I think this is intentional Charlie day is mute um but Ken Jong is the opposite of mute
he's constantly talking and running his game let me in it's Red Bull he's just wired
he wants to make it he wants to be successful when Charlie days just sort of stumbles into it and so at the end
they uh realize that their friends well they have a scene like an hour into the
movie Ken Jong is just this cardboard agent character cardboard cutout character but then they have a scene
where Charlie day goes to his hotel room and then they suddenly like an hour into the movie they try to give him some
Humanity yeah and it's like this suddenly like modeling emotional scene that comes out of nowhere it's like what
are we doing that yeah see and that sprinkle that in earlier and build him up as a real character that's assume
that was laughing because I was just is that like the the uh Freddy Got Fingered scene between him
and his dad yeah you ever really see
you got to see that oh that just how to whack off an elephant okay yeah except there wasn't enough if I buy it but like
the the uh Ken Jong uh what happens to him that sends them oh he has a heart attack he gets from drinking too many
energy drinks yes
um and then he gives like there's a nurse in the room and he gives this like really long speech uh you know and then
I'm like and cut to the nurse not being there right on target yeah excuse me Mr Pronto can I call you latte
latte Pronto latte you're doing great um his name is latte
pronto which is uh he got the name because uh
[ __ ] Ray Liotta was always saying latte Pronto yeah after the first take he yells it and Ken John just assumes
he's yelling his name for some reason it's so he got his name pretty flimsy it's flimsy but in that first scene when
they're on the little cart and he comes on the lot to bring Charlie Day to the
set of the Billy the Kid movie they're doing the ironically
uh one of my favorite West Anderson movies is The Darjeeling Limited which
has Adrian Brody in it and that movie is
that's his whip panties that's his most whip pantiest movie and and that's the only little segment where he attempts
any kind of Wes Anderson other than like there's a lot of the flat comedy angles
I got you share Mr pronto for you Mr pronto it's like like the like Edie Falco is
the head agent and she's 12 people behind her and they're all just kind of standing there perfect dead center framing yeah yeah it's very comedic flat
framing um there's one other power he tries to inject some style when they're at the like rooftop party and the
cameras attached to the uh the drink tray yeah yeah he's following him along which isn't I guess that's kind of Wes Anderson e but yeah it's at least an
attempted style most of the movie which isn't even really complaint but most of it's kind of flat but for what he's
going for this kind of Charlie Chaplin character like that's fine yeah but yeah the the agents scene he's uh she's like
oh I take 10 industry standard oh this is your publicist she takes 10 this is
this person they take this they take this they take this and and he's just like like you know just kind of like I'm
saying that's that's the joke of every scene is him
I'd like to tell you what I'm wearing I think his performance is good for what it is the silent thing I think he does
it well and I feel like that was probably the whole idea for the movie is yeah I want to do this silent movie type
character right in a world in the Hollywood world where you the story of
the Hollywood actor through the the trials and tribulations is you are like
a piece of meat that the studio molds and tells you what to do and it's very
like obvious they cut to I don't know whose house it was at but there's a girl walking around she's like where's my
boyfriend where's my boyfriend where did he go and then the door opens and Adrian Brody walks in and she's like oh you're
so and so and he's like hey you have a boyfriend nope let's go right in the bedroom and I start having sex okay and
it's like got it got it yeah um and no doubt all of these things
Charlie day may have encountered in his wild Hollywood adventures and this is
his way of like kind of saying some of that but but it's done in
this it's intentionally light-hearted in tone like I think he's with an R rating yeah that's what's weird is like if you
were to push that contrast between him as this happy-go-lucky simpleton and the
darker side of Hollywood like if you were to push that satire more then you
would have something but when the whole thing is has this tone of like it kind of reminded me of like early Woody Allen
too like the opening credits the font kind of reminded me of Woody Allen oh yeah yeah like sleeper like as like straight
ahead comedy movies from the 70s sleeper's great sleeper's good um so yeah I think he was kind of going
for that tone I mean all all the non-uh non-latte Pronto characters are
all other than Ken Jung they're all just awful and they're all
like out for themselves and you know that's the whole the whole premise but
I'm I'm not quite sure how to take it to me it was just fascinating if if he
were a like a supporting character in a larger movie about Hollywood and he was
just like an example of one type of like or like a montage in another movie the
whole sequence where he like meets his wife it's Kate back in sale or he meets her on the set they get married immediately they go to adopt kids like
that that feels like a short film where it's like that's the idea it's a little jab at uh Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt
yeah adopting children right so that whole sequence and then like the vapid Hollywood actress who thinks she's
changing the world yes yes the the the rise and fall of of a celebrity that has
no personality nothing to offer like as a little Hammer Army Hammer is a segment
of a larger movie like that could work but just goes on and so it felt like it was three hours long yeah or your Harvey
Weinstein's or like the really gross stuff uh that people turn the other
cheek at for a longest time because they have something to gain yes like that yeah doing like an army like if it
turned out the the the the this rising star was a cannibal and his publicist
and his agent and everyone are trying to figure out how to spin that yeah like that would be funny uh having a you know
a naive character going through all that I mean this that to me that seems like
something that's been done before where I'm from Kansas and I'm gonna go out to Hollywood and then you have to go
through this nightmare um but uh this was just different it was so like
simple and too simple it's it's confounding me it's it's it's kind of
wrecking my brain and also I didn't quite understand the appeal of
latte Pronto other like they set it up as in he's he is a doppelganger of
the other Charlie Day and so they they need him to complete this that could have been the whole movie right there we
need him to complete the movie but he doesn't talk sure so we have to figure out how to make this work and then the
joke is is that he's looking at camera all the time he's looking right into camera just keep
rolling you wanna and that becomes his magical gift of him looking at camera
and and someone's like you're breaking the fourth wall it's great you this is this is Magic everyone loves when you
look at the camera and that sort of goes away and then it becomes uh his physical
comedy and Jimmy Simpson is there who's the
Johnny Carson kind of character and he's like come on out and knock things over you know who done this
much better oh the the I Didn't Do It Kid episode of
The Simpsons do you remember that yeah where it's like Krusty's like come on out on stage
and do just stand there in the background and Bart Simpson knocks over everything on the set and the whole set
collapses and then awkward silence and he goes I didn't do it and everyone laughs yeah then they realize they got a thing
and then well that's yeah that's the thing they know what to hook into this movie there's no thing he's a blank
slate through the whole thing and I guess that's the point but it's not enough to hook a story uh well there are
there is no specific thing yeah I didn't do a thing was like they ran it into the ground
they turned it into rap song it was on t-shirts he kept showing up and then
after a while it got stale and once he had outlived his usefulness that's when they dumped him like that was like the
perfect like Hollywood satire um and nice and simple in 22 minutes
oh I I laughed when he was doing the he had the water pitcher so he tries to
pour himself some water but it's empty so he drops it but it bounces back up he looks at he drops it again and then he
picks up like a glass and drops it thinking that the same thing will happen and just shatters
oh yeah well that's like I said I think that was the the idea for the movie was to do bits like that
and they did one but yeah but there's a couple part yeah like him on the talk show so I think the idea was like I want
to play the silent movie character what kind of situation do I put him in oh I don't know the rise and fall of a of a
Hollywood celebrity so then it well then okay then I guess we're doing a satire it just it just feels like it like a a
couple different ideas that don't really work together a bunch of stuff like like if they had if his see the fact that he was a mute
potentially a deaf mute uh changed the character's perspective on
the world entirely the and usually like people like that are a little more in tuned to their physical surroundings
because they're lacking certain senses but on top of that he was just like Ultra clumsy and he didn't say anything
and that just became a sensation like do the thing where you fall down the thing where you break this say the light
because then the angle is he's being exploited and you could do all your bits and the fact that he's mute but everyone
around him is just constantly yelling it's a good reflection of like the world
we live in where it's like he said he could set up a Twitter account and just like
post like blank Twitter texts you know like you have to comment on go on a talk
show right like a political talk show he goes on Fox News we we have the latte
Pronto hey what do you think about this or not what does the cancel culture in but not Hollywood I'm not with Anderson
and they just project what they want onto yeah and then he's like looking up at the boom mic and here comes the boom
mic and he's like so it's batting out like a cat and what latte what do you have to say about this because that's
our world today it's just people on their phones people yelling like constant barrage of information
uh yelling arguing protesting flashing that uh uh
Vengeance yeah that's like uh everyone has their take and everybody has to
constantly be giving their take that's that's the much clever version of that idea in that movie everyone has to take
so you don't have a take you don't have a voice if you don't have a voice you don't exist that's what they're gonna be
famous characters not famous people uh cast
because we want to talk about Glenn Howerton well that's the other contrast to this movie is the exact same time
this came out he stars in BlackBerry uh didn't write or direct it but he's
the star of it so another It's Always Sunny cast member polar opposite critical reaction and we wanted to
briefly mention the trend this is a weird Trend yes uh before
biopics historical picks would be made about Civil War battles presidents
famous explorers uh the men landed on the moon but now
we've shifted away from from cultural Heroes to pop cultural Heroes
products product heroes yes yes uh the the creation of the Blackberry done in
dramatic fashion uh and the Air Jordan the there's the Air Jordan movie which I
watched that one who's a player for a shoe Michael Jordan
that was uh directed by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon Center yeah was it good it's it's well made I mean Ben Affleck's a
good filmmaker but it has this weird because it's like an underdog story about them creating
this shoe but at the beginning of the movie it's like oh we're only the third biggest shoe manufacturer in the country
and that's their like Underdog status it's like I don't give a [ __ ]
you created a hundred and fifty dollar shoe good job but it's well made and
it's well acted of course and it does kind of as it gets into the third act because it deals a lot with Michael Jordan's mom and she's the one that kind
of works out the deal with Nike to make the shoe and so there's some stuff about like you know money from these sales
going to Inner City kids and youth programs and stuff like that so they try and work that in but it's towards the
end but the rest of the movies I'm just like racking their brain on how they can get Michael how they can sign Michael
Jordan and make this shoe Tetris that's another one that's out the
tetris movie yes did you know I thought this was a joke because I was looking for other examples of this there's a
Cheetos movie Hot Cheetos movie Eva Longoria uh produced directed I mean
I guess that's kind of an underdog thing too or it was the concept was by like the janitor of Frito-Lay or something so
I mean they're trying to give them these angles of like you know it's a classic you know American Tale where's the
Rubik's Cube well see the tetris trailer I watched it
and it was like ah the Russian mob wants to kill you and and so if if the origins
of the product uh has a very interesting backstory or like struggle drama to it
then by all means make a movie about whatever you want but but it is it is sort of odd it seems sort of almost like
um I don't know like pandering like like to to a younger demographic
like the younger demographic is not going to want to watch a movie about the Alamo they're going to want to watch a
movie about a Rubik's Cube the invention of a smartphone the invention of of um yeah a Blackberry or the the the
Tamagotchi what's the story behind the I remember that when I was a kid when I was five I had a Tamagotchi
or Nintendo Super Mario Brothers this trend it's a recent Trend all these
movies have come out within like months of each other but it's called the Tamagotchi it's something like that it's ripe for going back to satire like to do
like the uh did you ever see uh Walk Hard yeah the John C Reilly movie making fun of the musical biopics the musician
biopics Nails Every Beat of those types of movies it's like it's not a joke
um yeah but that's what I'm saying you do a movie like that based on a product now that type of parody like it's a ripe
for it yeah did you ever watch uh it's on the History Channel I think it's called the food that built America no
they had a series called the men that built America and it was like you know JD Rockefeller but this is the food that
built America and it's just like going back and telling the stories of like how
this fast food chain started it was like the creation of um like the Whopper and it's very
dramatic like whoa whoa whoa
it's like the McDonald's guy will like they go out and they buy a Whopper and they bring it back to the office and
he taste the Whopper and then he goes it's so good
oh it's it's hilarious
I appreciate
it is it is tough when you come out and you make your first written and directed by movie like BJ Novak with uh Vengeance
pretty well received but not like
this is this is going on the Oscars yeah um and so that was like
but when your Charlie Day you've been around a while you've done a lot of Comedy a lot of movies and you come out with your first written and directed by
feature and it just gets mutilated both in in reviews and box office like the
box office the domestic opening was like four hundred thousand dollars oh and
then it was released simultaneously wasn't it to theaters and VOD yeah I don't know if you're figuring VOD
numbers or not worldwide it was like 800 so and then granted it probably played on a very very small number of screens
so it's like what does that mean I don't know how much should it cost to make yeah well and I like I like It's Always
Sunny in Philadelphia I don't watch it regularly I haven't seen in a long time but it's always been funny but it has
like a pretty die-hard like fan base like people really like that show and I'm picturing that the audience for that
show and that type of humor going to see this movie and just being like what exactly it doesn't it doesn't gel it's
not like clever wacky situations that I'll kind of wrap up yeah at the end
like that's it's a Well designed show it's always sunny and that's a show where everybody's an [ __ ] but it
really works yeah for the comedy this one it's just sort of annoying that everybody sucks like
yeah yeah it's definitely a movie where if you watch it and you're not aware
that it's trying to be satirical you're just like why is this funny yeah I got the satire part of it and I got I
laughed when things were on the nose like like the three Mexican nannies they
all look the same so yeah you got someone you stick your neck out when you do something like this and uh
you gotta appreciate it a little I mean it doesn't feel like you you watch some movies that are like written directed
starring someone and it feels like an annoying vanity project yeah this to me just felt like hey I wanna do a Charlie
Chaplin obas or to do a different type of humor than what the show had been doing for the last 15 years is right so
it's it's harmless but it also never made me laugh and except for emoticons I
emoticon that look like [ __ ] right that's all I can say I was I was
somewhat intrigued it's not a great movie it's not even a good movie
um it's a it's just a fascinating flop potential to be cult classic
um um no I think it's too blah to be like Freddy
Got Fingered like that's a movie that goes for it it doesn't go over there how do you feel about it that sticks with you that's amazing that ending
like it ended so awkwardly too oh yeah with the the gold nugget and you know he
throws it in the fish tank and then just like the credits start rolling it didn't have a good like
it wasn't edited very well um but yeah Ken Jong learns he he wants
his gold bracelet that says uh agent on it or something publicist publicist yeah
and um and then he gets an actual gold thing at the end and uh
he throws it away because friendship is more important than all the money in the world well he throws it away because he
doesn't he assumes it's not really gold oh so there's some sort of statement about something there All That Glitters Is
Gold it's not gold when are we gonna get the biopic about the creation of that song
of All-Stars somebody wants Smash Mouth uh ain't the sharpest I've
got an idea for himself sitting around in a dingy basement smoking well we got Han Zimmer on the score
I got an idea for a song the world is changing
somebody once told me somebody The World Is Gonna Roll me
and that's I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
of Los Angeles it's today to the day we release the song yes Smash Mouth
today's the day the world changes I just got the phone call Studio wants
to license the song which studio all of them all of them
we've got to get the they're gonna they're gonna play this All-Star on on
keep it or can it on on on on goofy butthole in the morning that's where
they play a song and two songs and you say keep it or can it they say keep it
things are going to change for us boys but they need the CD Down by the radio station in five minutes
do do runs up the stairs in reality they just like mailed the CD
like a week earlier and it was sitting on the desk but but in the movie has
Dash construction and then just call the movie All-Star
just in time they throw it in the CD player if the Fat Guy's sweating whatever his
name is All-Star somebody he legally changed his name to
All-Stars yeah it's a whole genre it's a thing that's happening but uh
uh uh oh so I looked on uh uh Rotten
Tomatoes for the five star reviews which may have been Bots
Sandra says funny these are user reviews not Credit reviews yeah but they're approved oh
that's right you have to be approved now to so Sandra says funny period good actors
Maja says it was a cute rom-com
it wasn't a rom-con I think they misinterpreted the relationship between Charlie Day and Ken Jong in that movie
the longest review uh it's either written by a person whose
first language is not English or an AI this is a user review yes on Rotten
Tomatoes yes I'm starting to become skeptical of AIS like they they showed the movie to an AI and it belched out
its interpretation of it okay okay the film was somewhat predictable a
parody of a mentally disabled patient who has a form of PTSD that has left him
mute and non-communicative but lost in whatever World in which he
is dwelling since he appears Indigent the hospital puts him on a bus parenthetical he has
no belongings other than his clothes and Derby hat and he is thrown off the bus in downtown
L.A what unfolds afterwards is a holly weird
series of events that make him a quote star but only for a sparkling moment
yeah that has that weird uncanny AI sound the real theme is not what you say
but who you are deep inside our hearts and senses go out to him
the publicist needs him after a medical condition lands him in a hospital latte
Pronto Charlie day is told the publicist has dies
and the wrong body is cremated by a concerned mortician but the publicist is
alive when reunited he finally realizes that he can speak and does so with love for
another human being his compassion and empathy brings him back to a world where he can finally say I love you too
a deep performance by Mr day is outstanding he has learned that not a clown smile
not a clown smile but one from deep within makes him the epitome of Charles
Chaplin's music of the great classic song Smile
it is a joyous ending for the smile is the beginning of his new life
I was fascinated and also felt deep empathy for this character as the fool
was not latte Pronto but the idiots who have attempted to relate to him and to
use him and abuse him but in a glorious moment in the sun has shown for him and
he ends up the one who can truly be a human who is smiling
this is not a film to be taken lightly it is a deep introspective into our fake
world and the fake symbols that make one important but in the end all you need to
do is quietly smile and feel released four and a half Stars wow
so the jury's out if this is an AI or someone who is an ESL type person okay I
don't know but it's certainly stinks of AI well let's let's do a comparison let's type into an AI bot okay we'll say
write a positive review of the film Fool's Paradise okay see what happens and we'll see what happens okay I'm
curious I'm curious
