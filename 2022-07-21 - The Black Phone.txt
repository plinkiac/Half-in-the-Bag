interesting you want to talk about the black phone oh sure
would you like to see a magic trick from the director of bagool
it's a new kind of monster ethan hawk he drives around in a creepy child molester
van and kidnaps children and his character in the movie is pretty evil too all joking aside you did not really mean
that about ethan hawk no no as far as i am aware there's never been any allegations of anything against ethan
hawk seems like a very nice man he's very passionate about acting yes he is and i did not know he was the
villain in this movie this is another one we were talking about uh last time how i don't watch trailers for certain
things didn't see the trailer for this i just saw a poster with that mask i think i had heard somewhere that tom
savini designed the mask which i thought was pretty cool because he doesn't really do much anymore multiple masks multiple masks yeah yeah
so this movie was a big surprise to me uh it was in theaters like a week ago and now it's on vod
yeah it came on vod rather quickly and i i knew ethan hawk was in it because his name is very prominently
positioned on the poster no i knew he was in it i didn't know he was the guy behind the mask
here's the thing with this movie is i scour i scour the
i take my scraper and i go to the bottom of the barrel and i look for anything because i like watching horror pictures
i really enjoy them but uh yeah there's uh this movie called abandoned with emma roberts would you
theorize as a boy in the walls movie i saw the trailer and yeah michael shannon's in it he shows up he's red
herring i'm sorry i didn't mean to scare you but i guess you folks aren't from around
here she said there's something creepy about this house someone died in this house or did they and then they show a
little like person run by and then she's like i hear things in the walls and i'm like oh my god
what happened to the boy he wasn't killed he lives in the house next door and it feels like a pandemic movie like
we had emma roberts her husband is played by john gallagher and then michael shannon
plays red herring who lives next door michael santa's a good actor it's a shame he's
doing this stuff now he's playing the wall movies he's like he's like well i used to live in this house but i live
from down the road and you better be careful uh so it's like three actors in a farmhouse and i'm like a pandemic movie
yeah it's uh you know a minefield of of stuff
and i saw a black phone right and it's like only in theaters i'm like oh
uh ethan hawks in it and then scott derrickson's the director uh he did doctor strange he did uh the
the ghoul movies it's the movie he he jumped off of the marvel train to make
the doctor strange two he left over creative differences
yeah we all know what that means yeah google aka sinister uh
what's the first one he did yeah what else did he do oh he got to start with one of those direct-to-video hellraiser
sequels
uh i'm i'm going now more so on what the hook and the premise is as opposed to
uh the production value i'll go with like you know oh this looks good
i i like the pedigree almost it's like yeah okay i'm not gonna totally waste my time they got some good actors in it and
of course ethan hawk has worked with him on sinister and uh so i was like all right and that popped up on vod and i'm like pretty
pretty narrow uh theatrical window there which is smart yeah you know what was on tv
on cable uh is cable still a thing yeah i've cabled
people still have cable uh there was a movie that came out i think in the 90s called searching for
bobby fisher oh yeah yeah and then i'm watching it and it's so [ __ ] boring
and i'm like did they find bobby fischer well yeah yeah it's about him
becoming the chess champion or whatever but i'm like this played in movie
theaters people went and purchased tickets to work i remember when it came out it was like searching for bobby
fischer and i and the mo the thought of that is just like mind-blowing that that
would happen today like a movie like that would play in the theaters oh yeah if you're talking about like what gets
theatrical yeah yeah and so it's like we've said it before but marvel movies disney movies a movie like that could
get made today but it would not be like it'd be like an apple tv plus exclusive yeah yeah and i was like oh my gosh and
then i was like what's in the theater jurassic world dominion
the new marvel crap thor loving thunder and horror horror
still does well horror has consistently done well for decades yes the one one reliable genre it's also like uh it's a
it's a teen thing so that you know teens have nothing to do
it keeps them away from the fentanyl and then so they're like well let's go to the theater and hang out you know and
then afterwards we'll we'll do fentanyl in the parking lot but but what do you think teens would
have thought of this film oh they would not have liked this one but uh yeah so that's a little back
story um i guess we should get into it what did you think of the black phone i
liked it a lot i was surprised when i think of because i know scott derrickson i just think of bagool
i barely remember anything about that movie other than the the creepy like eight mil meter stuff yeah and then the
endian there's a jump scare i mean oh my god so you leave the theater on a jump scare yeah so i kind of even though this
looked pretty decent i assumed it was going to go that route and then it never does before i forget did you notice the
bagool reference no um in the basement where the kid is being kidnapped
along the wall is like like a blood trail oh like the poster i think it's
supposed to be like rust yeah there's like a crack yeah but it's the very similar to the poster where bagool is
like i didn't even look at that but this is a more mature movie than bagool well it's a super
super simple movie in the best possible way yeah it's a it's a flip on um
the concept that the the villain is the one with the the paranormal
supernatural abilities well that's i kept waiting like what's his backstory what's there's more to
this what's going on why what's with the phone and it's nothing yeah it's nothing
put that on the poster it's nothing well you expect you see the creepy mask ethan ox playing and you
think he's going to be a supernatural villain and uh but it is a total uh
reversal on that concept the supernatural elements are with the victim uh the
little kid kidnapping the movie takes place in 1978 and you know that late 70s early 80s
there was that kind of the whole concept of kid kidnapping
adam walsh and that kind of all that kind of stuff was going on and and parents became more aware of it and um
whether or not uh actual kid kidnapping and murders were higher than than they were in like
the 50s 40s 30s or if it was a result of media yeah mass
media becoming more prominent watch out don't be playing the arcade game at the
sears all by yourself so they end up getting abducted in a van it's always in a van
that's always the and i was a little worried about that early on too it was like are they just doing the cliche
kidnaps kids in a van but jay a van is the most efficient way to kidnap someone sure
in terms of like a horror movie it seems almost like a cliche at this point like get abducted by the creepy guy in the van creep fan yeah but it works works
well in this movie it's not overplayed no it's just a function of the story and speaking of it being simple
uh it works for his character because we don't really learn a lot about ethan hawk's villain right um but he has like
the van says like it's like abracadabra like entertainment supplies or something so it's like maybe he was a children's
entertainer the way he talks and kind of interacts with the kid a little bit like when he's showing off his mask he's very
like theatrical yeah so it's like that might be it but the movie doesn't over explain any of it because everything
vague it could be his front or his story to lure kids in yeah like he's
he has black balloons that just adds a creepy element to it but you know he's not really good at it like he would
dress up more colorful and be like hey yeah i mean the the have you seen my lost dog
or hey i've got a bunch of candy in my van or the classics yeah um but he takes a different route and maybe he's just
really bad at it that could be too i mean he's clearly like socially awkward and uncomfortable with himself hence the masks there's a
lot wrong with them but we're never told yes because and this is this is the
important part with the movie uh we're gonna get into spoilers because this is gonna be kind of a short review sure
this is kind of an impromptu review we were just like oh hey this movie's on let's watch it all right let's talk about it and it's not like it's not mike
and jay talk about worthy i didn't like just absolutely love this movie but i really
really um respected it because of its simplicity
yes and it didn't go into like it was a horror movie but it was about bigger
things and we'll talk about that and it wasn't like conjuring where it's like
the house is going to explode now any of the larger studio movies that come out now that's what i'm i'm waiting for it
to turn into that and this never does um but if you want to hear more about the black phone and you've seen it or or want to
see it and don't care about spoilers here we go hang up the phone now
the at some point watching it i was like this feels very stephen kingish
very stephen kingish i'm like is this a short story by stephen king
sort of then i see based on a short story by joe hill
and i'm like oh it's not a short story by stephen king this is where i'm clueless because
i look up joe hill and i realize he is the son of stephen king who looks
exactly like him exactly like young stephen king with the beard and the glasses yeah yes uh
his name is joe uh hillegaard king
but his pen name is joe hill he should have called himself joe bachmann that was a little nod yeah
but uh whatever is his pen name is uh he is the son of stephen king and he has a very similar writing style yeah well i
was uh i saw his name pop up in the opening credits like based on a short story and
as the movie was going along i was thinking like i wonder if the story is just in that room for the movie they
expanded with the sister character and the cops looking for him and the worst part of the movie
the brother if we're in the spoilers the cokehead brother character he's barely in it which is good because that was
that was comical that performance that guy was in the sinister movie too which means that the grabber has to live
somewhere in this area right here that was a little uh
false flag kind of thing uh i did like the i don't know if you'd call it a subversion but the cops go and they're
immediately like oh this guy's like a conspiracy guy he's got white board and all the information about all the
missing kids and he's like coked out of his mind and he's just immediately trying to explain it all to him
and uh the idea that like right when the cops leave the camera just goes down to the basement and we're like oh it's that
house as opposed to making it like an attempt a shocking reveal later well i i
actually eagle eye mike knew immediately that that was the house oh
there is a uh one of the girl his main character's little sister
she has kind of psychic premonitions in her dreams and one of her dreams is her brother pounding on this door and it's this
weird door it's almost looks like a school door but it's on the house and has this big glass window with the
metal x's that prevent it from being broken yeah and then when the police come in
to talk to the brother very briefly they they show the door closing and you see that it's that exact
very specific type of door and i'm like he's in that house but they don't drag out the mystery of like no like a reveal
later oh my god he was underneath the guy's house the whole time he just immediately paid out the reveal is the
second house yeah but uh which i saw that coming just because the way it was like edited it felt very like uh silence
of the lambs and it turns out it's the wrong house this is gonna be the wrong house jay's referring to clarice with
the yeah yeah she's in the basement we keep cutting to the cops showing up and it turns out oh my god
those are two separate houses two separate houses they do that same thing that that uh that was that particular sequence was taught in film school yeah
i learned about in film school too where it's like cross-cutting and misleading editing and it's a classic example of
that but yeah so so there's that and then the brother eventually
figures it out and comes down the stairs and discovers the kid has been kidnapped in the basement and then he gets an axe
to the head and that was very misery uh asked with the sheriff oh yeah and so
i was like and then or uh this is the movie not the stephen king book but the movie version of the
shining yeah sky man crawlers spends the whole movie trying to get to the hotel and immediately gets an axe to the chest
it's more accurate because it involved an axe but but still that that moment when you think you're gonna be saved but
so that with that and then um the kidnapped boy is uh the premises
he's locked in a basement and this weird black phone keeps ringing and it's not even plugged into the wall and the
ghosts of previous dead children are talking to him through the phone giving him hints
how to help him escape which again is never pushed too far it's like they don't over explain it it's like he's
just hearing voices from ghosts yes that's all we need but the supernatural exists in this world they got unfinished
business boom yeah yeah and he's so young he doesn't quite he's not quite um
as disbelieving of it or yeah you know i'm on drugs he's he's young
enough to kind of like believe in it because some of the kids that are dead or his friends
the the through line of the whole movie isn't so much about
ethan hawk's character it's about a bigger thing abuse
bullying standing up for yourself good scenes uh i liked not not that i liked seeing the
kids being abused by their dad in this movie but the the bluntness of the brutality in this movie
the first half hour before anything really horror related happens is just kids in the 70s
swearing and beating the crap out of each other and it was wonderful
which is weird later on when yeah the message is more about
being assertive and uh taking control of your life but that it kind of relies on like oh yeah
you got to beat the crap out of people and that's partially the best hit well because he beats the crap out of ethanol
at the end yeah yeah and i mean i know it's about standing up for yourself but yeah that like you said
that cycle of violence we see the dad at the beginning yeah just like beating the daughter with a belt that's
a great acting in that scene that yeah yeah we do not see child abuse on camera
in movies anymore and and a little i shouldn't applaud this but but no no international just showing
something so kind of like uh real it wasn't indulgent it served the
purpose of the story yeah and that's important i think that in comparison to those recent it movies and everything
felt so like over the top as far as that stuff goes oh this is this is grounded in reality even though
there were ghosts calling people on the phone yeah that's more grounded in reality than it oh by by far yeah scott
derrickson should have directed it maybe but that's what i like about this movie is that it didn't
indulge in like the whims of the studio yeah why don't we have a scene where ethanol comes down and he turns into a
monster and then and then the house blows up and gets sucked into a vortex
into space it's got derricks and says well that doesn't make any sense for the story and they say it's a dream sequence
whatever just put it in there so we can put it in the trailer yeah but our hero kid
uh he's just a kid and he's got his little sister um
the little sister has like visions or dreams again very stephen king-like very stephen king-like and then the father is
a drunk who's who's just not having that because the mother is dead
and i think she had some kind of mental problems and uh either that or she also had
visions that they mistook for mental problems again they keep that it's vague she i think she might have
just been had some kind of mental illness and then the little girl reminds him of that so
he gets so mad he's like beating her with a belt our kid brother doesn't help
uh he's too scared then you got the bullies at school the bullies at school beat him up and then they start beating
the sister up yeah and he's too scared to do anything about it um so there's
all that and he admires his friend um who who helps him out who eventually gets kidnapped as well and so i really
like the scenes and this is these are movies that i like where the kid's strapped in the basement
and he's getting the phone calls and they're like go try to get up the window you know use rope from this to kind of
get the bars off and escape and ethan hawk is
not his backstory is not explained which is beautiful don't need it the kid doesn't know so we don't know the kid
doesn't know so we don't know and we don't need to know and he's clearly playing a game with the
kids that he locks in the basement he wants them to escape so that he can kill them yeah and he intentionally leaves
the door unlocked we see him a lot of times and this again is like a call back to the dad he's
always just like sitting in the kitchen yeah he's beating the kid right it's
at heart it's a film about family oh no and it's a film about beating the crap out of people
about child abuse yeah and and the worst form of it and overcoming it
and standing up for yourself uh there's themes
semis but where's bagool uh ethan hawks just batshit crazy uh and
he wears different masks much and the the brilliant part too is
he has different masks one has a giant grin on it one is like a mad mask one
has no mouth one has no mouth and and that sort of parallels the the
drunken father where his emotions change one one day he's really mad and drunk the other
day's happy and at the end of the film when he comes to the kids who they've escaped
the horrors of the house and he's like i'm so sorry and they're just like yeah i like that that it wasn't just
like neatly tied up it's like he's probably going to be shitty the next day to him they're like right now you're
wearing your smiling face apologetic mask yeah tomorrow it's going to be a different mask
so so many a very simple film with so many layers
um of things going on in it that your average moviegoer might just watch
it and go whoa we're cute in the basement if you're just looking for scares yeah and
and i like the fact that speaking of when the kids trying all the different ways to get out there's
i don't remember i think it's the part when he gets like in behind the fridge or the freezer to the garage or whatever and he can't get out
and they just hold on him just like crying for like i don't know 30 seconds a
minute and just taking that time to just show his reaction to the fact that he's not succeeded yeah as opposed as opposed to
just like getting to the next thing and i think in hindsight i i
i think it was justified but at the time i was like i think i would have liked this and
would have been a little more creepy if we didn't see the ghosts of the kids
we just heard their you know disembodied voices on the phone yeah i think that was just a way to keep the visuals
interesting when you're locked in a basement for most of them yeah yeah and it's that's again very stephen king like i think of like pet cemetery there's the
the the kid that got hit by a truck right that's guiding our main character yeah through the story physically seeing the dead ghosts i
think i read something too that he was kind of inspired by uh the devil's backbone guillermo del toro
movie there's lots of ghost children in that so visually probably going for something like that yeah i didn't mind
it but i i yeah i wonder why it's there yeah because there's a couple of creepy
moments like the one kid hanging upside down and when they cut back to the the 80s kid in the arcade he kind of
reminded me of that lame character from stranger things everybody loves that character mike do
you remember the part in this movie when the kid climbed on top of ethan hawk's house
and played guitar played master of puppets yeah to attract thousands of bats
and then had to awkwardly get off the top of the house to get into the door to avoid the bat as opposed to just playing
right in front of the door where he'd be fine right it had to be on top of the trailer with with panoramic shots of red
lightning in the background see mike that's because the most metal 80s album cover ever see that mike that's what's
called visual storytelling a little kid sitting in a basement [ __ ] boring boring boring even though it seems
boring themes are boring themes are so 1990.
when you walk away from a movie and and you kind of have a feeling or it
sticks with you that's good that's a good sign
i made you some breakfast what did you put in that salt and pepper
so mike would you recommend the duffer brothers no but i would recommend uh the black
phone i was pleasantly surprised i didn't watch the trailer uh kind of defies genre because it's barely a
horror movie like if you're looking for something really scary this isn't going to be it it's more just has a general
like kind of uh haunting atmosphere to it i like that it didn't overindulge and
it didn't over explain coming of age story of a young young boy in the 1970s
and uh with with a story through line of
fatherly abuse abuse in all departments and um
and yeah it is coming of age because at the end he's walking through the school you know they they mirror that in the beginning
when he's like petrified of the bullies he's walking quickly he's hiding and in the end he's walking head
held high and he plops down at the science desk and the girl's like hey finney
heard you beat the [ __ ] out of ethan hawk with a phone and you did it 20 years before russell
crowe nobody gets that joke
well that was a lot of fun talking about that motion picture with you jay yeah
yeah but i think it's finally time i make that appointment at the eye doctor oh
i've been having a real hard time reading words up close and i really want to finish this great novel
well if you'll excuse me ow
ooh my knees oh are you having a hard time getting up oh huh
oh oh my back oh
oh jay i think something might be wrong with us
what did you say you want to go see thor love and thunder i don't watch movies with love in the title or thunder too
loud you're crazy oh no oh no
i think i know what's happening to us
