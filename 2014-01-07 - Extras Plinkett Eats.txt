Half in the bag!
What would Martin Scorsese say if he walked into this, uh, VCR repair shop, right now?
He would say, oh my god, that's fucking disgusting, and he would leave.
Kill me.
Please kill me.
I don't want the surgery anymore.
Just kill me.
Oh.
There's a tingling in my left arm.
It's working, it's working!
