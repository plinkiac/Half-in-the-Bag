well here we are again
we're back in the black void i think
last time we were here was for uh
rise of skywalker it's true it must mean
that we're
here for something very special another
multi-million blockbuster
action release disaster
well the rise of skywalker was like a
butchered
mess will that be the next thing release
the i guess there is no other cut
the abrams cut yeah the theatrical cuts
the abrams cut unfortunately
the rise of skywalker was a butchered
mess
zack snyder's cut of the justice league
is an unbutchered mess
that's true that's true hello everyone
and welcome to best of the worst
we just watched the four hour long
uh the snyder cut i feel like we should
get free t-shirts or something
for watching the entire thing i survived
the snyder cut and all i got was a
stupid t-shirt
jay we we shouldn't a regular human
being
should we we we are we are bread
we are bred and and groomed for this
kind of torture
we've we've done almost 100 episodes of
best of the worst where we spend
six to eight hours non-stop watching
terrible movies
four hours yeah yeah it's not compared
to a best of the worst shoot
it felt a little longer for some reason
not to say that the film was bad but i
was gonna say i'm gonna talk about it i
was gonna say the opposite and that for
a
four-hour movie about 80 percent of this
did not feel like a slog
right which is pretty good it is
shockingly considerably
better yeah for me it is
because i just yesterday i watched the
theatrical cut
and i took copious notes on the the
plotting
and structure of the theatrical cut just
for
reference point for when we watched this
so i knew exactly what was
removed and added and all that kind of
stuff and as editors ourselves it's kind
of fun to
watch it and try and pick a part yeah
but but this compared to that
that's its own thing and i get i get why
it was cut down
and i kind of get some of the thinking
of it but then when you watch this
it's a it's an entirely different beast
and it's much better
and in its own way it's an entirely
different
tone oh yeah this movie i mean i think
a lot of the problem with the old
justice league is that
it's obvious it has a different tone
that's just kind of like
splashed on top of it oh yeah it's i
described the josh sweden scenes as like
visual duct tape where you can really
tell
uh there's we were talking about why
we're watching this version the early
scene when
uh batman goes to visit aquaman in that
little tavern
and there if you put two shots of bruce
wayne side by side you can see
the zack snyder version and the joss
whedon version because ben affleck looks
different
and of course his lines are sillier so
there's a lot of that stuff
can you at least point me to atlantis
it's incredibly
bizarre and amazing
and shocking what happened with this
movie and maybe we should start with the
behind the scenes
first because there are they re-shot
scenes to add one line and to add
jokes bad jokes bad jokes oh
perhaps i should fly to paris with a
handwritten note
will you be bruce's teammate check yes
or no
and it's it's it's totally the i i
assume
you did the research on the behind the
scenes i broke down
the theatrical version so we both had a
job i watched doom patrol
um but i assume it was this zack snyder
uh here's four hours of my movie and the
studio went oh my god how how do we sell
this this is not like a marvel movie
uh well it's it's awesome
that's also the build-up from the
reception to like batman v superman
which uh did okay box office wise but
critically people were like this is a
miserable nightmare
and so they're already in pre-production
for justice league so the studio
panicked and said start to make it
lighter toned lighter toned and at one
point it was going to be two movies
it was shrunk down to one they started
filming it
well no was it all this four hours of
material shot already or no
oh yeah no this was but it was it was
going to be an even grander story that
was going to be two justice league
movies
so so the snyder cut that we just
watched is
his original like what he shot when they
made the movie originally
okay um and then of course towards the
end of production he had to leave
because right the tragedy of you know
what happened with his family
and i think originally the idea was oh
joss whedon's just going to come in to
finish it up and they ended up
reshooting tons of stuff
uh and yeah when we watched this cut i
was thinking like i'm picturing a studio
executive
looking at this four hour behemoth and
being like
we can't release this no he was thinking
how can i turn this into marvel
well that's a part of it too but i mean
for like like this is so unwieldy and
large and
uh epic in scope whatever you want to
call it
it's not a commercially releasable film
or it wasn't a couple years ago
now thanks to the rise of streaming you
can release something like this and it's
not
as big of a deal this very much felt
like a peter jackson lord of the rings
movie it felt like a
epic sci-fi fantasy
adventure i mean you could cut it in
half
to have joss whedon come in and uh
shoot a scene that you know adds a
little cliffhanger and then
continue on with part two i think they
were worried that there wasn't enough
legs to get a part two
because of the reception of the earlier
movies if you're going to cut this into
parts though
there's not enough action in part one to
make to sell that as a separate movie
there's it doesn't have like i don't
think it might not need it
but if you're looking at this you're the
studio executive
it doesn't end in the the 40-minute long
action [ __ ]
so you can't you can't break this up
into two movies
oh
but it's to me the amount of work that
went in
to this four hour version of the film
all those
computer graphics all the shots just all
the extra
characters and scenes yeah and throwing
that all in the trash
and then to to reshoot a scene where the
flash talks about brunch
like brunch like what is brunch
you wait in line for an hour for
essentially lunch
i mean you you you redo it to introduce
the scene with
martha and lois that is much worse than
their original introductions into the
film
yeah well that's that's the most
baffling thing after now having seen
the four-hour snyder cut is it's a
pretty good movie
until it isn't at the end which we'll
get to but it's pretty good
and it is lighter than batman v superman
yeah we're well on record just saying
man of steel and batman v superman are
miserable nightmares it's more
sensible as a story than batman versus
superman
yeah and it's it's it's not lighter on
the
the over-the-top action the over-the-top
action in this forum
miserable loud nightmarish action is is
spread out
and it's and all these like character
building scenes are thrown in
to to pat out the four hours to where
that big action ending of this
felt i don't know deserved or earned
it it fell apart by then for me and i
was fine with it
it did for me a little bit but it still
sets up like everyone has something to
do at the end
the end of this is far superior than
this than the
than the theatrical i will grant you
that everything is but that's the most
shocking part is that
this wasn't as miserable as the other
zack snyder movies it does have a
lighter tone
barry allen is kind of annoying but he's
still comedic
is there comic relief he's the comic
relief but there's other like you know
bruce wayne's kind of
charming and clever in this in a way
isn't in the theatrical version
it's just in general it's a pretty good
movie that i think
if if there was a way to trim it down to
three hours it could have
easily been the theatrical version
without adding
in stupid jokes and and terrible duct
tape scenes like that first scene
uh with batman on the roof and the
theatrical cut where they're just like
oh we got to set up the mother boxes
i don't know bugs blows up and there's
cubes when he blows up
yeah on the wall with his blood how do
we trim out 20 minutes of the
of the other version how do we get that
condensed into one quick
pointless scene yeah well shall i
go right ahead refresh give the audience
a refresher
sure on the structure of the theatrical
cut
i think a lot of people watch the snyder
cut and probably haven't seen
justice league or probably won't go back
and re-watch justice league and then
watch this
so here's your refresher
it's two hours technically but really
it's an hour and fifty minutes
okay so the beginning batman lures an
alien
monster that have a demon a parademon
that have been flying around the city by
i guess being in the right place at the
right time when a a cat burglar
is is exiting the house terror demons
are attracted to fear
right so then batman shoots him with the
space gun and the parademon blows up
and uh his guts on the wall show three
mother boxes imprinted on the wall for
no reason at all
correct uh and then they have then we
have um
we have a an opening montage uh
everybody knows which feels like a very
zack snydery thing but that wasn't in
this version
it wasn't in this version no it feels
very much like the
credit sequence to um watchman watchman
yeah
uh so then after the opening credits
eight minutes in wonder woman stops a
terrorist bomb
plot which is uh contrary to
her character arc in the theatrical
version of
you have been hiding in the shadows and
not helping the world
rate itself of crime or whatever that is
not in this version
not in the snyder cut that's in the
theatrical so wonder woman showing up to
stop
bomb bomb threat uh doesn't make any
sense
superman was a beacon to the world
why aren't you
you're an inspiration diana you don't
just save people
make them see their better selves and
yet
i never heard of you until luther lured
you out
by stealing a picture of your dead
boyfriend
you shut yourself down for a century so
let's not talk about me moving on
then 11 minutes in bruce wayne just
walks up to find aquaman
because of of the bug
that he found in gotham that had the
three boxes on the wall he's a ah
there's some kind of threat
i guess the point was to make the
theatrical cut more self-contained for
people that maybe didn't see
batman v superman because that's the
movie where he has the vision
of the post-apocalyptic future which
kind of ties in with this version
yes i think that's the reason uh he uh
it's something with um
lex luthor he sees a vision of um
steppenwolf in the three boxes
yeah and then batman has a dream and so
he thinks
something's going to happen i think
there's an attack coming well i know
batman has
remembered batman has a vision of the
flash yeah that happens
he thinks it's a dream but i think the
implication is that flash was actually
coming back from
time from some point in the future but
in the snyder cut batman's
logic for assembling a team is one
to make up for the loss of superman
because he feels bad that superman died
and two lex luthor warned him about
the coming of steppenwolf and or the
threat of the mother boxes
right so that's that in this it's
because he blew up a bug on a wall
in the old one when you say this that
might be confusing in
in in the theatrical yes 15 minutes in
is when we're introduced to
the flash uh he just shows up at prison
to talk to his dad
yeah um in the in the snyder cut it's
an hour and 48 minutes which is kind of
shocking yeah
i think i'm exaggerating no no it was an
hour it was an hour in it was
like part three or something right it
was a while
18 minutes intro of cyborg uh i think
it's just
him in his apartment his dad shows up
comes in he's like i'm
i'm the monster i'm cyborg man i have
nothing to do with this movie
uh 21 minutes amazon land oh the mother
box has awoken
uh theatrical cut no reason why snyder
cut
in the opening it's superman's death
yell which sends out like
shock waves and that awakens one of the
mother boxes
uh so steppenwolf just shows up i think
of the theatrical cut it's just
the bad guys were like okay good now
that superman's dead
we can invade yes even though
there was like thousands of years before
there was a superman where they could
have
been
true um so the the amazonian mother
boxes awoken steppenwolf
knows this and shows up and they have a
very very shortened version of the
battle in the theatrical version the
snyder cut version is
much longer oh yeah you can argue
whether or not
it's necessary that it goes on for so
long but it's very very
truncated and shortened it was fine none
of the pacing of this was bothering me
for like the first half
yeah okay yeah i would agree so that
lasts for approximately six minutes
twenty at the 27 minute mark is when uh
robin wright shoots the arrow
i think she just says light the fire
right and it just kind of
cuts to diana prince working on
restoring a marble statue
at the louvre and then on the screen it
shows the little like
i don't know it's like the greek parthon
or something's on fire
i think i don't know it's an ancient
thing i don't know what they say in the
theatrical but on this one they say it's
an amazonian shrine
it's an ancient amazonian thing it's on
fire that's that means something to her
snyder cut we have approximately a
28-minute long scene where they open up
the ceremonial case they take out the
ceremonial arrow
oh
oh
29 minutes we're introduced to lois lane
and what she's up to
she is hanging out in the offices at uh
the daily bugle or what is it called
daily planet um
and she's hanging out with martha kent
this is pure joss whedon this is
a totally different scene than that's
that's in the snyder cut
uh we're introduced to pointless sexism
in the workplace
i don't know if that's commentary on
anything that's joss whedon
uh making fun of sexism because he's a
feminist you're right
hey elaine who is your source
um the activist in that university
what it's my source a male co-worker of
lois lane comes in and says
lois give me a source doll
and she's like i don't give away my
sources and then the male co-worker says
come on give me his name
come on you're not doing real stories
anymore dahl
and she goes i'll maybe i'll think about
it i'll i'll give you her name and then
the male co-worker says oh it's a her
who's a guy well i'll see if she'll take
your call
so it's a [ __ ]
i bet she's got great dams and
uh go back to the kitchen and cook me
dinner and then he leaves
and then martha ken says why don't you
go back to work lois it's been so long
since clark died and she says
i'm fine doing puff piece stories about
cat weddings
i'm i'm perfectly happy doing fluff
pieces about kitten grooming
and scene it just ends martha says the
bank
foreclosed on the house okay bye i don't
i shouldn't live there anymore it's a
big house i'm shuffling around like an
old ghost
and see she says that literally as as
crew members are like pushing her out of
the set
we're done you're done they're they
start tearing down the set
to build like a cw show
uh oh 30 minutes in cyborg is browsing
the news learns about batman for some
reason
it just cuts to him and he's like
swiping like news stories and he sees
pictures of batman oh
i don't even remember that's so that
cyborg has a reason
to know anything about anything that's
going on cyborg is the biggest casualty
of the theatrical cut he has
nothing to do in the movie uh 31 minutes
in
batman is met by diana prince
she recognizes that uh there's there's a
problem because the ancient fire has
been lit
and she shows up at the batcave then in
the
snyder cut they do an extensive
extensive backstory
a great armada appeared in the sky lame
ways to all who opposed it
the leader of the invaders was a being
called darkseid
a name cursed and feared in every
universe
darkseid was met in battle by earth's
defenders
the old gods men atlanteans
before their descent into the sea
amazons before their betrayal and
enslavement
and guardians from the stars it's really
unfortunate when you give all your
exposition to gal gadot
not to hope for an alliance to fight
apart yeah
i'm going to let sir ian mckellen read
my exposition
they're they're in a park yeah oh yeah
they're just walking by a lake or
something the snyder cut they are not in
a park
the the the joss whedon extra scenes
they wrap it up real quick and they're
just
strolling through a park and cyborg is
spying on them
yes um so wonder woman does this long
epic story
and and she concludes with such harmony
out of such horror
it was truly an age of heroes and then
batman
says something tells me we're not
getting the band back together
something tells me we're not getting the
band back together
and then uh diana prince says all we
have are left are the tribes of man
batman says i wouldn't count on the
tribes of man they act like the doomsday
clock
has a snooze button why would you
ever write dialogue like that for batman
well i wouldn't count on the tribes of
men we tend to act like the doomsday
clock has a snooze button
batman has been around for [ __ ] 80 years
and batman has had one good one-liner
okay so we have 32 minutes exposition
dump by wonder woman
uh the three mother boxes will open a
portal to hell world
something like that right a bad guy with
horns
uh uh steppenwolf three mother boxes put
them together open a
portal to hell world snyder cut a little
more complicated than that
well there's an extra layer with the
dark side character and all this like
and the runes that are on the planet
earth that
uh well that's a revelation later
anti-life equation we'll get into that
um a minute later uh bruce
recruits barry allen at his hideout
seems pretty much the same
except for the excessive dialogue about
brunch
yeah barry allen's explaining why he
doesn't like people but he's like yeah
i'll join why not you know
uh a minute later wonder woman recruits
cyborg
does barry allen do anything heroic
before the recruitment scene no in the
theatrical cut okay
that really really great scene in this
version the introduction to flash
the best scene in the movie that's a
great scene it's fantastic
and i even joked about i was like
they're not going to do this but he
should do something with the hot dogs
and he grabs a hot dog and feeds it to
the puppies because he's a good guy
it's wonderful i was not expecting that
from zack snyder
that was a super that was a superhero
cover yeah he wasn't just doing that out
of kindness it was well no
i've just been here feeding the dogs
this whole time what happened out there
it's great
it legitimately made me laugh out loud
which is not something i was expecting
from
a zack snyder film well then right after
that is when cyborg's father
miles dyson is kidnapped right and then
there's a bunch of like they say like
nine or ten people from the lab got
kidnapped and steppenwolf he snaps one
person's neck
and there's like there's extra dialogue
in the theatrical version
where people are going i have a family i
have a family because why does everybody
keep saying they have a family
and it's like that's a really funny line
why did you shoot that
i think that's an attempt to make up for
the fact because that's even though i
for the most part like the snyder cut it
still has the problem that his other
movies do
which is that zack snyder's not give a
[ __ ] about normal people
yeah he cares about the the the the
superheroes and he treats them as like
gods or or higher beings and he seems to
have like a fetish for them
and he doesn't give a [ __ ] about people
right so the
the joss whedon version was like oh you
gotta have some humanity
civilians very sad there's too many of
them
hence the introduction of the russian
family which is
horribly attacked there is a there is a
poor
russian family that live outside of a
nuclear
power plant that melted down and the
whole area is toxic and they make
some kind of comment like in the in the
theatrical that
oh that the area is dead it's a
miserable who would want to live there
oh people that are struggling and yeah
and whatever
and then you feel sympathy for this
family that you don't know at all yeah
we're introduced to them the little girl
has like a can of bug spray because she
sees the monster outside the window and
later on in the film flash saves them
and superman saves uh the entire
building apartment building yeah and the
joke is how pathetic flash is
yes even though flash saves the day
in the the snyder cut without him
everyone would be dead
yes let's let's we're talking about
theatrical cut mic right
still we're still talking about the
theatrical cut
hour two minutes the justice league
hangs out in a bat cave they talk about
the mother box kind of exposition this
is one hour
um bruce one hour six minutes bruce
discusses
with alfred why superman being back is
important i think these are
newly shot scenes because it's a
different location it's like
it's like that room with the suits of
armor on the wall oh yeah and there's
like lounge chairs oh yeah you can tell
that's a reshot scene because
ben affleck's looking a little bloated
yeah and um and they talk about the
sonic
device the game he keeps playing around
with this like sound wave thing that
affects the bug monsters that is
completely not in the snyder cut well
theatrical they also added in this whole
thing with
batman and wonder woman and tension in
the team yes he's making fun of him
he calls her an idiot for loving steve
rogers
which is right in this case yeah and
then that's that's his
he's like poking her he's like he's like
yeah you you've been doing nothing for a
hundred years
crying over your boyfriend haydn when
you should be out there being a hero
like she was in the beginning of the
movie
you needed that scene you couldn't cut
that out yeah it's so weird for all the
stuff that you're trying to cut out of a
movie to make it shorter
and joss wayne just keeps adding in new
stuff which doesn't make it
i mean they still got it down to two
hours but it's like
does this new stuff add anything
beneficial to the movie
no they try to excuse superman coming
back temporarily evil for no reason
by having the character speculate that
it might happen
even though they would have no reason to
believe yeah that might happen
yeah that's true and the zack snyder cut
it just happens
and it's nonsensical there well it's
like he doesn't remember who he is he's
disoriented
it just felt like an excuse to have a
fight it is that's the most excessive
scene in
either cut of the movie because that was
ultimately your favorite part
arthur we need to restrain him
but story-wise it's the least important
thing that happened
story-wise bringing superman back is the
least important thing to happen
the focus should be we got to stop the
steppenwolf and
both both versions it takes a side track
until we've gotta
resurrect superman now that's the most
important thing like well i i think it's
pretty well balanced in the snyder
it's balanced in the snyder cut i agree
with jay and and because
here's here's i have the two versions in
my head right
the snyder cut when superman comes back
it's it's a heroic entrance
uh the steppenwolf is about to to hit uh
cyborg with his axe
and superman blocks it and then he beats
up
steppenwolf uh in in the theatrical
version it's like oh god
superman's here now uh nobody else has
anything to do
nobody else has anything to do and he
could just kill steppenwolf
instantly but uh they're like
oh my god there's poor russian people
that need our help
superman and the flash go help them so
that you know
so that steppenwolf can continue
fighting us that's literally what
happens
and the snyder cut um they have the
whole thing where the mother box takes
over
and and uh cyborg is unable to stop it
the portal opens up and basically
superman loses
and and the flash is the one who has to
save everybody by reversing time
so really it's not like in the in the
theatrical version it's
it's superman shows up and it's like now
nobody else is in he's just gonna punch
the bad guy to death
like in this it's more balanced where
they all are a team
i agree it's that's fixed somewhat in
the
snyder car yeah and it's it's set up
better too because
uh we we laughed at the motherbox scene
in resurrecting superman
the mother box is ready you have to
charge it the moment it touches the
fluid
in the theatrical version it's like it
has to touch the amniotic fluid
at the precise moment that you zap it
with electricity they treat it like this
important thing or it's like
if they don't have the timing right they
can just do it again splashes okay throw
it back up try it again
um but in this uh the the flash is like
a second too late
but he goes so fast that he reverses
time for just a second
and does it which is setting up what he
does later in the film so
it it serves that and whether or not
superman comes back is disoriented and
mad
i'm fine with that i i i have
notoriously bad
tastes in movies sometimes
and so when superheroes fight each other
and and not
like nameless monster of the week i find
that more interesting
like when when the avengers end up like
having to fight with one another for
some reason i find it fun
it's a fun scene in this version but
it's also the least
important scene in the film of course
but then yeah at the end of this version
the snyder cut
the one who has the least amount to do
is batman
because he's just a guy so he's just
kind of shooting demons
rich meanwhile someone is getting mugged
in gotham
although he does he's useful at one
point but he saves
flash's life which is kind of important
that's the one thing he can do but
really he spends
most of that end fight just not a part
of things
which is fine because everybody else has
these superpowers that are super
important to what they're trying to
accomplish
and he's just batman
oh my god
he cut his horn off jesus [ __ ] christ
one hour 20 minutes this is our start of
our
third act which this is a more
traditional structure
this is the low point heroes aren't
getting along don't do that
we just got our asses handed to us and
steppenwolf has got the third box
steppenwolf now has all three boxes the
superman resurrection went poorly
uh there's a heart to heart with batman
and wonder woman they talk about
leadership
superman reflects on being back alive
gonna make things right
etc etc i'm the idiot who left
but i'm back now and i'm gonna make
things right
lois lane convinces superman not to be
mad
your mother got behind on the payments
she never told anyone
i don't understand
you better cover up you look terrible
you should get to the gym more often
now superman's line oh yeah they have a
touching scene at the uh the kent farm
what was it like
coming back what was a lois lane ass
superman what was it like coming back
and superman says
itchy itchy how much money did they
spend
for for joss whedon and all of those
reshoots
i want to say it was in the hundred
million ish
range okay so a hundred ish million for
for these jokes yeah i have a few others
and then
well let's let's read the 100 million
dollar jokes
okay so when when the justice league
shows up to
confront evil superman uh the flash says
in an 80-yard line
should we bow or show our bellies oh no
should we bow or sh or show our bellies
10 million aquaman to batman
you're out of your mind batman responds
i'm not the one that brought a pitchfork
oh they had to go back to that location
they had to get all those extras back
that's the most raffling 20 million okay
20 million
uh superman says to batman i knew you
didn't bring me back because you like me
well i knew you didn't bring me back
because you liked me batman awkwardly
responds
i don't not i don't
eight point seven million dollars
superman on ripping apart the boxes um
uh uh asks cyborg any blowback
cyborg says big time but i think we
could take it
superman says good because i really like
being alive
any blowback big time but i think we
could take it
good so i really like being alive now
they already had henry cavill
and cyborg back for the reshoots but
there was some cgi involved
they had to take out the mustache 5.9
million dollars
it's not over yet rich the blowback
happens
the mother boxes are ripped apart
superman lands on the ground and says
i take it back i want to die
man my toes hurt
i don't even understand the physics of
how my toes hurt
children i work with you
oh seven million these aren't jokes by
the way these are the actual lines from
the theatrical
guy we need more we need more humor
in this dark depressing post-apocalyptic
nightmare horror film
see that's the thing is especially now
seeing the snyder cut
it's not that dour it's not batman
superman
it would have been i think this would
have gone over pretty well theatrically
if you could just
shorten that run time you might have to
do a couple of reshoots to just condense
some things and connect some scenes
but the amount of [ __ ] so they spend
all that money for the joss whedon stuff
and then
that movie comes out and doesn't do
great so then they spend another
70 million for uh zack snyder to finish
this version
which was the original version to begin
with it's just like mind-boggling the
waste of money
i kind of suspect they they added some
[ __ ] into the
the snyder version that they just spent
an extra 70 million dollars on
just just to tease some more like would
you like some more of this
well from what i what i understand to
finish this version
zack snyder did not he didn't get paid
he wanted creative control to finish
this the way he wanted to
okay and so i guess we'll talk about
spoilers here we'll talk about the end
of the movie which is
completely tacked on they shot it a few
months ago ben affleck looks completely
different than he does in the rest of
the movie
so they so the the last like 10 15
minutes of this movie feels like
self-indulgent
excessive pointless tiresome
uh uh zack snyder like wankery more
adjectives
i'm trying to do it justice
trying to do a justice league because
yeah the last it it's a complete wet
fart of an ending and it really deflates
a lot of goodwill that the movie is
built up yeah yeah
anything post like there's that there's
a heroic shot where they're all standing
on top of the
cut to credits yeah right there and yeah
there's this it's a bizarre
futuristic dream sequence where batman
is in a post-apocalyptic world with
death stroke
amber turd yeah uh
the the flash who has it looks like he's
like an iron different actor it's like a
different actor or a very brief cgi face
of the barry allen
actor whatever his name is uh ezra
miller yeah
and um and then they keep saying she's
dead are they talking about wonder woman
i don't know they're talking about lois
lois oh okay oh lois is the key though
because superman
shows up at the end of that to kill
everybody he's mad and then there's
spaceships and then so it's like
it's and then of course jared leto's
joker the joker's there as a prisoner
he has information they need it's all so
completely disconnected from the rest of
the movie so clearly tacked on like if
it was a
post-credit scene whatever fine
but actually putting it as the ending of
this movie just leaves you like i think
we all just had like baffled looks on
her faces for that entire ending
maybe in a way that smelly old flounder
is right
because how many can die in your arms
before you grow numb to death
there's like three post-credit scenes
there's the original one uh
deathstroke and uh lex luthor on the
yacht
and there's the batman dream sequence
and then there's
2021 ben affleck or whatever 2020 ben
affleck
in his glass house wake up cancer
he visibly looks five to six years older
yeah
and he looks very tired he looks like he
just got broken up with
and then dropped his dunkin donuts
leave the man alone he has trouble
picking up his
dunkin donuts order we all have bad days
um he looks like he doesn't want to be
there he looks tired he doesn't want to
be the batman anymore and now it's
robert pattinson's job yeah
man hunter a character named martian
manhunter shows up can i help you
uh which rich recognized but it
completely
confused you too yeah well yeah he shows
up earlier
the second time he shows up the first
time he shows up
is really confusing it's after a
very nice scene between mach hence and
lois lane and it's the snyder cuts
version of that awful daily planet scene
but it's actually like dramatic it's
pretty good and
amy adams is is a great actor and she
does good
you kind of forget that superman sucks
and man of steel
you're like oh she likes superman
basically martha kent
shows up to the lowest lanes apartment
they have this whole scene then
martha kent walks out of lois lane's
apartment
and turns into the martian man hunter it
was so
weird
oh my god what's that what what oh
is she a proto-demon or whatever
uh martian manhunter is that who that is
what does this mean rich what's
happening
i am very confused and it just kind of
ruined that whole wonderful scene that
those two characters just had
yeah i mean the emotions of lois lane
are still legitimate
yeah it's weird to have martha kent
turned into a martian man hunter man
chop his dick off
well that's the the the i don't know
third plot the bigger biggest
plot is that dark side
and he wanted he goes around with the
mother boxes
conquering planets turning them into his
own planet
a copy of but his ultimate goal is to
find the equation the anti-life equation
which is basically like a rune
magical runes it's it's it's a mcguffin
that will
i guess destroy all lives so he can
recreate the universe in his own image
something big and apocalyptic and bad
but but uh
darks uh steppenwolf is told by the
mother boxes that the rune
is on earth and then martian manhunter
knows this somehow and he wants to get
involved and says the real fight is
coming
next i'm sure you know darkseid is not
finished with earth
the anti-life equation is here somewhere
we have to find it before he does but
watch out for lex luthor
he's he's splatting the diamond heist
get jesse eisenberg out of the film like
you can't go back after
after uh apocalypse endings yeah you
start with that
for [ __ ] sake yeah well i mean that's
i mean we've talked about this plenty of
times but that was the problem with this
dc cinematic universe to begin with is
that they rushed into too much of this
[ __ ]
they didn't have a movie to establish
each character but when you see this
version the snyder cut even though it's
technically one movie
it does a good job of spending time on
all these characters that
we know now because we've seen the
theatrical cut of justice league but if
you look at this
if you look at this as its own thing
everybody gets plenty to do
you understand all their motivations you
like them
uh cyborg is pretty good in this he's
nothing in the theatrical cut
i guess the real question is what what
what
what do you get out of this what what
what are we getting out of this
uh well zack snyder fans are getting
their wet dream out of this because i'll
say that if you've
been one of those people that have been
like hashtag released the snyder cut for
years
oh yeah one you're a little too
aggressive about it but you got what you
wanted and i can't imagine them not
liking this
they're gonna be super [ __ ] smug
about it
that's true i'm sure they're all good
see you i told you see i told you oh
yeah it's like well yeah that's better
but
i'm still i'm still it's still not my
favorite thing
yeah but that's the same thing with me
it's like i
i can see and i find the behind the
scenes stuff much more fascinating i
watch this and i'm like oh my god
there's like you're just picturing
the decision making and all the work
gone into the graphics and then just
someone going oh
that we just threw that out yeah you
worked on that for six months that one
shot of of
the this guy and all the armor on the
bad guy and now they changed his look
it's just all the [ __ ] work that was
just thrown in the trash and changed
around
and and it's just like ah it it boggles
the mind and the amount of money spent
the the time wasted all these like like
spineless studio executives going like
a movie that was fine to begin with i
enjoyed this
snyder cut way more because it took its
time
and and the first version it's like i
don't
why why should i care about this guy
with horns
they got to stop the guy because he
wants to take over the earth yeah and
then
that it's just like i don't care and
then if you don't care
about your heroes or you don't like them
and they're rushed
then their goal of stopping a guy with
horns from opening a
portal is pointless but this fleshed out
the heroes more
and and the bad guy he had more scenes
too
that's not oh yeah i think so yeah he he
not just more scenes but yeah he had
more
motivation he had an interesting kid a
napoleonic company yeah exactly he was
trying to
to please his boss basically there was
something there was something
there was something there it's he's not
thanos no he's not as interesting as
thanos
but there's something there and i think
that's for me
i i liked a lot all the parts worked
better
than it did as a whole like there's lots
of
really wonderful scenes we talked about
that flash scene which was great that
was the best seat of the movie
uh it reminded me of like the earlier
zack snyder stuff where he had like
in like watchmen or something with these
really visual sequences
and i don't remember a lot of that from
man of steel or batman v superman
it just felt like a bunch of like noise
it's just so much a bunch of nonsense
that last hour of
man of steel is just a [ __ ] nightmare
right and that's what that's what has
given zack snyder a bad
vibe yeah for us oh yeah i haven't liked
any of his movies uh
well the dc movies until this one he's
done other good movies but
wonder woman sequences this is like one
of the best action scenes he's ever done
the the bomb oh yeah the expanded bomb
sequence
uh until the excessive collateral damage
at the end of this
except for that finale which is very
zack snyder
that's a lot of collateral damage to
stop one guy
couldn't she just punch him like she
punched the other guys
i mean she's faster than bullets
just pushed him out the window yeah just
block him on the head oh apparently
he killed him just break his arms
you gotta blow out the entire front of
the building
look at that look at that priceless
piece of architecture
she did more damage than the bomb
but yeah i mean but yeah so all these
wonderful scenes and good characters
and they all given time to develop but
at the end of the day the plot isn't
that different from the theatrical
and it's just big monster man wants to
get things
to destroy earth but but the progression
of the events at the end
made more sense oh yeah it did it didn't
seem as like confusing and like why is
this happening like
when superman returns and the the mother
boxes and
and the flash doing his circle of energy
and all those like working components
it didn't seem like as just chaotic and
pointless as it did in the theatrical
version
it still uh it gets pretty excessive at
the end it turns into noisy
punch fest but it was a four hour long
movie
i'm okay with an excessive noisy punch
vest at the end because
it has lots of slower moments that it
does
it does build us to that reward of
action at the end
i think yeah i liked a lot of scenes and
character stuff i just didn't give a
[ __ ] about the overall plot
and that's the biggest weakness of the
movie and while he's better
in this version i still don't like
steppenwolf that much
as a villain exactly my thoughts too is
he's not an interesting villain
um that's why i like the part where they
fight superman
that should have been the whole movie
well that was a story line in the comics
right
wasn't there bad superman for a while i
didn't know they definitely did that one
of the cartoons yes
but like else alternate universes
they've done [ __ ] i guess anything you
can think of they've probably done at
some point
they've had over 50 ape characters
fluent in sign language gorilla sign
language can we take a moment to talk
about the dc ape characters
rich can you name them all go oh god i
can name a few of them though
um guerrilla grad the the ultra human
knight
um titano who's a kryptonite who's a
gorilla with a kryptonite vision he
shoots kryptonite rays out of his eyes
there's gleek from the super friends
and there is a detective chimp
who is a hyper intelligent immortal
chimp that drank from the fountain of
life
and he can communicate with any animal
and he has a detective business
oh and then superman has people the
super monkey
beepo is just the perfect name for a
superhero monkey
an interesting note though in the cyborg
flashbacks when he's playing football
for oh yeah gotham city community
college or something whatever it is
he's playing against the the badgers the
wisconsin
logo on their helmet go badgers and i
was like oh hey
this isn't that the badgers and and i
looked it up and
zack snyder hails from green bay
wisconsin
had no idea the home of the green bay
packers
zack snyder originally said that he
wanted gotham
to instead of shooting in chicago he
wanted to shoot it in green bay
but then they realized that green bay
was just lambeau field and
about 150 bars
there's not even any houses everybody
just lives in the bars it
just doesn't look like gotham zach but
uh to
to maybe help quell some confusion let's
talk about
uh the aspect ratio oh yeah because
you can explain this jay it says at the
beginning it's like this is in four by
three to
maintain the director's vision even
though i don't think when he shot the
movie originally it was meant to be in
this aspect ratio
at some point again like the ending
where it's just like
excessive uh director uh self-indulgence
he just decided to make it four by three
apparently because that's the full scope
of an imax aspect ratio an imac screen
a 70 millimeter imax film
frame is in four by three well the the
screen for an imax whatever i don't know
but i've
i've seen an imax movie and it's in
scope
yeah i know the like christopher nolan
imac sequences
yeah are are equivalent to a tv 16x9
right so if you watch like dark knight
it goes back and forth in aspect ratios
yes right so i i don't
know a lot about imax as far as like
what the maximum
screen size is but it's apparently this
so did he a movie that was made to be
primarily shown
on televisions he decided to make it 4x3
imax aspect ratio
release the 16x9 cut
i don't want to see those black bars
well it will be confusing for a lot of
people because
they expect their big widescreen tvs to
be full with
justice league goodness and it looks
like on the family there are still
people that don't understand the the
different aspect ratios and letterbox
and pillar box but
but but why did they cut part of the
movie off well yeah
exactly still a thing you know and it's
so okay so did he shoot the whole movie
in imax
with imax film i don't think so okay so
but but so then like the parts that he
shot
presumably in scope format or or um
uh anamorphic he cropped then to
fit the ratio of what was his
his uh uh imax frame i couldn't tell you
because i noticed some of the shots
excessive headroom
extra headroom and so i'm visualizing it
in my head
yeah where if it was reframed and you
know of course imax you have a lot of
image
uh information to reframe it yeah even
up
as 4k or you know theatrical
presentation you can
reframe it and not lose quality right
um so i'm picturing some of the shots
and i'm seeing like
a little extra space above superman's
head and looks like reframing it in your
mind
i'm reframing in my mind and i'm trying
to go back and of course right now
we're going to show shots from the
theatrical cut
blu-ray and the snyder cut um and and
compare and contrast and see what was
reframed and how much
if there's information on the sides that
just that's just another
like thing to throw in this [ __ ]
bucket of confusion
is the format yeah apparently he wanted
to be in black and white
too now that's that is pretentious
because he's
over the top yeah yeah it's zack cider
zeck snyder's salinas
but if but while you're uh doing side by
sides of the theatrical for this version
you have to point out the color grading
too
which is i think when when joss whedon
came in in the editing bay they just had
a giant button
a giant knob that said saturation and he
just went
yeah it almost looks like like the raw
camera image
with without any like color correction
or oh for this version yeah yeah he just
likes that desaturated it just looks
flat
like nothing pops um i think i could
probably speak for all of us
we liked the four hour version better
than the theatrical cut
uh we thought it was good i would even
break it down further i would say i kind
of loved the first half
okay and the second half was like okay
yeah i i think so and then um i think
we're all
in agreement that anything past the
official end of the movie
is dog [ __ ] yeah and and you should
not watch that i don't know though at
the hero shot
where they're all lined up the line
between movie and tv show has just been
blurred a little bit further i think
with this because they weren't smart
enough to say part
one yeah part two part six and that's
what that's why this is a
like a movie that can couldn't have
existed a few years ago when the actual
justice league
theatrical movie came out because now
you have the rise of all these streaming
services
and that's a big part the whole reason
that this was finally made that and i
think the pandemic
which i don't know if people talk about
that but it's like last year when all
production shuts down and all the
studios are panicking about what to do
and they're like oh we've got this
almost completely finished movie
on a shelf just taking up hard drive
space i guess we could finish this now
and have content for our streaming
service and yeah it's beneficial to
everyone
especially zack snyder who i'm sure i
don't i
from what i read he never saw the
theatrical cut he did
christopher nolan and his wife uh
deborah snyder
they watched it and they told him you
could never see this
oh wow and so he never saw it huh
interesting
so this is sort of vindication for him
because he got a raw deal from the
studio regardless of how you feel about
him as a director or his movies like he
got pretty [ __ ] over
right uh the studio really took
advantage of the tragedy that happened
in his life to
to [ __ ] with the entire movie is that
what like precipitated it
yeah like that he just said i'm out
originally well he walked away from it
because he was dealing with this
and yeah he already knew joss whedon was
going to be kind of finishing it but
i think once he walked away they they
were like okay let's retool this whole
thing
and just completely [ __ ] it up you
feel bad for somebody like when a studio
takes takes something like where they
have a big vision
yeah and just like cuts it up and
shits all over it it's happened in the
past but you usually don't ever see
the original result of it right the
closest i can think of is like the uh
the exorcist the prequel where uh paul
schrader made his version
and then the studio said this is too
boring so they re-shot like 90
of it with reddy harlan is the director
and that's the version that got released
and then a year later they put out the
paul schrader version or the thing
the the remake the read the the prequel
yeah they redid all the visual effects
and that's never been
seen the the original version of that
was all the practical effects
wasn't there something with the josh
trank fantastic four where that was like
a big
cut up that was yeah there's a bunch of
reshoots you can see bad
samurai cop wigs in parts of the movie
yeah but that's another one like
i don't know are we ever going to see
his original version of that
solo oh yeah that's a big one
that's what i want to see i'd be curious
that that yeah that i think that was a
trending thing released the solo cut
lord miller yeah yeah the original one
so
but did they shoot an original film and
then ron howard came in or did i think
they fired them
yeah they fired him during production
but they had shot for like
five six weeks something like that it
was it wasn't a whole movie but it was a
lot
right right so there's that would be
something
interesting to see because they were
making it too goofy
i guess they were yeah you you hired the
guys that did
the lego movie and the 21 jump street
movies and then you're surprised they
made a comedy
i don't know yeah yeah uh uh
clueless studio execs is usually the
problem
because everyone's everyone's now like i
saw joss whedon was trending on twitter
where people were like
uh he should be ashamed of what he did
to the theatrical
cut and it's like it was the studio's
decision
he came in and he did what he was
supposed to which is add more jokes and
shorten it
so i i mean his jokes were terrible he
got he could be blamed for that
yeah i mean the the the theatrical
version
is condensed and it is structured
and it is a movie you know what i mean
it's it's it's bad it didn't seem as bad
until seeing the snyder cut and
comparing it yeah and then you're like
why would they cut this
why would they take this out why would
they add this
yeah it's just it's it gives you a
headache and it's very hard to process
all of this right now
there's so much to think about after
watching that four hour
cut does this spark is the is the zack
snyder dc universe no longer dead
has it just come back from the grave it
all comes down to money
if this makes a shitload of money for
hbo max then maybe there's a future for
this stuff
but this might just be a a
curiosity and then this will be it who
knows
i i enjoyed the film as long as it was i
would have preferred to watch it in
chunks
it is set up so you can watch it in
chunks that's that's magic there rich
i love seeing that part four come up we
took our snack breaks
we had to stop we had to take our heart
medicine
walk walk the gout out of our knees oh
oh i got a stretch did my taxes
did his taxes yeah came back start up
part five
yeah it is great breaking it up like
that so that's that's what i'd say so if
you're gonna watch it break it up
break it out and why not unless you have
a really comfy couch
and a really big bladder
it's streaming you can watch this on the
toilet you bring the tablet with you
into the bathroom
oh yeah you're right rich isn't the
future amazing
yeah you can watch it on the bus
with your earbuds
you know get that true imax experience
watch it on your giant tablet in four by
three while riding the bus my film was
meant to be seen on a seven-inch screen
that's why i shot it on a format that
handles 8k
worth of information
what has happened to the world zack
snyder and david lynch are commiserating
right now about people watching
their movies on their phone on the bus
those [ __ ] now if you're playing
the movie on a telephone
you will never in a trillion
years experience the film
you'll think you have experienced it
but you'll be cheated it's just
such a sadness that you think you've
seen a film
on your [ __ ] telephone
get real i'm sorry you got such a raw
deal zack
thanks for watching
