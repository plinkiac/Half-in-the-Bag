PLINKETT:
Half in the bag!

IAN MALCOLM:
Unforeseen consequences occur.

JAY:
Well, now we're all caught up with all the big summer blockbuster movies that we didn't see in theaters.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.

JAY:
And I definitely don't feel like it was a waste of 10 hours of our lives.

MIKE:
Was that sarcasm?

JAY:
I can't wait to watch the extended cut of Jurassic World: Dominion.
If there's one thing I want it's more of that.

MIKE:
Anyhoo.

JAY:
We watched, we watched "real movies".
We watched the big ones.

MIKE:
We watched three big summer blockbusters, when the blockbuster is almost as extinct as dinosaurs themselves.
Uh, and it's interesting because the three blockbuster films we chose to discuss, uh, go from, uh...
Well, it's the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Um, go from great to okay to terrible.
Almost, uh, perfectly line up.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And our opinions might differ a little, Jay.
But uh that's where, where I'm starting this discussion out as.

JAY:
Okay.
Are we starting with the good or the ugly?

MIKE:
I guess we'll start with the ugly.
I don't know if anyone even cares to hear about our opinions on Jurassic World: Dominion.
So we'll get that one out of the way.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Right out of the gate real fast.
"The Asylum presents Fantasy Dinosaur Force from Colin 'Never Smile' Trevorrow, the director of The Book of Henry."
"He's back with another Jurassic World film."
"This time, Owen Thunderguns and his subjugated lady friend must find their daughter, Eleven, who they hide in a cabin in the woods because she's a human clone who was reproduced asexually in a lab by her mother who died of clone cancer."
"However Owen and subjugated lady friend can't just sit still in that cabin and get real jobs."
"They've got to go on dino-saving adventures to show that they care about dinos."
"Oh."
"And dinosaurs are all over the planet."
"But people still go out living their lives, going to drive-in movie theaters and walking around in the park where dinos can eat them."
"Did I mention that?"
"The fact that dinos are all over the planet brings out the best and the worst in people."
"However, old friends Dr. Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant, and Dr. Jeff Goldblum are on a separate mission to find out why Hank Scorpio and the Globex Corporation have created giant locusts that terrorize children."
Would you like to hear the IMDb description real quick?

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
"Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, Biosyn operatives attempt to track down Maisie Lockwood, while Dr. Ellie Sattler investigates a genetically engineered swarm of giant insects."
Uh, not a once-a mention of a dinosaur in the IMDb description.

JAY:
Well, that's pretty appropriate.
Because this isn't a movie about dinosaurs.
It's a movie about locusts.
Finally, at the end of the second movie in a franchise called Jurassic World, they establish that the dinosaurs are loose now.
That stupid clone girl let 'em loose because they're real, like her.

MAISIE LOCKWOOD:
I had to.
They're alive.
Like me.

MIKE:
Oh, that's right.
That's how that one ended.

JAY:
That was the line.
It was the dumbest ending to one of the dumbest movies that's ever been made.
Uh, and so I'm like:
"Finally, now the next movie, we're finally gonna get fucking dinosaurs rampaging cities and causing havoc all over the world."
And we get, like, uh, like, uh, like, an Instagram, uh, news update at the very beginning.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
There's, like, there's some dinosaurs here.
Anyway, locusts.

MIKE:
There was one scene where a T-Rex rampaged through, uh, a drive-in movie theater.

JAY:
Which isn't in the theatrical cut.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
We watched, uh...

MIKE:
No shit!

JAY:
Yeah.
You watched the extended cut on Peacock.
You watched the theatrical cut, which has even less dinosaurs.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
There have never been more dinosaurs than there are in Dominion in a movie.

MIKE:
No kidding.

JAY:
That whole opening of the extended cut where we see 65 million years ago...
There's dinosaurs fighting.
We see the mosquito land.
And, and then that goes into the, uh, the drive-in movie theater scene.
None of that's in the theatrical cut.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
You see dinosaurs in snow.
You see dinosaurs in cities.

MIKE:
How does it open?

JAY:
It, it opens with the, uh, Instagram story or whatever it is.
NowThis.
It opens with that.
Actually, no.
I think there's, very briefly, there's the bit where the...
They're trying to lure the dinosaur out of the water, and it bites onto the cage.
I think it shows that, and then it goes to the new story.
But, yeah.
That whole opening, which is one of the very few moments of dinosaurs actually wreaking havoc somewhere in public.
It's just gone.

MIKE:
Wow, that's surprising.

JAY:
Look, you don't have time to put dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie.

BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD:
There have never been more dinosaurs than there are in Dominion in a movie.
Like, maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie.

MIKE:
It was like two movies in one.
Like, the, the Owen Thunderguns and, uh, Bryce Dallas Howard stuff.
And then, uh, and their pilot friend, Kayla.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Um...

JAY:
Han Solo?

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Kayla Watts is Han Solo.
Yeah.

MIKE:
We'll talk about that in one second.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Uh, and, and Maisie Lockwood.
The clone.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Um, the, the...
There's some biblical elements in this film.
I want to get really intellectual here.

JAY:
Well, Colin Trevorrow, he's a smart man.

MIKE:
He's a smart...

JAY:
He writes very smart scripts.

MIKE:
The, the Virgin birth.
Uh, uh, she, she is, she is like, like, a messiah because she contains the...
She contains genes that could possibly save the world because she's, she's the new Jesus.
And, um...

JAY:
I think that's the frustrating thing about Colin Trevorrow, is he does have ideas.
Like, that first Jurassic World movie.
There's a whole meta thing about the original Jurassic Park was great.
And it's like:
"Okay."
"You're trying for something."
"But the rest of everything that's happening is dumb as shit."

MIKE:
There, there are some, like, possibly kernels of good ideas in this.
Like, you know, who, who shows their true colors as being good, good human beings and bad human beings.
Which is like real life, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There would be people trying to make money off it.
And Owen Thunderguns runs into some in the beginning.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Like, he's saving a diplotosaurus, or whatever fucking thing, and, and he's like:
"How much does ground up dinosaur bones go for on the black market?"
"$500,000?"
"$1,000,000?"
"$500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000?"
And so as he lets them go...

JAY:
I'm smiling because that's also not in the theatrical cut.

MIKE:
Really?

JAY:
That whole sequence.
You see him round up the dinosaur, and then it cuts to him back on the, uh, back at the cabin.

MIKE:
No shit?

JAY:
Another part that's actually kind of interesting.

MIKE:
Yeah!

JAY:
An idea of, like, yeah, these dinosaur poachers...

MIKE:
Right.
Well...

JAY:
It's all gone!
I mean, they come up later in the movie.

MIKE:
I wonder why they cut it out.
Because he...
There's, like, Owen has a couple of, like, park ranger guys with him.
Like, two, I think.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then the bad guy, like, bad cowboy guys, have like six or seven guys on horses.
And they all have shotguns.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And the two, the two, like, wildlife guys are, have, like, just simple pistols.
And so, like, Owen has to, like, he's like:
"I don't want to get in a shootout with these guys."
"We're gonna get fucking slaughtered."
So he lets the dinosaur go.
He lets them have the dinosaur.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And it's kind of sad.
They take the dinosaur and they, they cart it off.
And it just kind of goes along with them.
And you know it's going to get killed and stripped of all of its meats.

JAY:
Or used in a cockfight, as we see later in the movie.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Dinosaur fights.

MIKE:
Underground cockfighting.
Um...

JAY:
Which is a part of the maybe 15-20 minute stretch of the movie that I kind of enjoyed.

MIKE:
Yeah.
When they go to Malta?

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it turns into a Mission Impossible movie.

MIKE:
It turns into a...

JAY:
With dinosaurs.

MIKE:
Then you got the Biosyn guy.
The, uh, Steve Jobs, uh, Bill Gates kind of...
He's like the most apathetic, lame, boring villain ever.

JAY:
Well, did you even catch who that was?

NEDRY:
Dodgson!
Dodgson!
We've got Dodgson here!

JAY:
It's a returning character.

MIKE:
What?

JAY:
Remember Dodgson from the beginning of the first Jurassic Park?
He meets Wayne Knight and gives Wayne Knight the Barbasol.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's that character.
They inexplicably decided to bring him back.
He has such a tiny part in that first movie.
He has nothing to do with anything, other than giving him the Barbasol.

MIKE:
But not that actor.

JAY:
Not that actor.
Which is like, if you can't get the actor, then why do it at all?

MIKE:
Well, you know what happened with the actor?

JAY:
Oh!
That's right.
He was like a, he's...

MIKE:
[EXPLICIT]

JAY:
He's, uh, he's one of those those, uh, [EXPLICIT] that I've heard so much about in Hollywood.
There's no reason for that character to be that character from the first movie.

MIKE:
Oh, gosh...

JAY:
Now he's basically Tim Cook from Apple.
Their whole facility...
It's, it's like this round building that looks just like the Apple, uh, headquarters.
If you ever watch any of their, like...

MIKE:
Sure.
They're making some kind of commentary on, like, big tech geneticists that either want to profit from pharmaceutical research, or...

VOICEOVER:
CEO Lewis Dodgson has created a sanctuary in Italy Dolomite Mountains, where he hopes to study the dinosaur's ancient immune systems for unique pharmaceutical properties.
Their sophisticated scientific laboratory, uh, which I'm sure they use a lot of computers, uh, did have beakers filled with colored fluid for the little dinosaur  -- the baby of Blue, the raptor -- to jump around and smash.

JAY:
Well, it's a science lab.

MIKE:
You gotta have a beaker...

JAY:
You gotta have beakers.

MIKE:
With blue, green, red fluids in beakers on tables just open.
No tops on them.
Just sitting there.
Waiting to get smashed in an exciting sequence.

HENRY WU:
The locust's prehistoric DNA has made them stronger than they should be.
They're multiplying like crazy, and they're not dying.
What part of this don't you understand?

DODGSON:
Well, I do understand.

HENRY WU:
This is going to be a global famine.

DODGSON:
Hey, hey.
We can't anticipate everything.
We need to eradicate the ones we've released.

DODGSON:
What?

HENRY WU:
All of them.

MIKE:
His plan with the locusts was what again?
Him and Henry Wu had a good intentions.
But it, they, they genetically engineered locusts to do something, but then it went bad.

JAY:
It got out of control.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then the locusts...

JAY:
And then eventually he sees the error of his ways and burns the rest of the locusts that are still in the facility

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
I just watched this movie.

MIKE:
While also covering his tracks, because he's trying to destroy the hard drive.

JAY:
Yeah.

KAYLA WATTS:
This place?
Not your vibe.

MIKE:
There, there's our friend, Kayla Watts, who's...
And I don't know if...
Again, Colin Trevorrow may be a secret genius because he was fired from Star Wars Part IX.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because he made Book of Henry.
And then everyone panicked because Book of Henry flopped.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
So they fired him from Star Wars IX.
So then we have this Kayla Watts character, who is essentially Han Solo.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Uh, she's a smuggler.
She has her own little aircraft.
And when you're in the cockpit, it looks identical to the Millennium Falcon.

JAY:
The framing of the shots.

MIKE:
The framing of the shots.
The way that you could kind of see the secondary backseats, which probably aren't on a big plane like that.
I don't know.

LUKE:
What's that flashing?

HAN SOLO:
We're losing our deflector shields.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm going to make a jump to light speed.

CLAIRE DEARING:
Why is it blinking?

KAYLA WATTS:
Uh, that's the, uh, Aerial Deterrent System.

MIKE:
And then she's doing the, uh...
When they're trying to land at the Apple headquarters -- the Biosyn headquarters -- she's trying to get landing permission.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And they're like, they're like:
"Permission denied."
You know, it's exactly like when Han Solo's, like, trying to land at, um, the Cloud City.
Or, or fucking around with the, the microphone on the Death Star.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She had that same kind of flair.
So is that, like, his, like:
"Hey, you may have fired me from Star Wars, but I'm putting Han Solo in this movie."

JEFF GOLDBLUM:
I'll tell you.
Colin, that Colin Trevorrow...
He's good.
He's a good director.

MIKE:
Owne Thunderguns and subjugated lady friend, uh, who no longer has a will of her own...

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
But to follow Owen Thunderguns around to the ends of the Earth.
Because they're in love.

JAY:
And people called the first Jurassic World movie sexist.

MIKE:
Right.
She hasn't, she...
Bryce Dallas Howard no longer has a character.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's not the, the, uh, sophisticated women that she was in the first one, where she ran the theme park.
Now she, uh, runs around and tries to save dinosaurs in cages with, like, scared college students who don't wanna do it anymore.

JAY:
They get rid of those characters real quick.

MIKE:
They were the ones from the other one.

JAY:
They were annoying in the last movie.
They're like:
"Ehh, we'll put them in one scene to explain why they're not in the rest of the movie."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Why even bother?
Just don't have 'em in it.

MIKE:
Kayla the pilot spots the little girl in Malta.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Being stolen by Frau Farbissina to, to be sent to Tim Cook at the Apple headquarters because Henry Wu wants Kayla Lockwood to study her genes to fix how they fucked up the process with the locusts and/or save the human race by figuring out a solution to the world's food supply.
This is...
I got a lot from this by barely patying attention.
I was on my phone the whole time.
Uh, half-asleep.
You know, I was playing checkers on my phone.
So then they're flying in her, her Millennium Falcon.
And, and of course, pterodactyls appears.
No one likes pterodactyls, but they always appear in these movies.

JAY:
Well, they can fly, so they're different than other dinosaurs.

MIKE:
They attack the plane.
They fuck the plane up.
And, um, Owen Thunderguns says:
"This plane's gonna crash, Bryce Dallas Howard."
"Jum-..."
"You better eject."

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Because there's only one ejection seat that works, or something.

JAY:
Something like that.

MIKE:
And, uh, uh, I'm man, I'm man...
I'm Owen Thunderguns.
And you're lady.
You're my subjugated lady.
Uh, and you better get out of the plane.
And so they shoot her out.
And so Owen and Kayla crashland in a, in a ice field...
What is it called?
A frozen lake?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And they get out.
And, of course, it's now time for dino set piece.
Dino action set piece.

JAY:
Plug it in.
Boop!

MIKE:
And, and Kayla...
I think at some point it's revealed that she was former military.

OWEN GRADY:
Where'd you learn to fly?

KAYLA WATTS:
Uh, Air Force.
Legacy on my momma's side.

OWEN GRADY:
Yeah.
I'm Navy.

MIKE:
And Owen Thunderguns is also former military ops.
He has all sorts of skills because he was the, the, the, the velociraptor wrangler.

JAY:
Yeah, he trained the dinosaurs in the first movie.

MIKE:
So he, he has skills.
Let's just say he has adventure skills.
He has survival skills.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
This, this is not in doubt, right?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And Kayla also does.
And they start walking on the ice.
The ice begins to crack under their feet.
What do they do?
They walk slower, and more carefully.
Right?

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And there was no dinosaurs around at this time, right?

JAY:
Right.

MIKE:
So there was no threat quite yet.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, what do you do in that situation, Jay?
Common sense.

JAY:
Uh, I would run before it all cracks up.

MIKE:
No, no, no.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
That's a bad idea.

JAY:
Well, what's a good idea then?

MIKE:
What you do in that situation is, you lay down on your belly, and you, you army crawl.
Because...

JAY:
So there's less weight going straight down?

MIKE:
Weight, all your weight is distributed on the soles of your feet.
All your weight is centered on one spot.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Movie-wise, it's more exciting for them to slowly walk on the ice, going...

JAY:
You're building the tension, yeah.

MIKE:
Tension.
Uh, but logically, those two characters would know to lay on their bellies and go like this.
Although it would look really silly.
And, and so that kind of stuff -- even though this is a dumb movie -- kind of takes me out a little bit sometimes.

nacho Bob there's there's our our friend Kayla Watts who's and I don't
know again Colin trevorrow may be a secret genius because he was fired from
Star Wars part nine yeah because he made book of Henry and then everyone panicked
because book of Henry flopped so they fired him from Star Wars nine so then we have this Kayla Watts character
who is essentially Han Solo she's a Smuggler she has her own little
aircraft and when you're in the cockpit it looks identical to the Millennium

the Apple headquarters the biosin headquarters she's trying to get Landing permission yeah and they're like the
permission denied you know it's exactly like when Han Solo's like trying to land at um on the cloud city or or [ __ ]
around with the the microphone on the Death Star yeah she had that same kind of flair so is that his like like hey
you may have fired me from Star Wars but I put Han Solo in this movie I'll tell, you Colin that Colin travaro
he's good he's a good director Owen Thunder guns and subjugated lady friend
uh who no longer has a will of her own yeah but to follow on Thunder guns around to the ends of the Earth
because they're in love and people called the the first Jurassic world movie sexist right she has Bryce Dallas
Howard no longer has a character yeah she's not the the uh sophisticated woman
that she wasn't the first one where she ran the theme park now she uh runs around and tries to save dinosaurs in
cages with with like scared college students who don't want to do it anymore they get rid of those characters real
quick they're the ones from the other one they were annoying in the last movie so like uh we'll put him in one scene to explain
why they're not in the rest of the movie yeah why even bothered just don't have them in a Kayla the pilot spots the
little girl in Malta being stolen by Frau bissona to to be sent to Tim Cook
at the Apple headquarters because Henry Wu wants Kayla Lockwood study her jeans
to fix how they [ __ ] up the problem with the locusts and or save the human
race by figuring out a solution to the world's food supply
this is I got a lot from the spot barely paying attention I was on my phone the whole time
uh half asleep you know I was playing checkers on my phone so then they're flying in her or
Millennium Falcon and they're and of course pterodactyls appear no one likes pterodactyls but they
always put them in these movies well they can fly so they're different they're flying they attack the play and they [ __ ] the plane up and um uh Owen
thundergun says this plane's gonna crash Bryce Dallas Howard John you better eject because there's only one ejection
seat that works or something something like that and uh uh I'm I'm Ma I'm man I'm on Thunder guns and your lady you're
my subjugated lady uh and uh you better get out playing and
so they shoot her out and so Owen and Kayla crashland in in a ice
Fields what is it called the frozen lake yes and they get out and of course now it's time for Dino set
piece Dino action set piece plug it in and and Kayla it I think at some point
it's revealed she was former military where'd you learn to fly
Air Force Legacy on my mama's side yeah I'm Navy and I won Thunder guns I
believe is also former military Ops he has all sorts of
skills because he was the the the the Velociraptor Wrangler yeah he trained
the dinosaurs in the first so he he has skills let's just say he has Adventure skills he has survival skills this is
not in doubt right yes and Kayla also does and they start walking on the ice
the ice begins to crack under their feet what do they do
they walk slower and more carefully
right yes and there was no dinosaurs around at this time right right there so there was no threat quite yet
uh what do you do in that situation Jay Common Sense uh I would run before it all cracks no no no no that's a bad idea
well what's a good idea then what you do in that situation is you lay down on
your belly and you you army crawl because there's less weight going straight down weight
all your weight is is distributed on the soles of your feet all your weight is
centered on one spot okay movie wise it's more exciting for them to to slowly
walk on the ice going you're building the tension tension but
logically those two characters would know to lay on their bellies and go like
this although it would look really silly and and so that kind of stuff even
though this is a dumb movie kind of takes me out a little bit sometimes okay I was checked out by that point I expect
more from Jurassic world Dominion I will say the shot where Bryce Dallas Howard gets ejected from the plane that's a
creative shot that's just kind of locked on her that's something she lands in her thing
in the woods falls out and there's a dinosaur walking around
and then she goes in the water and then the dinosaur kind of looks around for
her and then walks away and then she comes out of the water
I I felt absolutely nothing there was no tension there was no excitement there
was literally nothing other than just like events happened in a season they
happened in a sequence
well I noticed three bits of ADR there's a there's a funny part and I'll play it
in this edit Jeff Goldblum is lecturing students at the Apple University yeah
and that's his job there I guess just to teach maybe as an instructor a chaos instructor he has a history with all
this stuff yeah and he he yells unforeseen consequences occur
unforeseen consequences occur and it's like this wide shot and
he says it's so strangely that this is every line Strangely I know but it didn't even sound like him and I thought
like it was ADR done by like a Jeff Goldblum sound alike they couldn't get him back that day and then like like
Colin trevorrow wasn't around and there then some guy was in the booth just going
and that actor just goes unfortunate car and they're like sure unforeseen
consequences occur all right we're done I just I I have these fantasies in my
head of how things really went and and it was just it just struck me and then there's inserts Kayla when a dinosaur
appears to attack them she says nope
nope and turns and runs okay and it was very
clearly inserted like like it didn't it like we got to have something funny yeah
and then oh and thundergun says what an [ __ ]
and referring to the dinosaur as it falls under the ice I don't remember anything yeah his back is to the camera and he
turns around and he's like I think she's mid-turned when she says Nope but you can see that her mouth isn't moving
so it has that uh like Ghostbusters 2016 syndrome where it's like we have to keep
adding funny things yeah everywhere we need some quips because this this ice scene is is dull and then and then uh
they escape Dino they get in some kind of elevator the door closes
and then they're like they're just like bored and then he's
like are you good and then she goes yeah I'm good and then I I think it was supposed to be
read as like we just went through this like harrowing nightmarish experience where we barely escaped with our lives
yeah are you cool yeah I'm cool like like where they're both really terrified but they're both
trying to play it cool to each other right but to me it read as the characters are just
actors are just whatever well that's how I felt through most of the movie especially with the like Legacy characters like Laura Dern looks like
she doesn't know what the [ __ ] is going on whenever there's any action happening which makes the uh the big scene where
they all finally meet all of our Legacy characters and our new Jurassic World characters they finally meet yeah
they're all in the frame together and I think it's supposed to be like a magical movie moment but everybody's just bored
nobody cares I've kind of fallen in love with Colin I just I just think you know
his his enthusiasm his energy his boundless optimism
he loves these films he loves directing he loves actors you know he's he's just
and then like because they solved the Locust problem we cut to a montage at the end where we're back to our
Instagram uh Tick Tock news reporter re explaining the plot and like we have
nature footage of animals just living in harmony with Dino so we're just going to have to live with them I'm like again
uh nothing's been accomplished in the movie the locusts were stopped but it's still yeah
we still haven't learned anything from a science perspective and I know this isn't this isn't real
life this movie but you you bring over one weird lizard from a foreign country
to the U.S and it just like cripples the entire ecosystem of an entire State
because they multiply they eat food supplies that belong to some other
creature which causes that creature to to either starve out which was the food of a different creature that ate this
plant and it causes like a domino effect having dinosaurs everywhere like living
in harmony with nature is just like batshit unrealistic
but they show like elephant herds walking alongside like those other big
dinosaurs Triceratops they're like like codes and then like seagulls are flying
with pterodactyls and and I'm just like so I'm like I wouldn't mind any of the
stupidity as long as it was fun yeah it's the movie's a slog like I said that
that whole sequence uh the mission impossible sequence where they they find the underground uh dinosaur fights and
they have a Chase through the streets so the dinosaurs are chasing them like at least that's kind of taking advantage of
the concept of the movie and that's kind of it and then the rest of it's just yeah
overstuffed with stub subplots and characters we got to put this in there we got to put that in there it just
feels like checking off boxes of things you're supposed to put in the movie out of curiosity I looked at like
the three Jurassic world films and it's a it's a it's a textbook example of uh
diminishing returns both in critical reception and box office yeah worldwide
I would assume that yeah this one's I think it still did pretty well though right uh yes I have a Graphic here and I
don't quite remember the exact numbers but I want to say the first one uh one 1.3 or 1.6 billion really well
yeah and uh because it was a fairly solid movie in terms of a reboot it was
like a crowd pleaser yeah and it did well the box office but uh a lot of people hate it well sure I didn't like
it uh you famously or infamously gave it a good review and people were kind of baffled you know it was like you said it
was meta sort of self-aware and it had the fun of a theme park falling apart
just on a grander scale than the first one compared to the sequels it feels so much more like cohesive and queens yeah
the second one though I've never stopped thinking about that second movie because it is so bizarrely stupid uh that movie
should be like a cult classic the whole second half taking place in the spooky Mansion with uh
illegal Black Market dinosaur auctions underneath that's that's where they
start to get into this this idea of what what would people do if dinosaurs were everywhere yeah accessible not just a
theme park work and and they kind of [ __ ] that up making like a smart movie series about it which you're not going
to expect in this day and age but the second one I think scraped out just over a billion worldwide and then this third
one uh in the 900 Millions so I mean obviously that's a lot of
money but there's the cost of the film and the promotion and all that kind of stuff so
but another thing to factor in too is that first and second one were pre-pandemic yeah and this one I think
was a pandemic delay maybe but still it was like probably released at a time
when people were like yeah I don't know about going to the movie theaters and so then they're probably just tired of it
like oh another Jurassic world fatigue yeah yeah and it's and or it could have
worked to the movie's favor where the people that did go to the theater who
want to pay what they pay at movie theaters have an option between watching
nothing or Jurassic world Dominion hey we're gonna pay uh if we're going to pay
the prices that we pay at the movie theaters why not watch it two hour and 30 minute long dinosaur movie
like there's a lot of stuff in the movie there's a lot of stuff in the movie rather than watching a 19-minute Art
House film like maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie that we're making there have never been more
dinosaurs we truly that have spared no expense we have
amazing action sequences we have amazing dinosaur sequences we have heart humor Innovative technology
both as like um a story point in the film but also
um epic and I'll tell, you Colin that Colin trevorrow
he's good he's a good director as a narrative around making this film
and we're pioneering brand new technologies to make this film we have more dinosaurs than you've ever seen in
a Jurassic film uh like maximum amount of dinosaurs in this movie new dinosaurs new characters you
know you look up into the stars and you think that's 13 billion light years away
like what does how is that possible that it couldn't you it was a slog it was
uninteresting all I know is I never ever want to see a character in a movie doing this anymore oh yeah yeah yeah it made
sense in the first movie like because Chris Pratt's training those dinosaurs and that's like part of his move for training but now he just does it every
time he sees any dinosaur anywhere and and other people can do it too and other people just do it
and it works I guess I'm gonna try that move next time I'm
attacked by a dinosaur there you go thank God yeah
I'm gonna get her back
no
Guns and Roses present Thor love and thunder AKA 4-4 more four starring
Natalie Portman as Thor in this newest Thor film
well, you're right so Jay in this newest Thor film
uh well they checked off a whole bunch of boxes speaking of the last movie where it just feels like a checklist
uh this movie feels like Taiko watiti was contractually obligated to make
another Thor we were all in it we were all in it together he didn't want to make another Thor so he said I'm just
gonna make it a bunch of goofy nonsense and then Kevin feige said you have to have lady Thor in it so they're like
that's what we're gonna do you're gonna do Mighty Thor which is Jane Foster as Thor
and uh take it with TD's like but I just want to make a bunch of dumb nonsense I just want to make a goofy movie
put that in it you got to put uh Gore the god killer in it it's like the most serious intense
bad guy ever but you got to shove him into a movie that's just nothing but dumb jokes
how does that work oh not very well apparently dang I I was really annoyed
by this move uh normally I like we've we've praised
in the past uh when a filmmaker kind of intentionally throws his own movie uh Gremlins 2 of course
the gold standard for this kind of thing right we were pretty positive on Matrix Four a lot of people didn't like that
but uh those are movies that are doing something interesting with the idea of uh kind of making fun of your own
franchise to kind of be out there about that and this movie just feels like Taiko TD
didn't want to make it so we intentionally just made it a huge joke so in this moment you were there yeah
you're getting anything like this she walks over and she goes but then he still had to shove in those
Marvel elements that are more serious and so he didn't go all the way with it
and it's not really saying anything it's just a bunch of goofy nonsense whether taikum WaTiki movies has he made he did
what we do in the shadows no no no in the Marvel world nothing uh just the last door Thor Ragnarok Thor Ragnarok
okay which I think found a good balance of everything well that's the thing that's the big takeaway from this is
balance um because Thor is now a comedic character
we can collectively take credit for that because we worked as a team we use our hearts and our minds to
defeat the enemy with minimal loss of damage where he's a very serious uh demigod
Norse demigod of I'm Thor the God of Thunder isn't funny when yeah I do this
it led to Fish Out of Water jokes in the first movie sure I think we've mentioned this before but as the franchise has
gone along they realize that Chris Hemsworth's actually pretty funny yes so they make him more comedic and then this
one they turn him into Homer Simpson basically he's uh he's actually space cop in the first scene
that's true he he shows up to help and he causes more damage than than
necessary yeah which is a fun sequence I didn't hate everything in this movie it's that imaginary line that you have
to ride where Thor is a joke when he needs to be but then Thor is serious when the movie needs him to be serious
I.E you throw in cancer in this movie and it does not gel not just throw it in
a hard cut from over-the-top comedic scene to chemotherapy right boom Oh my
God what did we just do yes because that's the history of the lady Thor character yeah and that's what I say
when it's like well we got to put this in here I'm going to rush through it as much as possible yeah because anything with her having cancer it just feels so
brushed over when that should be a pretty heavy uh dramatic Stakes of your
movie I mean there's a lot of things that are smartly done in this like it opens with him
in the desert you know and their their world is dead or dying and him and his
daughter are you know thirsty and they're dying the last of their race the last of their race yeah and then it
opens like you're panning up on desert and and then the very end of the movie there in this big field of water so
there's there's a little like full circleness to that because he finds this the space god
um oh yeah spoilers on everything nobody cares uh it's been so long since all these movies come out we don't give a
[ __ ] he wants the grant he's so angry at the gods because and that's funny too it's like you have this emotional
heart-wrenching scene where his daughter dies and then he finds this Oasis where the gods live and the goddess is a
horrible [ __ ] just mocking him all the gods are [ __ ] and then so you're just getting Concepts I think the
execution again that tonal Whiplash it was just him in the desert that'd be one thing but we just saw his daughter die
right and it's so it's like then all of a sudden the God is super Goofy and comedic like Ugh we just vanquished the
holder of a necro sword before he could harm any other gods with that cursed blade
and so you're setting up your villain's backstory and motivation and and almost
some sympathy for him but then he gets the sword and
then he gets like corrupted and vengeful because the sword is the god killer
sword and it can slay gods and so not just his own God on his own Planet but
he wants to go go after all of them and this becomes a problem for Thor
because Thor is a god it's a good setup for your villain and that's we always complain that a lot of these Marvel
movies the weakest aspect is the villain here the villain's good he's got good backstory he's played by a very good
actor who's taken his job super seriously and he's just in the wrong movie right it's so bizarre he's in the
wrong movie Jane with cancer is in the wrong movie Chris Hemsworth is in half of the wrong
movie depending on the scene I mean he he knows how to like he's perfect he
knows how to do the do the comedy and then kind of like gently segwaying it
into okay Thor has to be serious now yeah and he works but it's just a lot of the other elements seemed kind of all
over the place like a lot of the humor I like I really like the scene where they go to the god
City and Russell Crowe is Zeus that well that's where it's like we're just goofing around and Russell Crowe is I
don't know what his accent is but he's very funny he's trying to do a Greek accent I don't know if it works but but
he's Australian but it's funny yeah it's a little garbled and muddy but that adds
to it and that's again that attitude of like yeah [ __ ] it I don't really care what we're doing we're just goofing around here right right that's where
they go full force into that um so scenes like that are fine
screaming goats it'll be funny just relax the goats are gonna be fine if not we just need to get some meat
they really I was thinking of the uh uh David pumpkin sketch with Tom Hanks
on SNL how's it hanging I think pumpkin it's like why'd you go all in on David
pumpkins because man they seem to think those screaming goats are hilarious
questions it's funny at first and then they just keep doing it so then the general
premises Gore the god killer God Slayer with the sword magic sword
that just exists I'm sure it's in the comments it's fine it's comic book stuff
it's like hey there's a new thing yeah he wants to get to an entity who lives
in the center of the universe called eternity that can grant a wish
and in order to get to the entity he needs to open up a Secret Gate which the
symbol on the gate is the bifrost symbol so he needs Thor's magic ax to open up
the gate in this Temple to lead him to Eternity so that he could Grant uh so
that eternity can grant him the wish to eliminate all the gods in the universe
and of course Thor has to stop them but in order to lure Thor and Friends he kidnaps a bunch of children from new
Asgard uh as Bates who apparently aren't aware that they're in a movie
and all those scenes where they're captured and they're in like their their cage those kids just are like smiling
and boards and they they don't look like they know that they're in a movie oh
oh are you doing the lightsaber thing
looking at the camera oh yeah and there's some fun stuff Thor astrally
projects himself there and he says all the wrong things in front of the kids he doesn't quite know how to talk to them
yeah I can't believe you killed Zeus well, you know what they say never meet your Heroes
uh this is a fun bit where he's trying to talk to him and uh want to face Tessa
Thompson is like tickling his nose so yeah the whole time he's doing this is kind of funny I mean obviously Tycho
WaTiki watiti matidi yeah Taiko with Titi sorry hey everyone I'm talking
white you see I don't know how to say his name I've never said it before uh and knows how to bring the funny
uh uh even though you don't like him personally I well there I guess there's a like a mini controversy around this
movie when it was coming out in theaters and he was doing the promotional rounds and he where he just really came across
and this comes across in the movie where he just didn't take anything seriously and I know he's a comedic person but it
just felt like he was uh did like uh it was like Vogue or Vanity Fair or something where he's doing like a
breakdown of a scene from the movie it's him and Tessa Thompson Hey brother I'm talking white is he and I'm Tessa
Thompson and we're here from Thor 11 Thunder and uh and he's just like ah the special
effects of the scene aren't very good and just like you know if you're self-deprecating is one thing but this
was right around the time when all the Articles and stories were coming out about of the the effects artists for
these movies are horribly overworked and deadlines are constantly being crushed
and all these things does that look real in that particular shot no actually
is that alone like make fun of your direction and he just came across like he didn't give a [ __ ] about the movie
like like too cool for it almost uh and I found that very off-putting as opposed
to Someone Like A James Gunn who is his movies are comedic they also have a
tough time balancing tones I think he does it much better and then Taiko TD just feels like I did that Thor Ragnarok
movie I had a concept for that so we made that movie and I guess I gotta make another one
it's because it used to be when he would wake up that was my reality but you just
left it there randomly you said that I never noticed it I'm
never looking at you trust me I did because how big do you want the dick
and then what happens if you take that footage you put it in the confusion a
little bit it's like blue Lightning stuff I didn't really like when Thor just said I can give all my Thor powers to
children I can just hand out my Thor powers to anyone temporarily that's news to me
that that's a power that he has would have been helpful during that battle against Thanos
let's zap out all those Thor powers to everybody it seemed a little like but we can't have just Thor beating the
bad guy right it would have been to me more exciting if the kids were all in
danger and hiding and barely escaping and hiding under this and that and Thor was
like fighting furiously to protect them at every cost you know but instead it
seemed lazy it seemed like a convenience a plot convenience like they just made it up oh it just hands out his powers
yeah here's where someone tells us that he can hand out his powers it's in Thor issue number 382. I mean that's fine if
that's a power but movie-wise don't just pull it out of your ass at the end of the movie movie-wise it felt like it was
pulled out of out of his ass out of the movie's ass and like you said I don't know if that's true if that you know
Marvel people said you gotta have this kind of this I don't know if that's actually the case that would that's what it felt like because he made that first
Thor movie he did a good job then he went off and made his JoJo rabbit it's one of those like one for them one for
me kind of situations like oh [ __ ] now I gotta go back and make another Thor movie all I know is the Man created
a little movie called what we do in the shadows and and uh the TV show is
probably the best thing I've seen in a very very long time oh yeah and when we finally finally understand why the
movie's called that it's because he's got the little girl with him now we're like yeah but who's this little girl like I know it's Gore's daughter but
that kind of just happened here have my daughter as I die well I thought the
ending was kind of sweet we needed we needed I know obviously she
dies at the very beginning of the movie but we need something more with that daughter just the idea of like oh I'm gonna take
your daughter now wow this felt so like rushed compared to everything else yeah I mean if if there
was some kind of logic to it it would be like uh like a soul for a soul kind of
situation like maybe I get it yeah thematically what they're doing yeah story wise Jane had to die in order to
save the little girl which which you know disarmed the enemy the bad guy wouldn't wish for
um because I don't know I don't know the the rules of of The Eternity character
but the bad guy chose love over hate and decided not to kill all the gods if
if the thing would resurrect his daughter but he had to die and then Jane had to die and then they
um Thor was stuck with the little girl which I thought was fun he just got to raise a kid and she's part God now and
they're NOW Thor love and thunder they're a team and they run around and save planets
it's a whole new adventure Jake I can't wait for her Disney plus series that I won't watch oh
you were you were more of an old man than me that's not true I have some spark of
hope left in me like you said issues with it
inconsistency with tone logic uh what are we doing you know and
then did you watch the post-credits stuff uh oh there's something with uh Russell Crowe at the very yeah I was
excited about that well that just means he didn't die which I guess is good because it was a little [ __ ] up that Thor just kills him
it's like oh okay he didn't die Thor kills Zeus yeah like like well I was like that's a little unlikely as it was
just like there with this hole in his chest he's like I'm fine but I realize that us as Gods we've we've become a
joke and it's time to bring back our wrath and make them fear us again and then he goes he goes Hercules and then
they pan over and uh it's the guy from The [ __ ] Ted lasso show oh really you
ever watch that show a bunch of bunch of crap everybody loves them so much so bad
here we go in three two one Tom Cruise returns as the character of
Top Gun the first film came out 62 years ago and had a homoerotic volleyball
scene this new film is updated for a hip new audience by having a homoerotic football scene oh and there's ladies now
so it's not quite as homoerotic unfortunately the movie also has a soundtrack filled with Dad Rock and it's
like the fifth highest grossing movie of all time in the film Tom Gunn has to teach a class of Pilots how to fly their
planes more better and bomb a lunchbox at the base of a mountain valley it's a dangerous and complicated flight path
with little chance of survival hey don't drones exist now I watched top gun
Maverick which I had zero interest in and within 20 minutes I was like hey this feels like a real movie and it was
very exciting laughs yeah my my reaction to it like I had no
interest in it because I saw I think I saw the original Top Gun a long time I've seen it once and I remember
thinking it was fine yeah yeah it's just not my thing yeah like like uh it's like race cars race
cars and airplanes I don't care about he's an adrenaline junkie that man yes um but this is a movie that would not be
made today if it wasn't for the star power still existing star power of Tom Cruise yeah and it's such a star power
it's like uh influencer influence uh Obsession for Perfection it's very
important to me that it'd be practical and I said I'm not going to make this film unless we can accomplish that uh
he's like the real deal when it comes to like insane like I'm gonna get this done
yes and that's the big uh the big thing but it's not distracting I think there
was one like one of the Mission Impossible movies where he's like hanging under a helicopter or playing
he's climbing on something and yeah they've got cameras under there where they're like you could tell they're like
filming through this thing and then yeah it looks like it was impressive but you
could tell like that the way he the way that it was shot was not cinematic it
looked more like documentary footage because that's the only way they could shoot it but this doesn't feel that way
no and all those actors are really in jets flying around and uh you know I
read a little bit about it they had to go through training and they were always throwing up and
um they they were required once the plane took off the actor themselves were
required to run the camera yeah I saw that do their own makeup kind of thing
because no one could communicate with them and and and so pretty intense like unusual filming
circumstances in order to make this and then they filmed a bunch of stuff and they come back down and look at it and they're like nope do it again
yeah I saw Miles Teller talking about one time they had to redo a whole scene because he just didn't record hit record
on the camera or something right yeah so it's like yeah but that's the selling point of the movie is that these are all
real things happening we don't have a little cockpit set and a green screen
yeah and you know the lighting makes it look completely unrealistic and unnatural
like you make a movie like this because that's what the movie is yes and and as far as the story goes all the things
necessary to make a movie Blockbuster it was done with like the the pinpoint
Precision of a of a guided bomb a laser-guided bomb like everything yeah
and and it's almost like it's certainly I don't know if you want to call this a soft reboot or a sequel that's
definitely one of those Legacy sequels is what they say now yeah because it's like the beats are all there he's the
he's the instructor now there's the group of Hotshot Pilots he's got the
love interest um you have the shirtless uh Sports scene all the famous scenes the the you
know at the beginning of the movie I thought I was watching the first movie I thought I [ __ ] up somehow because we get all the shots of the plane and like
the font of the credits and then the highway to the danger zone song it's like did I put on the first movie
somehow yeah there's two two changes I learned in the opening titles thing it's
like oh so the Air Force has a secret blah blah blah program and um
it said the it says before it said the men of the this fighter announces men
and women okay and it says in order to to ensure the best pilots in the world
it was spelled i-n-s-u-r-e and they change it to en they [ __ ] up the first time
taxiing with information Alpha Darkstar your credit taxi Runway 2-1 he hit all
these points like all the points right flies in a super modern plane
the most modernist of modern planes I thought it was a SR-71 Blackbird when they showed it and
I was like oh cool but I think that's been retired it's like a spy plane I know nothing about planes so it's it's
what the X-Men fly around in oh it looks like that it's a big black plane and it's meant for like dodging radar so it
was one of those and and he has to get to Mach 10. he's trying to see if he can yeah make it to mach 10 and uh Ed pushes
it a little too far because he doesn't play by the rules because he's Top Gun right and um
and that part when it first takes off yeah and the uh we have that wide shot on the ground and that the the roof of
that building comes off that wasn't supposed to happen right and so it's like oh that's great yeah like real
things happens this wasn't a CG plane and they're like we can't do it again it's just too expensive to do it again
because they're flying a real high-tech jet yeah so you have high-tech jets that exist
um but in the movie they have to use um slightly older planes probably
because in the logic of the real world they couldn't just give the production of this movie 10 like super expensive
high quality top of the line fighter jets to use for Tom Cruise to play with in his movie sure they're like we'll
give you a 5 10 Jets to shoot with and the pilots that will pilot them but
they're not going to be like maybe a few years old sure and that also adds into the storyline because they
have to do this Mission and the bad guys have more advanced Jets so that adds a little threat there do they ever
establish where they go no I don't think they do right because they know can't get away with that wherever we put it
it's gonna offend somebody well they they don't in the first one either okay it's just like like non-descript bad guy
because it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter and it and it doesn't matter to the
um the pilots yeah they're they're all about performing their mission with Precision yeah and getting out safely so
the the global politics of it doesn't matter to them from an odd that's like
the only if I had to pick a really small thing that would be the only thing it'd be like well if this crazy country I'm going to
assume it was North Korea I'll explain in a minute okay um uh if this crazy country does
something with the nukes they're gonna they plan to blah blah blah but the the threat was that they had an underground
nuclear reactor that was going to go online and they're going to start enriching uranium and once uraniums are
enriched that's when it becomes like dangerous when you blow it up it causes all sorts of damage so there is a threat
but if they established the importance of that threat maybe it would
have helped a little bit but really the story was about the character about the personal Stakes the personal stakes and
the characters coming home alive and and Tom Cruise uh learning uh trying to get
Goose's son and played by Miles Teller uh to trust
him again and forgive him for the death of his father yeah so that's really the
story um and that's the important part but uh the bad guys have that like weird
fake logo on their plane and you never see them you said the helmet you don't want to show some like Korean guy you
can't show anyone but I guess yeah I forgot that that was an element of the first movie too so it's like okay well that carries over it worked I only saw
the first Top Gun once I've seen Hot Shots like 50 times call them
Hot Shots the mother of all movies in this movie
they fly over water off of the aircraft carrier and they enter like snowy peaked mountains yeah North Korea the north of
it is very Rocky and snowy mountainous so you probably it's probably Kim Jong-un making nukes sure the wink wink
that's that's that's the one country you can offend North Korea you don't worry about their box office returns you don't
live in China and there was controversy early on about his patch on his jacket so it was like
country neutral to not offend China blah blah blah they like digitally removed it uh I think just changed it from the same
patch that he had in the first month oh okay
I have to look this up and I'll put up like a story about it somehow so you can read it because I don't really care that
much about it but so yeah that's fine but um the you know the movie bounces
back and forth between regular film and IMAX so you know the action and excitement's
coming when your aspect ratio gets wider it's the old Christopher Nolan trick yeah and it's great that's this is one
movie where I didn't give a [ __ ] about it when it came out it's like I don't care about another Top Gun but uh now
I'm like I kind of wish I would have seen that in a theater it would look great well that's the thing is like story wise it's fine it does enough of
what you need to do to establish the the uh what's it rooster right that's uh Goose's son and Tom Cruise their kind of
History uh and it's fine does that well enough but then you get to the third act which is just all action and it's
legitimately exciting to watch which I can't say usually by the time you get to the third Act of a lot of bigger movies
now I'm just like when is it over right yeah yeah it's a Jurassic world like how long it just keeps going right and here
it's like it rejuvenates the movie yeah yeah and uh you mentioned that it takes place in like a snowy landscape that's
like a nice visual change of pace from where we've been the rest of the movie so that helps too yeah they're
practicing in like California or in Nevada or something where they can fly around in canyons and practice the only
thing that it probably didn't need is a love interest but that's one of those ways you got to put that in there no you
got to put that in there yeah we're not going to bring back uh Kelly McGillis from the first movie
I'm not saying anything personal about her but I know the way the Hollywood thinks they're not casting here yeah I
guess I guess Jennifer Conley who was like 12 when the first movie came out she's about 10 years younger than Tom
Cruise Tom Cruise just celebrated his 60th birthday Jennifer Connelly's in her early 50s so it's not like absurd
age-wise but I know what you mean but you know why it's in there you know why it's in there and that's kind of
disappointing because um Kelly McGillis kind of looks like a grandma now
but you know Jennifer Connelly of course aged well um and so it's like well we have to have
a lot of interest but we can't bring back Kelly McGillis I think she was the instructor in the first movie
right Kelly McGillis yeah something like that and and so they had a little romance so it would be weird if she came back to because he's the instructor now
yeah logically it makes sense but you know the reason why Tom Cruise looks
like he's 30 and you don't want him smooching on a grandma and he doesn't want to do that
you can be my wingman anytime [ __ ] you can be mine yeah
it had all those like beats because I think wasn't Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer kind of like adversaries yeah like
Iceman and then they'd learn to be friends at the end and that's kind of like the uh hangman character in this
with rooster you know it's all very self-aware that they're
repeating the first movie just doing it on a grander more bigger visual scale
yeah more modern technology and that's it's a prime example of like it's not always necessarily the story you're
telling it's how you tell it right and if this was a bunch of people on green screens like none of it would have
worked yeah yeah you mentioned Val Kilmer comes back and obviously he's limited with what he can
do now and I think they handled that pretty well yeah um they worked it into the story uh and
I like that there seems to be a history in between the first movie in this one as opposed to a lot of these movies
where they bring back the characters from the original and it's like they've done nothing between movies uh their
whole life exists in that first movie and then they just stop Jurassic world so you can kind of say that about Sam
Neil Han Solo but this one it's like yeah he has a history with Jennifer Connelly with their kid and that's all
kind of established without going overboard on Exposition but it's there and with uh rooster Miles Teller and his
mother played by Meg Ryan and the first one and who has died in between the two films and she told Tom Cruise don't let
him get into fighter piloting it's going to get blowed up
um and so like he delays his his admit mittens to the Naval Academy
because that's what was the wishes of his mother was what Tom Cruise doesn't tell him that so he had some drama
why'd you pull my papers at the Academy why did you stand in my way effective even the corny kind of
predictable plot things all worked yeah just because it's just like this is the
movie We're making we're making a big summer blockbuster movie about fighter jets
um and we're doing it exactly precisely the way it needs to be done without overdoing elements without being too
stupid um and we're we're really going to focus on high quality action sequences
but yeah the the they go in there their Adventure at the end they train
for it I think that's that's what makes the ending effective is that you know the stakes uh not just the
nuclear bad guys getting nuclear power or uranium but the difficulty of the
mission and it's all very explained very clearly how it's down to time in seconds and they have to perform all these
Maneuvers they they're getting eight ten G's flying up out of this Canyon it's
like a perfectly designed like Mission that's super difficult and you could I'm
sure some people hated this movie because they hate Tom Cruise is in case it's ego maniac and it's it's wins in
the end and thinks he's so awesome hey he's responsible for getting a movie
multiple movies at this point made that have like real action scenes in it that are exciting to watch because you know
they're real yeah all those Mission Impossible movies uh there's some great stuff in there
especially coming after uh watching Thor and and Jurassic world which just feels
so phony it feels like you're watching a like a I don't know a fast food commercial or something yeah yeah it
just goes on for two and a half hours right but uh they yeah they
they do their mission it's [ __ ] exciting and then we have a little twist where they gotta get in the old plane
yes yeah he and all the dads in the theater clapped he's like we're gonna
we're gonna get a super modern ass plane I'm gonna shoot up into the atmosphere and flight what 10 10 not 10 knots 10 uh
10 G's no 10 G is like the weight the gravity it's a maktan oh yeah sorry the
speed and uh that's going to be awesome that I'm gonna fly around in an okay plane but then at the end I'm getting
the old F-14 fighter pilot from the first movie and it puts them at a
disadvantage yeah it was at a low Point yes and they have to they have to dog fight uh in in the old plane and figure
it out and it's exciting and adventurous and Miles Teller saves them at the end
all sorts of goodness it's adventurous it's exciting it's expertly done but
they're saying like Tom Cruise Tom Cruise saved the movie theaters well that's yeah that's the crazy thing this
is like the fifth highest grossing movie of all time now is it that good not
really but I think the fact that it's done so well is just uh shows how people are just starved for
like real movies yeah and it's a good example of like a theatrical experience
that's worth it yeah it's like I think back to like I don't know everyone everybody went nuts for the dark night
because it's like holy [ __ ] there's so much real stuff in this movie and there's iMac sequences and it's like
yeah it feels like a reason to see a movie and the opposite of that is Jurassic world Dominion yeah that's such
a slog to sit through yeah um
they really love talking about their real rubber dinosaurs they had in there they had a couple oh
we're just like Tom Cruise we got real things in our movie too
uh so uh uh yeah that's that I don't have
much else to say about that movie but if it's still playing in theaters I'd go watch it in a theater check it out even
if you have to deal with people eating nachos on your own lap does that happen to you a lot at the
theater yeah yeah they oversold tickets so this fact I had to sit on my lap the
whole time and eat his nachos and I spilled all over my clothes and all the nacho cheese got in my hair and my eyes
and he kept farting right on top of me that's to be expected yeah and I
couldn't see the screen and it was a miserable experience but but luckily it was for Jurassic world Dominion so it
kind of worked out in your favor
foreign
what would you recommend top gun Maverick yes that's it that's it uh with a with a
pretty good recommendation for Thor love and thunder uh uh definitely not Jurassic world
Dominion uh Thor love and thunder is fun Chris Hemsworth is charming as Thor uh
there's some good gags in it a little uneven so it falls in the middle range but it's a watchable movie it's fun you
may not have liked it I didn't love it but I thought it was uh certainly watchable but top gun Maverick exceeds
both of them yes yes with uh uh exceeds both of them by a long shot
oh Mike we finally talked about some big summer movies instead of more Indie hipster garbage that's right Jay some of
the biggest most successful most popular films of 2022 yeah and I guess now we
have nothing left to watch but uh Miracle Valley directed by Greg sestero
from the room it's a 2B original what's a 2B
to be your not to be that is the question but before we watch Miracle Valley
directed by Greg cestro of the room we've got to take our next dose of glambiza oh thank God because I'm
fiending you know no one's ever said that pain pills were addictive
why don't they tell people these things
ah how many refills are left how many refills
no refills oh [ __ ]
I guess we gotta make them last oh wait a minute wait wait a minute it's
kicking again I feel all my joints
frightening up uh sweet pain-free effects of glimbiza
I don't make watching Miracle Valley directed by Greg sustrow of the room that much more enjoyable
hey maybe it's a good film I don't know I haven't watched it yet all right it's a 2B original
they're not going to bankroll just anything I think truby is who I get my life
insurance policy through all right I'm about to hit play I see it I see it I
see it what what happened oh did you hit something to hit the car wrong button no
no the goddamn internet's down oh my God how are we supposed to watch more movies on streaming oh no we were just about to
watch Miracle Valley directed by Greg sestero of the room I was looking forward to watching this film well Jay
since we can't watch any movies on streaming I think it's about time you watch Star Trek the Next Generation with
me oh my god look I happen to have the very first episode on VHS it's called
encounter at farpoint and it's the most boringest thing ever we gotta start at the beginning
well if we're gonna do that we have to get the VCR fixed because I think it's broken oh my God
huh for some strange reason the name Lightning Fast VCR repairs popped into my head never heard of it you know I
even think they have a location that's pretty close to us never heard of it I'll go give them a
call never heard of it for some reason I have their phone number memorized in my
head I've never heard of it never heard of it
I don't know what you're talking about sounds like [ __ ] to me
oh
how's it going
thank you
calling to get a VCR repaired something very familiar about all this
