PLINKETT:
Half in the bag!

JAY:
Ugh!
It's nice having a week off from the VCR repair game, wasn't it?

MIKE:
I haven't touched this VCR in a month.

JAY:
What'd you do in your week off?

MIKE:
Well, I saw a couple of films at the theater.
I saw, um, the Green Lantern.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And Mr. Popper's Penguins.

JAY:
What did you, what did you think of them?

MIKE:
Oh, I didn't actually see them.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
I, I bought a ticket for the Green Lantern, but I didn't watch it.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Um, cuz I have, like, a fetish.
It's like a sadomasochistic fetish being publicly humiliated.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
It really, it, it fucking turns me on.
Like, so I go:
"One for the Green Lantern."
And, and the girl behind the counter goes like that.
And I go:
"Snicker at me...!"
And, and then I come back after it's over and I say:
"One for Mr. Popper's Penguins."
And then everybody was laughing at me.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You know, they say:
"Who would see this movie?"
I said:
"I would like to."
And then they just started laughing in my face.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
Little did they know I had a raging hard-on.

JAY:
Hmm.

MIKE:
So.

JAY:
Well, hey everybody!
Welcome to another episode of Half in the Bag.
I, I didn't see you there.

MIKE:
Oh.
I didn't know we were rolling.

JAY:
Yeah, we've been rolling.

MIKE:
Can you cut that out?

JAY:
Uh, yeah.
I'll cut it out.

MIKE:
The whole conversation?

JAY:
I'll cut that whole part out.

MIKE:
Okay.
Hello!
And welcome to Half in the Bag.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
And I'm Jay.

MIKE:
And this is going to be a special episode because, uh, we took a week off from working on the VCR, and we participated in Milwaukee's 48-Hour Film Project.
And if you don't know what the 48-Hour Film Project is, it's pretty self-explanatory.
It's a contest where you and a team of people trying to make a short film within 48 hours.
And whoever makes the best film, wins, essentially.
So you have to conceive the film, shoot it, edit it entirely.
So it is quite the challenge.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
The first year we drew...
Our genre was horror.
We made Das Foot, which was a comedy.

MIKE:
What I do is, I make midget home repair videos.

JOGGER:
Oh.

MIKE:
Because, you know, midgets, they have smaller homes than normal people.
Little tiny doors.
Little tiny light bulbs.
Little cabinets.

JOGGER:
Sure.
Oh, yeah.
That's so cute.

JAY:
The second year, we drew "Western or musical", so we decided to make The Western Ore ("O-R-E") Musical.

MIKE:
A fucking musical about rock.

JAY:
Yes, which was also a comedy.

OBSIDIAN JONES:
On the count of three, we draw pistols.
And we fire at the other man's genitals.

MIKE:
It was very...very clever, that one.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
This year, not so clever.
Um...

JAY:
This year, we went the exact opposite.

MIKE:
Yeah...

JAY:
And just made the stupidest, weirdest, most vulgar movie possible.
There's a kickoff event that you go to and draw your genre, literally draw, draw your genre out of a hat.
And then you are given elements that have to be in the movie, which is a character, a line of dialogue, and a prop.

MIKE:
So this year, the, the categories were...
The character name was Simon Taggert.
Or I think it was Susie or Sally Taggert.
A female equivalent.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Usually they do that where there's a male or female.
And the occupation of this character was a chess player.
The prop was a pillow, and the line of dialogue was:
"Where did you get it?"
And we all broke and, and left to brainstorm at a different location.
And, uh, that's kind of where things got interesting.

JAY:
Should we take a look at what props we have?

MIKE:
That's a good start.

JAY:
The nice thing about drawing sci-fi this year is that we had a lot of props all ready.

MIKE:
Yeah.
We, we had an interesting team.
Um, we had a lot of comedy people on our team.
We had...
Let's see, we had our friend Jack, who you might have seen from numerous short films that we did.
He's also known for making the high-five videos on funnyordie.com.
Uh, we had our friend Laura, uh, who was in Feeding Frenzy.
Played the Russian lady in Feeding Frenzy.
And, uh, also looks very similar to a certain police officer who was here, um...

JAY:
I noticed that, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah, she looks a lot like that Officer Cooper.

JAY:
They look a lot alike.
It was weird.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And we had our friend, Dan, who, um, who you may have seen in the Dudebros.

JAY:
If you've been unfortunate enough to watch the Dudebros.

DUDEBRO:
Douche-hole?

MIKE:
And, of course, Jocelyn, our friend Jocelyn, who is also an actress.
She's a kind of a more serious, dramatic actress.
But she took part in the film.
Although she wasn't there for the brainstorming.

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
She was just there to act.
Wait.
We have aliens, too.

JAY:
So we need a main villain, and we...

MIKE:
We brainstormed well into...

JAY:
Well into the evening.

MIKE:
Past midnight.

JAY:
Till like, 1:00 in the morning or so.

MIKE:
Yeah.
So.

JAY:
And so just one idea after the other, and...

JACK:
Lora could be in search of the proper vagina.

LORA:
Get back to church, mister!
Because this here attitude lately has been ridiculous!

JAY:
When you have that many people involved, there's lots of opinions.
And so there was a lot of bickering, probably more from me than anybody else.

MIKE:
Yeah.
No one got angry, though.

JAY:
No one got angry, but it was just sort of finding an idea that everyone was happy with.

LORA:
What the fuck are you talking about?

JAY:
We finally decided to go with the very last idea we came up with at the very end of the night.
After hours of brainstorming, you're like:
"Let's just do this."

MIKE:
So that's the plot.
So when the, when the idea is done, that's when things become a hectic nightmare.

JAY:
It's 2:30, and we've shot one scene so far.
But we just ate some delicious pizza.
So at least there's that.

MIKE:
If I were to give advice to someone who wants to do this...
One, obviously, is the technical stuff.
Getting wired up!
I mean, it doesn't have to look, like, you know, a cinematic work of art.

JAY:
Ours doesn't.
The basics are, make sure things are well-exposed, and that you have microphones.
You have a good sound source that's clean, whether it's a shotgun mic or you put wireless microphones on your actors.

LORA:
Oh, sorry!
I didn't go to microphone-placing school like you assholes!

MIKE:
We've seen a lot of films where people would shoot in a bar and plop the camera down 12 feet away from the actors, where there's, like, the bar refrigerators humming.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And the camera mic is the onward mic twenty feet away.
And when you watch on the big screen, it's like...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
When the day is young, and you're starting off, it's fun.
And then, when you realize it's 8:00 or 9:00 at night, and that you have 90% of the film to shoot still...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And you go:
"Oh, shit."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And everyone starts getting tired.
And spirits dip.
And people get cranky.

LORA:
This guy's a giant asshole.
You think:
"Oh, you get to film this ridiculous things for fun."
And he's always like:
"The monkey suit's hot."
And:
"Where's my water?"
And:
"Somebody blah blah blah."
Nonstop.
Every time I've worked with this asshole.
I don't even know why I do it, to be honest with you.
I hate, fucking hate both of them.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

JACK:
Working for Red Letter Media Inc. is the worst!

MIKE:
I can't even say I think we're getting good stuff.

DAN:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I don't know.
I think we're slap-happy at this point.

DAN:
Yeah.

JESSI:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I think it's really late.
And anything's funny.
At about 8 o'clock at night, you know, Jay said:
"I'm done filming."
Uh, what'd you say?
"Fuck you."
"Fuck everyone."
He kind of cursed us and called us jackasses, and said he's never doing this again.
But, basically, he said he was going to go edit.
Start the editing process.
And then I grabbed the helm and take over shooting.

JAY:
Yeah.
Which actually was a good move.

MIKE:
It worked perfectly because there was a lot of stuff still to get.
But we shot for a couple more hours, and you got a lot of editing done.
So it was good to kind of split off like that.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So today we are working on music.
Also, we are doing visual effect shots for our space scenes.
Jay was editing the movie.
Jack and Jessi were making, um, music.
And I was shooting the special effect.
And then later on, Jack had his laptop, and was doing After Effects, blurring out parts of the video.
Jay was cutting the picture.
And then I was doing the compositing for the, the visual effect.

JAY:
Three computers going at once...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
To finish this thing.
Suggestions and comments.
Uh...

MIKE:
More, we need more time.

JAY:
We came right down to the wire.
We ended up turning the movie in two minutes from the deadline.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
So, which is, uh, a running thing every year.
It seems like we're right down to the line.

MIKE:
Weird how that happens.
I enjoyed doing the 48-hour film festival.
It's, it's, it's fun.
It's challenging.
I don't know if...
This might be my last year for it.

JAY:
It was more stressful this year than it has been in the past.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And I think part of that is just that we get way too ambitious with it.
When you have a bunch of creative people, which we did this year...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
It becomes more and more collaborative.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And kind of goes out of control.

MIKE:
I mean, there were points where there, the morale was kind of low and things kind of dragged.
But then it would pop back up when we'd shoot something really funny.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
And I think everyone had a good time on the shoot.

JAY:
Well, maybe we should let the, the people judge for themselves what they think of the movie.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
This is going to be the internet premiere of our new 48-hour film contest film, which is called The Great Space Jam.
Uh...
Roll it, Johnny!

VOLUPTOR:
I am Queen Voluptor of the Star Empire.
My reign is known throughout vast regions of space.
Today I am to embark on the greatest galactic quest ever.
To conquer the Fragnon Empire.
With my loyal starfleet.
I decree that the war shall be named Space Jam.
And it will strike fear in the hearts of our enemies.
And with out loyal, evil alien ally, the Brothers Warner, will this be the most destructive and greatest war ever!
However, our strategy was to announce the war.
And to show all of the destruction on a very carefully, pre-selected, intergalactic web URL.
www2.warnerbros.com/spacejam/movie/jam.htm
However, this URL is currently still being used as a promotional website for a movie called Space Jam, released in 1996?
I must have this website to transmit my plans for intergalactic war!
My mission is to find the location of the server on planet Earth that houses this website and destroy it!
Then I can be queen of the universe!

SUE PETERSON:
So when I was 15, I knew that one girl who had the cutest haircut.
And I've been trying to get that haircut forever.
And do you remember when I was pregnant with Jeffrey, and you were so rude about everything.
And did you also know -- I heard this at the PTA meeting two weeks ago -- that Sally Johnson's daughter got the gay?
You know, you need to come to church with me.
You've been so weird lately.
Do you still have the...

SIMON TAGGERT:
Sue!
Sue!
We've got a message on the fucking communication-a-tron!

SUE PETERSON:
Holy crap!

SIMON TAGGERT:
It's from the Commissioner of Space!

COMMISSIONER OF SPACE:
This is the Commission of Space.
We have an emergency.
And I'm in need of my top two space agents: Simon Taggert and Sue Peterson.

SUE PETERSON:
Holy crap!
What's our mission?

COMMISSIONER OF SPACE:
The evil Queen Valuptor has arrived in Earth's orbit with afleet of space destroyers.
She's up to no good.
You must infiltrate her ship and find out what she's up to.

SIMON TAGGERT:
Got it, Commissioner!
Sue!
We've got an important mission!
Let's go!

SUE PETERSON:
This spaceship is super roomy.
I like it.
I feel just super safe here.
Will you frigging slow down?
Why are you going so fast?
You're in such a gosh darn hurry.
You always do this.
Anytime you get yourself in a metal box.
You go 2,000 miles an hour.
Oh, crap!
Can we stop at that nail salon on Mars?
Good god in heaven!
This place is nasty pa-tathy!
It reminds me of that one time that Sue was remodeling her basement.
Do you remember that?
And she had that big Krua.
Those people that couldn't speak English.
And they came in there and they just made it so gosh-darned pretty.
Except she had that fake wood, and it made it look so ridiculous.
And do you remember when you were dating Carrie?
And you guys wanted to fix your kitchen.
And I said:
"You need to go with that Spanish tile."
Did you hear Billie Mays died?
I just could not believe it.
And then he...
I heard he had a coke addiction or some crap.
And it made so much sense.
Because I thought to myself:
"Why is one person so excited about mops?"
Did you know that insects could rape each other?
Can gorillas rape each other?
Or do you guys mainly just dry hump?
Because I...

SIMON TAGGERT:
They've discovered us!
Let's move!

SUE PETERSON:
I always thought gorillas were super horny!
Did I ever tell about the time I found a whole colony of mice living in my vagina?
I swear.
I went to take a piss, and this little tail came out.
Do you remember that one time you were banging that lemur, and she split in half like a hotdog in the microwave?
Just right in half.
And all her guts all over.
And we had to cover up that murder.
And we buried her.
And then her lemur family came over and were like:
"[unintelligible]."
Isn't it weird that lemurs speak Russian?
Oh, my god!
You've gotta stop!
You better stop this, you evil alien bitch!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Who are you?

SUE PETERSON:
Doesn't matter who I am.
But if you need to know, I'm Sue Peterson, and this is my kickass friend, Simon.
We're here to stop you from taking down the Space Jam website.

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Silence!

SUE PETERSON:
You don't understand.
My kids love that crap.

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
I have been waiting my whole damn life for this website.
And not you, nor anyone will be able to take that away from me.
Space Jam for Queen Valuptor.
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Yes!
Aughhh!

SUE PETERSON:
Some guys find these attractive!
I don't know why!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Stop kissing.
No, no!
Oh!
She is too strong.
Fuck-Bot 5000, take care of the ape!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
Hey, monkey!
I'ma rape you!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Brothers Warner, it is now time to unleash your giant alien cocks...and fuck that woman to death!

SUE PETERSON:
Ay-ya!
Ay-ya!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
Oh, snap!
Now you're mine, bitch!
Where did you get it?
I gave it to you...through rape!

SUE PETERSON:
Your dicks are so giant and horribly strong!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
You are mine now!
You are mine now!

SUE PETERSON:
Yaughhh!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
I will remember you, always!

SUE PETERSON:
Yeah!
Take that, you alien dickholes!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
Fuck!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Ugh!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
Fuck!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Ugh!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
I want to fuck more!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Oh!

SUE PETERSON:
Yeah, you bitch!
Don't fuck with a housewife!
Now take this cock and eat it up!
Take this alien cock, you bitch!
You don't know shit!

QUEEN VALUPTOR:
Okay!
I give up!
You can have the Space Jam website.
I'll just create a GeoCities page instead.
Fuck everything.

JAY:
So, that's our 48-hour film.

MIKE:
Yep.
It's, uh...
Wow, it was terrifying.

JAY:
It's, it turned out to be more of a horror film than I think we originally planned.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And that robot was, just...

MIKE:
Yes, I wouldn't want to get raped by that robot.

FUCK-BOT 5000:
Oh, dang!
It must be my birthday!
Because I found some white boys!

MIKE:
Oh!

FUCK-BOT 5000:
Ah ha ha ha!
I can ejaculate at 1,000 words per minute!
You're not even the best I've had!
