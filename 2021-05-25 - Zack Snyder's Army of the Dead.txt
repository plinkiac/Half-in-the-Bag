half in the bag i just tend to like
human beings
and i want them to be happy uh
so i don't torture them too much
oh mike the cdc says we can take our
masks off now
huh
ah but just last week dr fauci said that
wearing three to six masks was something
that we should do
i don't know anymore well are the cases
going down
i don't know i mean they must be since
they're not reporting the death toll
every minute of every day anymore
well what's the current infection rate i
have no idea
i just know that they said we don't have
to social distance anymore and
everything's starting to open up again
well i guess coronavirus is over then
well not really
i mean you still have to wear your masks
some places like the doctor's office
on an airplane adult video stores
that's a very specific place well it
just i don't know
it seemed like you were going to say
that next i
i uh i don't know about that but but
some retailers say you have to wear
masks
some do like what about target no mask
walmart no masks grocery stores like
albertsons
yes masks uh sam's club no mask costco
only if you're ricky schroeder he went
from silver spoons
to plastic ones uh
walgreens yes mask wall burgers no mask
unless you're vietnamese cvs pharmacy
yes mask
if it's a standalone store no mask if
it's inside a target
or no mask and target until you get
close to the cvs
inside target then yes mask nice and
simple
well what about something like disney
world no mask outside
but yes mask inside you can take off
your mask for eating but only if you're
eating outdoors
if you're eating indoors it's mask on
but then off when you're taking bites
then back on again
can you drink through your mask with a
beverage no mask
i mean yes mask and lastly if mickey
mouse gets close to you then yes mask
for sure yes mask you know all those
people in costumes are perverts right
right allegedly who is vaccinated now
who is immune i don't know nobody knows
is coronavirus still
everywhere or is it nowhere i have no
idea what if someone who isn't
vaccinated walks into a place without a
mask on
should i trust them of course always
trust strangers
that's how i got now jay i hear that
baseball games and concerts are ramping
up again
will i have to wear a mask when i go by
myself to see billy joel
know if the concert is outdoors yes if
it's indoors
depending on the state some states
require masks and some don't
some states ask you to socially distance
indoors and others don't well jay what
about our most favorite place in the
world
the movie theater who cares in fact
reports show that the most socially
distant event of the entire pandemic
has been the new angelina jolie movie
you didn't even know there was one did
you ah well
thank god for netflix you want to watch
that new movie army of darkness
don't you mean land of the dead or
whatever
it's two and a half hours it's
all i need is some some time to pass
until i
get buried in the ground that's always
all i rather clip
mr ward how would you like to make
50 million dollars america's director
zack snyder is back and no it's not with
a heavily re-edited version of a film he
already shot
it's now a heavily re-edited version of
a film he already shot
why it's army of the dead everything's
come full circle for zach and the
zombies
going way back to his first big movie
the 2004 remake of dawn of the dead
although this time it's no longer
milwaukee in ruins
it's las vegas zombies have taken over
the city and a cracked team of
to go inside whatever kublai ammo
jay uh but how much
did you hate the film that i'm not just
gonna say what you think i just want to
know what like
on a scale of one to ten uh i didn't
hate it that much
i thought it was the most despicable
boring
filthy piece of trash i've ever seen hey
it's a pretty competent remake of aliens
i wanted to talk about that that's
that's i don't know if anyone else has
talked about that but that's i was
thinking that through the whole movie
it's like
it's like when a kid copies someone
else's homework and changes it just a
little bit
you know burke i don't know which
species is worse
you don't see them fucking each other
over for a goddamn percentage
at least within these walls the rules
are clear you don't see them fucking
each other over
okay it's a fun concept
and it's sporadically fun but it rarely
uh utilizes its premise in a way that's
satisfying
right because it's about these these
guys going into
uh young girls and gals going in
to to take money out of a safe
in zombie ridden las vegas and there's
one part when they're trying to get to
the safe and there's those things on the
floor that set off like traps
that are like security measures and they
send a zombie down the path to do it
instead to trigger off all the things
and like like darts go into his head and
they they
warm up a hand in a microwave so it's
like hot so
the zombie thinks it's you know still
alive because it has body heat
and that was the one scene was like okay
they're robbing a
a a safe in las vegas that's full of
zombies
that's the one scene that really
utilizes that
the only spark of cleverness in the
entire
film yeah see that that's that's the
thing is like
if you took two movie genres you take
say
the dawn of the dead the original dawn
of the dead from 1978
and you take something like ocean's
eleven obviously this reminds me a lot
of that because it's the exact same
premise
the crack team of people go to rob the
safe
at the bellagio i believe in the first
one um
i'm talking about the brad pitt george
clooney remake uh
and that's the premise but you you
vacuum out all the cleverness and then
you you remove all those the interesting
zombie elements from
the 1978 movie and you just make it a
dull like
shoot em up first person video game
shooter
that's that's another thing there's no
like there's no tension there's every
every shot they
they shoot hits a zombie in the head
yeah well you know all the human
characters are so stock yeah they try to
give a little bit to dave bautista
who i thought he was pretty good in this
he's very stoic but i didn't think he
was like wooden
um but they give him the the stock
father-daughter relationship that all
these type of movies have
um but i i liked him in the movie too so
that's another positive
where i did not like him in the movie oh
i don't know much about dave bautista i
know
he plays drax and uh guardians the
galaxy
i don't dislike dave bautista as a
person i just think he his performance
is kind of wooden he
works perfectly as drax oh sure that
he's never made him a joke he's never in
that joke it's very dry
although you could say zack snyder's
never in on the joke either
no they're yeah i don't know
the acting was like adequate and
everybody
else wasn't very good well except for
tigner taro and we'll talk about that
see i was going to say yeah we'll talk
about that
i guess if anyone doesn't know she
wasn't in the original shoot uh it was
chris delia
comedian that i had never heard of until
it came out that he was a sex pest
um sex best
um i
don't know any of the details uh i'm
vaguely aware of what happened with him
yeah we're not informed enough on the
guys we're not informed enough
the people involved with the movie
decided hey we want to distance
ourselves from him
they shot tignataro in front of a green
screen and replaced him for the whole
movie
so her performance comes across like
someone that was shot entirely in front
of a green screen
without any context as to what's
happening around her right
i hate my life so deeply if i had two
million dollars
my life would change drastically yeah
thank you yes
uh tig n taro is very funny i liked her
show it was called one mississippi i
i don't know if it's still i think they
stopped making it well
she walked away from it after because it
was produced by louis ck
so many sex pests yeah but that was a
good show she's funny her stand-up's
funny
uh but she's not a great actress in fact
it's almost like i don't know like she
just doesn't care
that's that's what makes it the best
part of the movie yeah that kind of
sarcastic performance
she's not good at acting but that's
what's great about it it's like
it almost feels like when i don't know
like they used to do this for the oscars
or the mtv movie awards you know what
i'm talking about
when they shoot the fake scene for like
a real movie and they put the comedian
in there but billy crystal they
superimpose him into the shot there's
something maybe something a little more
more contemporary jay than billy crystal
that's what i always think
yeah you know we'll say more modern
comedians
they put them into the shot and they
digitally put them in and they make the
lighting perfect and they cut them into
the scene
uh that's what every shot would take
notario in this felt like like a joke
yeah like she didn't belong in the movie
and that's what that was the best part
i take it back not zero
zero attributes um because she's just
like ah
well i'm gonna sit up here and i'm gonna
fly the helicopter what i don't know
what's going on and
and maybe she didn't oh what's going on
it's quite possible
hillary's back get behind the car go
behind the car
she was integrated pretty well though
never like because i kept looking at it
i kept getting distracted because i
wasn't engaged by the story
so i kept looking at her in the
background and like they they blended
her in pretty well there was a lot of
like if we're going to talk technical
stuff
the the lensing on this and the the the
depth of field was just like
yeah well that's i i i i saw because
zack snyder wrote this and going into
this is like oh zack snyder should never
write his movies
no the the few that he's written of his
are not
good the ones that he hasn't written
tend to be better like the original dawn
of the not the original but his dawn of
the dead was of course james gunn
so i saw that and then it said director
of photography zack snyder
and it's like has he ever done that
before as well so i looked up this is
the only feature that he's
the cinematographer for so now going
into movies
zack snyder should never write his own
movies and he should never be his own
cinematographer
because this entire movie has the the
shallowest depth of field
imaginable to the point where it's like
disorienting
and claustrophobic in a way that doesn't
work these canon
dream lenses that i got off of ebay it
was made i believe in the 1960s by a
japanese lensmaker
and then rebuilt them in these cinema
housings part of the thing i love about
them is there's a lot of flaws
in the dark scenes and the zombie scenes
it gives you this great quality where
unless it's right there and it's right
in front of you it gets mysterious and
creepy pretty quickly as things fall off
well it is the movie was shot digitally
i looked it up it's the first movie that
he's done that hasn't been shot on film
aside from the horrible justice league
ending the
post-apocalyptic nightmare world right
that was done digitally too
and that also looks like ass so
well i mean like yeah i i when i watch
these movies now i'm like okay
you know where's the where is the the
line where's the
worst of the green screen placed right
because obviously
it's all digital mad paintings it's not
just real they don't really destroy
las vegas casinos and create a destroyed
background
uh you know you got people walking
around and there's yeah there's a
car with some rocks on it yeah and then
everything and there's
like a street light and then they pan
the camera up i'm like all right right
there that's where they put this little
little green screen and then everything
else just yeah which is which is how
they make movies now i get that they're
not going to build these gigantic sets
but
i just think i think that's where my
brain goes when i get bored
i just start to deconstruct the visual
of the film i'm like
okay you know this is a set this part's
real this part's not this person's
really
there they shot this later yeah and it
just all looked like
it just looked like a big cheap movie
that's what i wanted to say is that the
the shallow depth of field makes the
whole thing look cheap
in a way that i'm sure it wasn't
intended to it looks like if you've ever
watched
like tech reviews on youtube like when
people review like a new camera
or a new lens and they shoot their like
test footage
where they shoot like a duck and a pond
and they have the the depth of field as
shallow as possible to show what the
camera bullet camera is capable of
this whole movie looked like that it it
just looked like they were trying to
like
fix everything possible so maybe he did
a really bad job with the
the lensing of the movie his first uh
digital cinematography
yeah yeah he just like screwed it up i
mean zack snyder's a
competent technical filmmaker regardless
of how you feel about his movies which
is why
the decision to do that is so baffling
you know how like a really clever
low budget filmmaker can who knows
just a ton about computers can really
stretch it
sure that's what this felt like to be
with the muzzle the digital muzzle
flares
i was thinking like really good fan film
when you see like yeah
not like an old shitty fan film but like
the more recent ones that people do yeah
right it felt like that
right where someone can really do
computer vfx stuff
really well and they shoot the whole
movie in their garage on a green screen
and it doesn't look like shit
they they they're able to incorporate the actors into digital environments and make it look really good
um
but you know some parts don't quite you
know
blur them out a little around and that
just kept sticking out
to me because i wasn't um engaged in the
story
i'm just being honest i'm just giving
myself i would hope so well
i don't dislike the man zack snyder i
don't i'm not
hating on him because everyone's going
to say that
we're just we're looking at the movie
and i'm
saying the movie the script is terrible
i would say the script is competent but
it's never engaged it's it's
it lacks it's it's such a great
like it's a fun premise
i was disappointed we have the opening
credit montage
showing the zombies taking over and you
know the city turned into chaos like i
wanted that to be the movie
yeah zombies invading las vegas but it's
just a quick montage at the beginning
and then everything is
post that and it almost doesn't even
matter that it's in las vegas because
they utilize it so little
there's like a big shootout in a casino
near the end
and they're obviously robbing the safe
that's underneath the casino but that
doesn't even have to be a casino
story-wise there's so little about it
being in vegas that matters
right right yes exactly um it the the
fall
of las vegas would have been the fun
part but that would have probably upped
the budget
yeah a 150 million dollars i looked up
the budget it's like 90 million
which is pretty pretty for a movie like
this yeah this movie should be called
army of the dead pixel
let's talk about that
the unfortunate thing is i can't
visually represent this very well i put
the movie into my editing timeline
but that version of the movie is is
already compressed
so it doesn't show up as well but trust
us
watch this on a 4k tv you'll see the
goddamn dead pixel
i wrote down the scenes i saw it in two
it's there they must have shot this
i thought so first i thought it was my
tv i was like there's a fucking--
i've never seen a dead pixel in a big
mainstream movie like this
so i did some looking around on other
things on netflix it wasn't there
so it's this movie and it'll cut to
another shot and it won't be there right
so they must have shot it on more than
one camera right um which makes sense
okay so when they're talking to the safe
guy and the safe guys like i need 30
minutes
you know like do you know what kind of
safe this is if if i fuck up one more time the safe will lock forever
blah blah blah blah
and i keep cutting through and there's a
couple different cameras that are
running yeah
and then some other scenes happen and
eventually we cut back and he's
listening and he's turning the
the and that's when you see it again
yeah so it's clearly
they shot all those scenes for the safe
yeah they filmed all those scenes
together with a couple of different
cameras and the one camera had a dead
pixel in it
microscopic white dot but in a dark
dingy
ugly movie well that's why the first
time i saw it was the the aliens
scene where they're putting down the
glow sticks you know and there's like
the aliens on each side of them
yeah that's the first time i noticed it
and that's when i was like am i going
crazy
so i noticed it there but then it would
cut to a different shot and it wasn't
there so like okay that must be the
other camera
yes and then that's the interesting
thing is i
i it is a camera issue yes
i thought maybe it's some kind of weird
process that happened
when they encoded it for netflix that's
well that was my first thought but then
when it's cutting between shots and it's
there and it's not there
and and it must be because what an easy
fix
in the editing bay is like okay i gotta
paint that one pixel
yeah i'm the whole movie
ever is rotoscoped around every
character
i i i have 11 to 20 shots
from a specific camera where there's a
dead pixel there's a couple of them
there's one main one that's there every
time that
camera is used but then there's a couple
more on each side of it there's like two
or three more
but there's one main one part of the
thing i love about him is there's a lot
of flaws
the premise real quick right um
the movie opens with an annoying
sequence with bad dialogue that goes on
for
for way too long for a setup right a guy
and a gal have gotten married in las
vegas the big cliche
they're leaving vegas and she wants to
give him what is called
road head
and this this was originally a scene
with james franco um but he was recast
and they digitally replaced him with
this other guy oh okay
um and uh is that funny
does anyone get that joke everyone's
already forgot about james franco
he won he went back to us i don't know
listen listen here jay i'm listening uh
and so then you cut back we're cutting
back and forth back and forth between
them and then this
this military convoy and you're just
like okay get to it yeah yeah yeah
and they're but when they're having
dialogue clever
dialogue back and forth before that what
if the thing we're carrying in the back
of our truck is
you know what why we need all this
firepower to protect it
could be anything from a briefcase nuke
to the original copy of the constitution
movie we're coming from area 51 you know
no i don't what are you talking about
seeing as we're just coming from uh
well you know so saying there's a chance
chance of what
chance we're hauling a well you know
yeah
it just keeps going and the performances
are bad too it's not just the dialogue
but uh they crash the car the cars crash
the the little truck cargo thing falls
over and then for no reason at all the
door latches open
and then it came loose in the the phone
and the guy's on the phone
he's like hey what's going on what
should we do or the cargo has been open
and she goes
oh get the fuck out of there
something
now close close the door
close the goddamn door
"all right close the fucking doors"
"will you close the fucking doors
where's cameron mitchell
close the fucking door
he's never there when you need him
"close that fucking door"
"tight"
"assholes"
uh whoever you are lady there's a lady
on the phone
and she he's like our car the cargo door
is it's not compromised completely it's
just the door open
oh and their convoy that's carrying this
thing is called the four horsemen
yes they get it i wrote that down in my
notes four horsemen and then they look
right at the cameras
bring in the apocalypse that's a deep
cut reference jay that nobody knows
the bible it's a deep cut nobody's ever
heard of the four horsemen of the
apocalypse
that's why it's so clever don't don't
call your secret military convoy the
four horsemen that's like calling your
uh
this is operation pandora's box
everybody
who wants to join up um don't call it
that
and so the the the premise which we
discover later in the film
is and i kid you not it's taken with all
seriousness
the government and or the private
sector military operations
wants to create a zombie
army
the old cliche we can use that monster
as a weapon hence your aliens we have
our paul reiser characters in this movie
not on the film but there's a guy who is
paul ryser yes
open this door
hey what are you doing i was very
briefly hoping for some sort of
subversion
where because they they're going into
the city with him with that guy
in their group and they're like you know
that guy he's going to betray us
we should just fucking kill him
i wish they would have if they because
he's so obviously going to
be the paul ryzer like if they just shot
him or something
that would have been fun well that's
like the the the
for introduction to tig notaro's
character you always have that scene at
the beginning of the movies where you
get the
the group together and you got to
convince them like i'm not going back
there man
but they go to take notaro she's like
yeah sure i'll do it for money and then
she just awkwardly walks away
we are putting together a crew for a job
yeah what does it pay
we make two million dollars for one
day's work two million dollars
what that's my share that's just for me
100
i'm in yeah you don't want to know you
know the risks or why would i want to
know the risks
like that was amusing that that scene
worked and so i was hoping there'd be
maybe a little bit more of that type of
stuff
that's what i mean is like a
very bad predictable script and
like lazy
sloppy and just bad all around it just
it wanted to be clever and it just
wasn't
yeah and and it had it had the the
perfect groundwork
for a fun clever movie about zombies
yeah in las vegas i mean
when i compared the two movies 1978's
dawn of the dead and ocean's 11. i kind
of feel like and
we'll say aliens
so it's these three films right 1978
dawn of the dead
that's a movie that is about a lot of
other things other than the zombies
right and and to me the fun part of that
movie is uh
it's a procedural movie kind of like oh
yeah we did a whole review about that
yeah it's um it's you know not focused
on the zombies of course they're in it
but
it's like what what if you're in a
zombie apocalypse
and you hole up in a shopping mall what
do you do well you block the entrances
you got to make sure you got food you
got to
go through all these steps and the movie
just goes through that in like
painstaking detail and almost like
real time yeah and that's the fun part
about that movie and then you got
something like ocean's 11 where you have
this crack team where everybody has
their specialty
and they all have to perform a job and
all these things go wrong
and they have to they have to um pivot
along the way
and and react right and this had those
but
neither of them it was just a dumb blunt
movie where none of the characters were
clever and they all had that kind of
annoying quality to them where they they
needed to give them a gimmick
like the safe cracker guy when the uh
spoilers
but at the very end of the movie we have
the the heartfelt emotional scene
between dave bautista and his daughter
they've reunited they've reconnected and
now she has to put him down because he's
turned into a zombie and that happens
and it's like oh good the movie's over
but then other guy on their team comes
out
with all the money they got put in the
safe legitimately for a moment i was
like
who i forgot about that guy entirely
because he has no personality
uh i did not forget about that guy
because i remember that scene i'm
assuming
that whole ending much like the the zack
snyder justice league ending and it's
just like self-indulgent like set up for
another movie clearly it's like set up
for a sequel yeah yeah
i mean you can have those endings to
movies where they're not really set up
for a sequel but they do have that like
oh this is going to keep going
this just felt like blunt we're going to
make another one
it's not over yet kids maybe maybe but
yeah and then that's the stupid
ticking clock element in the plot is
they're going to nuke
las vegas i i was fine with them having
that it's something
yeah but it was like once the premise
fell apart
they're not getting the money now it's
just then it just kind of devolves into
survival it's like aliens yeah
where it's like newt and
and ripley or dave batista and his
daughter they even go up on a rooftop
they even have a character uh blow
himself up to to save everybody
else yeah and uh they think when they
think bishop
left them bishop god damn you
bishop
would it have been too obvious that he
was ripping off aliens
if that monster man like appeared on the
roof
well he did appear on the roof no he did
but before the helicopter is revealed
they come out of the roof and they stand
around and then they hear
the chopper blades and then the
helicopter comes up and they're like oh
she didn't
that was an unintentional laughter up on
the roof and it's dead silent
wait you guys you guys hear that
and then she says do you hear something
and then immediately like if the pla if
the the
helicopter was right below the top of
the
building you'd hear it you could hear a
trapper from like
60 miles away but it's dead i know
that's a movie thing
but it was at that point in the movie it
made me laugh it wasn't a surprise
like the silent space spaceship that
bishop was flying
but that was the thing it's like that's
tension as ripley and
and newt make it out onto the roof and
bishop has left
and there's also going to be a nuclear
explosion um
and then the queen alien comes out of
the door
queen alien is a little more she says
awesome and intimidating than the
zombie king in this movie she says close
your eyes
baby because they're about to get mauled the fuck up by the queen alien
and then here comes here comes bishop oh my god
he didn't leave
attention release
but the tig is not there two seconds
later she's there oh she's there
then can we call him conan the zombarian
and and his uh his his lady friend she-roar
was she supposed to be dressed like a like a um like a showgirl
what was what the fuck was she wearing
i don't know i think it was just
supposed to be like evoke the feeling of
like an amazonian queen
but yeah some sort of royalty but she's
a zombie but it would make sense if
she was dressed like extravagantly yeah
flamboyantly like she had the tierra
well again we see topless showgirls
zombies at the beginning of the movie
that's true we do during the opening
credits sequence which is the fun las
vegas stuff that they banded for the
rest of the movie
yeah so mars attacks now that's a fun
las vegas oh yeah they really utilize
vegas in that
and washington dc they utilize all sorts
of cities in that movie
right right the part when they knock
over the washington monument
and they're like moving it around to
make sure it lands on people yes yes
that's good stuff right
many many many many
many scenes felt way too long oh yeah
uh there's no reason for this movie to
be two and a half hours i could
highlight one specific moment
when paul reiser's character aka man
with sunglasses working for the bad guy
gets his comeuppance as he should
um when he does everything that paul reiser did in aliens
lock everybody out
he literally locks the door on ripley
yeah
and everybody
"let us out of here"
"open it"
then gets fucking killed by an alien right
how did they how did james cameron shoot that
alien sneaks up behind him
aww, here comes thing
done
yeah
what happens to this guy jay
"dammit"
uh
all we needed was oh yeah it goes on
forever all we needed was
done yeah you know the conclusion yeah
you know he's gonna get it from that
tiger that he
he expressed dismay for earlier on in
the film don't you think that scene with
paul ryser would have been better though
if we
we saw his his head fall apart for five
minutes in the shot
eleven minutes of struggle eleven
minutes of struggling
sure and fighting the alien back and
forth
his scratches on no reason
other than zack snyder thought it looked cool
that's that's all the things
there's a lot of things wrong with this movie
"holy shit are you kidding me"
"it really scared me"
"you really scared me you shithead"
"you gonna help me up or what"
uh okay this is where it gets kind of
weird confusing vegas
is a zombieland yes they surround it
with shipping containers to contain all
the zombies right
and it's a big debate in washington d.c
and what we should do
they build a wall they build a wall this
is an attempted social commentator and
there is a there is like a
kids in camp yeah yeah a a
detainment camp um it's not so much
social commentary as it is
zack snyder's saying these are things
that happen in the world
and this is a thing that happened in the
world i saw it on the news
basic people are held as prisoners
because they were too close to the
zombie action and they may have be
infected
yeah oh that's another current event
thing is they they uh
do the right uh whatchamacallit to their
heads detect their temperature
and poor old me thought there would be a
clever twist with that
i got to check your temperature yeah
okay you took my temperature pitch what
what oh i wasn't holding the temperature
gun
you know clear setup for some kind of
switcheroo whether it was clever or an
accident you know whatever
clear setup for that didn't happen uh
and so
dave bautista's daughter is not a a
person being held at the camp she's a
volunteer
and she befriends a lady
and her daughter and
blonde lady um she's almost like a
coyote
she uh smuggles people yeah out of the
camp
through the city and then they end up
being captured
by conan the zombarian for what reason
they are held in the penthouse suite
why do they kill and eat some people but
hold some hostage
what do they have to gain from having
hostages
my initial suspicions were perhaps
which would make sense and i don't know
if this is in the film at all or implied
whatsoever or even thought of but
uh they would steal women
of childbearing age so that they could
make
more zombie army babies well that's
pretty gross
but make more zombie army for what
purpose what is the goal of this
army this titular army of the dead it's
an it's an
army that's going to take over the world
even though they've never explicitly
said that that's their goal
okay and they don't seem to have the
intelligence
to formulate that kind of plan yeah they
probably don't even know what
exists outside of the shipping
containers
uh so case in point uh dave bautista's
daughter wants to join the mercenary
crew
hired by businessman to go get the money
because
she wants to get in there to find her
friend yeah
and then dave batista says no you're not
going and she says
yes i am and he says okay i'm going in
either way
and i'll probably die some of these
people are gonna die
this is life and death like a remember
the ripley's daughter subplot
that's why she gravitated towards newt
yeah i think i think there was a
i think there's an algorithm or a
template
zack snyder used to write this script
yeah it's called the alien script
"you don't see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage"
"you don't see them fucking each other over"
i mean there's a couple of referees
there's a star wars reference i don't
know if you caught it
oh well the sound effects
yeah the classic lucasfilm sound effects
but what does
taro say when she walks out onto the
roof and sees the helicopter
what a hunk of junk what a piece of junk
can we get a tig nutaro movie vehicle
sure just called sigmataro dignitaro
does stuff what if she replaced david
batista in this movie
what if she played the lead i would love
it zack snyder would never do that
because
he loves his his buff dudes but
getting to take the taro the lead in a
movie like this that alone would change
the entire dynamic
okay so you have taken the tarot right
and uh
she she's just like oh god oh
god of my house it's being foreclosed on
and yeah she's trying to run a mechanic
shop she's
she's a helicopter pilot we'll keep her
the same character sure
and then she gets this offer and and
it's
it's going to be very dangerous but
there's 200 million dollars in this safe
ah all right she has zero
zero interest the the bill murray
ghostbusters effects
yes yes kind of distant from the
material distant from
from everything that's going on and
she's she's kind of half-heartedly like
recruiting people and like most of them
just
just say no all right all right i'll try
again next week but if i if you don't
answer that
that means uh that that's a firm now if
you don't answer
all right see you later it's a scene
after scene for just showing up to
people
how much money uh a lot
there's gonna be zombies everywhere
and then it just that's just her going
in by yourself
yeah that just sets up yeah maybe i know
no one shows up to the rallying point
and then i
can just picture it going ah i guess i
gotta do it myself
and then that's the whole movie
two things i've noticed small things
that i noticed
when they open up the vault the money
vault there's a ton of film canisters
reference to something
i don't know what is that a reference to
i don't know oh i think maybe it's a
print print the reels from
dawn of the dead that or what if it's
depending on when this was shot if this
was made before the whole justice league
snyder cut happened what if that was an
inside little joke like there's the
snyder cut
and then also i noticed i don't know if
it's a mistake
but probably should have been a retake
or
maybe they used a bad take this is how
broad it was
there's a shot where they open up a door
to go
i think it's when they go into the safe
and dave bautista holds up his
flashlight and it's on
and then he turns it off and then he
goes
back and turns it back on the actor
didn't know if it was on or not
he realized it was on oh it's supposed
to be off here and then it's supposed to
be off
and then i turn it on but he lifted it
up and it was on like they had done
multiple takes
and it was in the off on off on kind of
situation huh
in the take i think i think the editor
was asleep at the wheel
and let
mistakes actors make what a piece of
junk
i noticed details jay that's that's well
that's that's what you start to focus on
when you're not engaged by a story
right yeah well none of these things
matter if it's a if it's a good movie
and a good story that you're interested
in
for 30 years i never noticed that
stormtrooper bumped his head on the top
of the door because
my thought was oh no r2d2 and c3po the
stormtroopers are coming inside or the
or the little kid pointing at his crotch
at the
back of the future three right i didn't
know that existed till the internet
because you're you're watching doc brown
yeah and this is the conclusion to their
story doc brown is a time-traveling
locomotive
and he's there with mary steenburgen and
they have two little boys look at this
wow
i'm so excited i'm so happy it's the
magic of movies
and meanwhile a six-year-old is just
displaying that as junk
and going like this has anyone tracked
that kid down
and like asked him about that now as an
adult i don't know what the hell is that
i i really don't know but uh yeah i
think this this movie felt sloppy it
felt
kind of cheap uh and it
lacks fun it likes cleverness it lacks
excitement
it lacks interest relax connection with
any character
uh at least it's not overly like
annoying no that's why at the beginning
i said i didn't hate it like i thought
it was
completely watchable because yeah it
wasn't like
irritating to sit through yeah nobody
was obnoxious or cringy
yeah the safe cracker guy was i don't
know there was like
sort of cringy stuff he was screaming
like a girl and
he was a little kind of an annoying
character
so mike would you recommend army of the
dead pixels
nope don't watch any movies
maybe watch that angelina jolie movie so
they can make some of their money back
i don't know i don't know why do you
feel bad for them i don't know who made
that movie
they're probably a pervert
sex pest they're probably a sex pest i
don't know i don't know
no this this is overly long
that's why i would say if you're gonna
watch it if you have netflix just watch
up to well watch the opening credit
sequence because that's the fun vegas
stuff
and then watch the first tignataro scene
and just assume
just stop it there and just be like oh
that's the end of the movie
yeah take notaro saying yeah sure i'll
do it
awkwardly and then on her green screen
walking away
and that's the end of the movie now do
you think if they had filled in all
those pixels it would be a better movie
because we are missing some
some of the film that's true we're
missing 0.02
of the film oh well i throw a couple
more
zeros in there maybe maybe about 700
zeros
but but just the thought you know hey if
we could we could have missed some very
important information in that pixel
there is literally information missing
in the film yeah so it had we filled it
there was a clever plot twist in that
pixel we didn't see it there are some
jokes
some character development all in those
pixels a whole james gun script was in
there yeah and we'll never see it now
because of that through those pixels
that that dead pixel that i guess nobody
noticed
do you think zang snyder is a fan of
swiss cheese
this cameraman is
that's not funny at all
