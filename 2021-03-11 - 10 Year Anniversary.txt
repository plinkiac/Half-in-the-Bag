half in the bag
i'm gonna sit in my favorite chair
oh gotta get over there somehow
oh my god
oh hello
goodbye
oh how do i do that 10 to 15 times a day
oh hi mr plinkett don't hide me
i had to go to the doctor's today he put
his
fingers everywhere my ears my
eyes my mouth my rectum
i just wish he changed his gloves
well did he at least end with the rectum
now if you'll excuse me i've got to go
wash my mouth out
with lie
should we just sit down and get to work
sure why not yeah
oh my god mike you know what i just
realized what's that jay
we've been working on mr plinkett's vcr
for 10
years now what really yeah we first
started this gig on march 11
2011. but boy did we sure have some
crazy adventures though
that's right mike but the one thing we
haven't earned is money
or respect but hey at least we haven't made any
just like that baby
good go wait in the car
and keep it running this isn't marin
county
george lucas i thought he was dead
nope not dead still here in fact
i sold star wars to disney because of
you two frauds
what why your silly reviews of my
prequel films caused me to get bullied
on the internet
so much in fact that i decided [ __ ] it
i'm selling star wars to the shittiest
company
on earth wait why is that our fault
listen buddy when the 17 494th most
subscribed to youtube channel mocks your
billion-dollar blockbuster franchise
well well we'll just see how how you
feel about it
oh
look mr lucas why don't you grab a seat
we'll talk about this okay
yeah sure why not [ __ ] my life
ah
uh here mr lucas why don't you have a
beer
thanks melody won't let me drink around
the wookies
look mr lucas i think we all know that
after revenge of the sith
you were done directing star wars films
yeah i mean you did
your best i know
i know and it was hard
cashing that four billion dollar check
but
disney was the only one with enough cash
to buy star wars
i suppose i could have sold it to some
plucky young filmmaker
someone who cared about star wars and
didn't just see it as a commodity
a young filmmaker from modesto with a
dream like me
maybe i'll finally get around to making
my small personal films
hey i know what would cheer you up yeah
um let me let you in on a little secret
yeah yeah yeah when jay and i aren't
working as vcr repairmen
we do a little internet show called best
of the worst
hmm i'm intrigued tell me more of this
best of worst we discovered long ago
that it's much easier to laugh at others
failing than to actually try yourself
like when stephen made hook exactly
that was pretty funny yeah so let go of
that awful feeling that your magical
space adventure series that delighted
audiences worldwide has turned into an
unimaginative product produced by a
soulless corporation that's been swept
up into an endlessly nasty and toxic
political internet subculture
you know what i'm saying what yeah i'm
70 something years old now and
i deserve a beer i deserve some red meat
i deserve to have some fun right
for once let someone else be the butt of
the joke yeah
now come on george let's go watch some
movies
yeah and i know a perfect movie we could
start with
hey hey that's my footage nobody told me
about this
what the [ __ ] i'm delightful
now these are villains and that is
drawing
not macquarie i got nothing on this
production design
sarcasm i love it hasn't been sarcastic
i don't know
what the [ __ ] is this what what the [ __ ]
is going on
what is this i've got a kung fu movie
now i didn't i didn't put kung fu in
star wars
wait a minute oh i know this music
what's this from
it's this uh oh it's from a movie i know
i can't i can't place it is this this is
from
this from one of francis's films right
do you want me to look it up no no i
gotta give me a minute give me a minute
oh that looks so stupid
doesn't make any sense
this is this is kind of fun i like this
