half in the bag
uh so jay what else did you see
i'm thinking of ending things
what we just started this vcr repair shop business 14 years ago
how could you
how am i ever going to find another person equally qualified to fix and or repair vcrs as good as you, jay
i better start going to monster.com to look for applicants
vcr repair i guess i should write
person and not be sexist person
zero results hmm i guess i'll go to
linkedin
linked in vcr
repair person
zero results oh no mike i was talking
about the motion picture i'm thinking of
ending things
oh right also i want to kill myself
i've never experienced anything like it
i'm thinking of ending things huh what
did you say something
i don't think so well i saw him thinking
of ending things too
we both saw this film it was a netflix
film should have been on the big screen
let's see that that four by three
glorious glory
it's just like seeing a christopher
nolan film i like that four by three is
come back for certain movies there's
some films where it really works where
it feels like claustrophobic and
and appropriate a ghost story and this
is a ghost story it was another one and
this is one where
i think it definitely benefits from from
that look uh i liked this movie a lot
i did too um it needs a second
third and a fourth rewatch but i really
liked it it's it's a little frustrating
i think you would said at one point that
charlie kaufman is a little too smart
for his own good too smart for his
audience
yeah well for his own good i mean this
is a movie that almost demands
homework from you after you watch it you
got to do some reading up because it's
tons and tons of literary references and
theater references and movie references
that aren't
making you aware that they're references
you either know what they're talking
about or you don't
yeah and you either understand why
they're talking about it or you don't
it's it's a lot it's a lot to process um
but just as like a surreal story about
a man's relationship falling apart
uh you know it works that way even
though that's not really what it's about
but while you're watching it uh the the
tension of
them being in the house with the parents
like you understand the emotions of it
even if you don't understand
logistically what's happening yeah i
mean
it's the trailer of course is misleading
because most people won't like this
movie
yes i'm sure i haven't looked it up but
i'm sure it has a you know
tons of zero stars it's one of those
yeah zero stars or ten stars
probably it was brilliant it's brilliant
this is the worst thing i've ever seen
because it has has that sheen of a
semi-narrative going over it and it has
a unreliable narrator issue yes um
which you know throws you off balance
because it's
it's
it's a movie about an old janitor
um and it's so pathetic that when he
fantasizes about
his ideal life the girl in that fantasy
still wants to leave him
spoilers yes she it's you get inside her
head
you hear her thoughts yes and you're
like okay here's our
narrator here's our protagonist and she
doesn't exist
and um and so it's [ __ ] up and yet she
has more
character in humanity than he does yeah
he's very misanthropic which is pretty
typical for charlie kaufman
yes he he's he's pathetic i can't
remember what he looks like
why would i it was just
just one of thousands of such
non-interactions
in my life i don't know how do you talk
about this movie without
encapsulating the whole thing well i
think explaining what it's about is
doing quite a bit because i'm sure
there's a lot of people that
get to the end and they're just
frustrated and angry yeah right right
but that's where the the references come
in because he's someone who's just
filled his empty life with media with
movies or
books so there's one part in the car
when he's getting into an argument with
her
they're talking about what's the movie
it's john cassavetes movie but she just
starts quoting
the pauline kale review yeah well
there's a polling kale book
yeah you see that later so yeah but if
you're watching this and she just starts
going into this voice you're like what's
like i said it requires homework
right which can be frustrating uh but i
i think enough at least for me enough of
the movie worked
even before kind of digging into the
things that i didn't quite connect with
i think it still works it's just a solid
kind of
moody creepy movie oh sure it's
interesting to watch um but but you know
your audience is going to want to grasp
on to a narrative
and and like and then when you get to
the house
and uh tony colette's there and she's
crazy
and tony klutz beca kind of reminded me
of judy greer where it's like it seems
like she's just in everything
yeah and and then all these just weird
like
bizarre things start happening there's
time skips
yeah and uh i thought the whole movie
was going to be in that house once i got
there
that was the impression i got that we're
just going to kind of see the passing of
time
and all these like uh you know time
glitches while they're in this house
so then like halfway through they leave
the house it's like oh now i have no
idea where we're going
it feels like a fever dream it's
claustrophobic it's it's
it's strange it's
it's almost impenetrable almost
impenetrable yes
it's it's not accessible to a
regular audience you have to really
think and then watching it again and
again probably would help out a lot
and the problem with that is that it's
such a depressing movie you're not going
to want to re-watch it anytime soon
right right but just to pick up on clues
and and then
it's a fun character study that that
almost
you don't see the character that it's
about
you see him in in a way that he's
imagining everything it's just
it's yeah it's good which girl there
were
several several or three severals
anything
more than two really look it up
look it up can you stop saying that that
guy that actor
in this uh what is his name jesse
plemons jesse plummons who's on breaking
bad
he i don't know if this is true but is
it was his
was he his backup for philip seymour
hoffman
who's dead oh because cause this is a
philip seymour hoffman role yeah
i mean philip seymour hoffman was in
schenectady new york yeah and that's a
charlie kaufman movie and
and it's just i know philip seymour
hoffman is dead so obviously he could
not play this part but
that jessie plymon's guy you know what
he's kind of doing
he ki he's kind of he's sumo hoffman
probably would have been a little too
old for the role
unless you upped the age of the the girl
but um it just kind of feels like that's
the kind of guy
he wants like you know it's like the
woody allen
stand-in and woody allen movies like oh
yeah jesse fleming's kind of reminds me
of like
i want phillip seymour hoffman oh you
still can't see that i want him someone
who's like him kind of
running mumbles but yeah
good movie uh hard to recommend because
it's gonna often be off-putting to a lot
of people
but again with your point of
how how many milliseconds
would this movie have died in a movie
theater
the the they would have hit play on the
movie and the
theater would have collapsed the
poltergeist house
that theater no longer exists
we played the new charlie coffman
so i talked about uncle frank from uh
written and directed by alan ball
who's done other stuff and this sort of
feels like a
little watered down version of his usual
material
i watched on the rocks did you watch on
the rocks i did not
bill murray and uh ann perkins
yeah jones i was mildly curious
about it for about five seconds and then
i forgot completely about it
oh my gosh do you look beautiful you
live how's your mom's hip
good thanks good he thinks you're my
girlfriend grace
um but yeah on the rocks bill murray
directed by sofia
and then uh of course bill murray was in
lost in translation sophia coppola's big
breakout hit
the only movie of hers that i like yes
which is why i was curious about this
one
because of bill murray and then you want
to talk about watering down
on the rocks
it happened it is it is uh
it is white toast
uh so the premise of the movie is uh
rashida jones is married to marlon
wayans
but he's off doing some kind of like
tech work he's a computer
uh the silicon valley guy and they're
doing a startup
and you know kind of thing and he's
always flying around on business trips
and there's this lady that is always
around him and he's like oh it's you
know
it's what's her face she's yeah we're
buddies you know
and then they find out like oh she found
some of her [ __ ] in his in his
luggage so she starts to suspect an
affair
and um she
uh you know she's getting kind of clues
about that and so then bill murray shows
up who's her father
and he's an old-time old-time playboy
womanizer kind of character who divorced
the mother and
he kind of says like sleazy advice he's
hitting on waitresses
he then um kind of weasels his way into
her life and says i'm gonna help you
find out if this guy's cheating
she shows up in his little sports car
and they go driving around they follow
him and
um i thought that it was going to be
like them
bonding that's what i assumed it was
like a yeah
father-daughter reconnecting a little
bit
and then
uh she kind of finds out that he wasn't
cheating
and then it ends oh
the guy she thought her husband was
gonna be the sleazy guy but it turns out
he's
completely faithful and sort of like a
changing of the guard the old ways of
the old
old crusty white guys who sleep around
dad was a womanizer so maybe my
husband's a womanizer but yeah
my husband's not a womanizer so there's
no drama or attention yes
sounds great i think rich said this
talking about the last jedi where he's
like
i like i like twists and movies that
make the story less interesting
it's weird that bill murray would be
playing that like he used to be like a
womanizer because there was this
character in
broken flowers mm-hmm much better film
but that's
and there's kind of that part of the
humor is the contrast of he's
pathetic sad looking bill murray but
everyone talks about him like he used to
be this playboy and there's that
incongruity
which is where the humor comes from but
in this it sounds like it's just
he just straight up was a womanizer and
well it's weird for bill murray
it's not like overt like he's not like a
sleazy womanizer
okay he's he's very rich
like he has a driver and he has sports
cars and
i don't know if it says like
and there's no like remorse or regret
he's just is who he is
and then he's just wrong about
suspecting the husband being
being a cheater i mean that's that's
kind of all her things they're
no real drama just kind of loosey-goosey
flailing around not much happens it
works in lost in translation because
those characters are so strong
and their their kind of connection is
strong but that's why i don't like any
of our other movies because it's just
like
a whole lot of nothing and not a lot to
latch on to what other sofia coppola
movies have i seen
i don't know which ones you've seen
she's a diversion suicide
she do 28 days later she did 28 weeks
later
yeah yeah she did 300 and batman for
superman
resident evil she did resident evil
resident evil apocalypse
not apocalypse she did a resident evil
afterlife okay okay
[Music]
thank you i'm gonna take that as a
compliment are there two
speaking of things that happened in her
bland i saw
the new mutants it happens
but this it's hard to believe this was
meant to be a theatrical film
because it really feels like the first
episode of a tv show
because nothing happens and you're like
oh we're just setting up all of our
characters for future episodes
but it's just a movie and they realize
nothing happens because then you get to
the end and they just fight a giant
monster
we've had them sit around this this this
mental hospital or whatever it's
supposed to be this research hospital
for
the entire movie doing nothing i guess
they fight a monster at the end
welcome to comic book movies i suppose
no this is like
bottom of the barrel as far as story
goes like for a comic book movie
i know you have to have something big
happen at the end of your comic book
movie but you usually have good
character stuff throughout leading up to
it
yeah well it takes place in this
hospital
they're the only like patients in the
hospital it's like whatever five of them
six of them
and there's one employee she's the only
one in the hospital there's nobody in
this [ __ ] movie it's so weird
i know they set up in the trailer that
on anna taylor joy
she's like i killed 19 men yeah
does she turn out to be like a bad guy
no
she just does a bad russian accent
there's so many bad accents in this
movie too i think she's a really good
actress i think she's really interested
i'll talk about her in the queen's
gambit in a minute but
bad accent in this movie the stranger
things kid is doing like a southern
accent
sounds laughable everybody it's like
career worst performances from all these
people
and they're just kind of sitting around
i'm surprised it wasn't directed by
sophia coppola because nothing happens
oh
did you just make an x-men live-action
tv show
sure like just [ __ ] it scrap everything
and start from the beginning
because you said it looks like a tv show
tv shows
look as good as movies now yeah like
[ __ ] it tv shows look better than this
movie
who owns x-men paramount or 20th century
no no it's it's fox which is disney
but yeah i mean especially if the
theater format is
sort of going away well yeah i mean a
movie like this doesn't help like this
movie wasn't going to bring people back
to the theaters
a bunch of [ __ ] boring kids sitting
around in a room for 90 minutes and then
they fight a bear
wow great film
[Music]
[Applause]
a quick shout out to a very very very
short
little tv series i watched uh which was
on show time
i think i said showtime was all trash
you did it's not all trash uh it's the
recorded record of you saying it
uh oh god the worst i think is show time
the worst i think is show time
oh yeah there is it's called moon base
eight i just got a lot on the line here
i mean i screwed up my whole life that's
why i need to get to the moon
i go up to the moon i'm a hero tim
heidecker
fred armisen and john c reilly and
they're schlubs who
uh live in a moon base not on the moon
in the desert in arizona it's a testing
site
for them eventually to go to the moon
sandy realized i think i saw the trailer
i didn't realize they were just on earth
yeah
that makes the whole thing much funnier
it is
um because it's just like all the things
they encounter
are things that would just never happen
on the moon i mean there's a cattle
drive
that has to come by
ranchers tell them to like um they got
to move their base because their cattle
drive's coming through so they figure
out a way to use like
little nasa rockets to like distract the
cows from hitting their moon base
and then there's like a like like a
homeless junker who keeps stealing their
stuff
the problems they would incur would not
happen on the moon
it makes no sense okay makes no sense
but it's fun that's great and they're
mostly ad-libbing i think
launch sequence beginning in nine eight
nine seven eight six
five standby let's sync up four aboard
it's just very loose and you know fred
armisen as being
fred armisen saying weird things and
john c reilly is like he's like pathetic
he's like um he's uh oh god he
he ran a helicopter tourism
company in uh hawaii and he went
bankrupt
so this is like his way of like like
showing his family that
he could do something go on the moon
and uh tim hineker is like a religious
christian
and he like skypes with his family and
he has like 19 kids
and his wife is like like sleeping with
the pastor of their church
clearly and then fred armisen is uh
he's living in the shadow of his
successful father
who was like a nasa scientist who worked
on the apollo missions
he's also smart he's a doctor um but
he's
he's just doing this like he's he's
working below his
his intelligence level and so the three
of them live and they have these little
bunks that are like right next to each
other like these
like like like closet doors it's
there's just like crappy sets um
it's not like it's it's just so like
loose and fun and it's not like overly
like
scripted joke here joke here joke here
it's just sort of like
just seems like they're having fun does
it have a an ending is it does it feel
like a limited series or does it feel
like the first season of a series
it feels like it ends on i wouldn't call
it a cliffhanger but
um every every time they they get a
communication from nasa
it's like um oh it has those computer
sound effects that we use like
oh
so it comes on a computer screen and
it's like the siri voice
today your assignment will be so it's
questionable whether or not they're
actually working for nasa or not
at the end they show them like uh
there's somebody watching them
through like screens and then it cuts
away okay so they may not actually be
working for nasa
so there's a lead-in too it could be
more all right yeah it's fun goofy
nonsense
yeah but it's not too goofy it's like
right on that borderline
of i mean it crosses over the line but
it's like is
should i are they taking it seriously
should i take this
at all seriously it's not like like
crazy uh
it's grounded sort of
speaking of shorts series you said your
show is only six or eight episodes or
whatever i watched
the queen's gambit which did not seem
like the kind of thing i would be
interested at all but people kept
recommending it to me
i don't give a [ __ ] about chess uh but
it's very very good
tell the readers of life how it feels
and to be a girl
among all those men i don't mind it
chess isn't always competitive do you
even know how to play chess i absolutely
do not and watching this entire series i
didn't figure it out
it's not really about chess it's like a
sports movie it's like rocky isn't
really
about boxing it's about rocky and this
is like that too it's based on a book
it was apparently supposed to be adapted
in like the early 2000s directed by
heath ledger but then he passed away and
so that obviously didn't
kind of fell apart but uh i think it
works better as a limited run series
than it would have as a two hour movie
because it really gives you time to
see your main character's backstory see
how she grew up see how she became the
person she became
why she has substance abuse problems
which is what she's trying to overcome
but there weren't any like female chess
players back then it was just like no
um and so when i watched the trailer i
was like
because it wasn't really a trailer it
was like that a scene you know
netflix pre-loads a little thing yeah
and it was her like signing up you know
are you sure you want to do this i'm
sure we don't have a women's section
i'll put you in beginners i'm not a
beginner and so i was like oh this is
cool is this
really happened is did some some girl
like
weasel her way into the high ranks of
the chess world in the 1960s and become
famous
and uh no and so like because i like
historical stuff i like true stories and
i was like oh
some sort of fictionalized no no it's
it's a scary story but it's it's well
done
it's it's got lots of really like like
swooping
shots like there's lots of because
you're kind of like she's an orphan her
mother died when she was really little
so she grew up in this orphanage and
so a lot of it is kind of told through
her eyes of like discovering the world
for the first time and
so you get like she goes to vegas and
it's like like cool retro 1960s vegas
and we get these sweeping shots of the
uh the hotel and she goes into it we go
up to the second floor
oh maybe i'll check it out i i think
it's worth it i run out of terrible
shows to watch
it's you know it goes by pretty quick
it's like eight episodes
and it has that that energy of a sports
movie but it's about
uh chess well you got to keep that
camera moving you got to keep things
exciting when you're dealing with chess
it's true it's true because people are
just sitting there and her performance
too she's you know so many like younger
actors they all kind of blend together
but there's something about her that
really
she's really distinct she really stands
out and she's this is probably her best
[Music]
performance
let's talk about our feature event this
is the grand finale everybody
grand finale of all the garbage
forget about the trash the only [ __ ]
movies i was actually
uh excited to see possessor
oh meow there were things i liked about
possessor but overall
i did not like it oh i found it uh
amateurish in nature really
and how old is brandon cronenberg
i don't know this is a second movie he
did a movie before this called
anti-viral
is he like 20 or something i mean he's
older than that
i don't know i don't know anything about
him i'm not a big david cronenberg
fan i know you like this weird stuff i'm
a big david cronenberg fan yes
i i like weird stuff too this this is
this
is hard to explain because it's writing
the line between
uh telling a narrative and bizarre
[ __ ] up
mind stuff they reminded me of of uh
the exorcist part two oh my god that's
so cool um in what way
that weird hospital where they're doing
like mental science fiction experiments
on
the possessed girl yeah i think it was
the retro
look of stuff too there's stylistically
this is a neat movie
um production production design wise
the the retro cars randomly um the the
1970s
like pro props the
the mask and the the actual flipping of
the switches and
it felt it it's a weird combination of
future and
because he the characters jobs they're
like data mining but it's not like a
computer program he's like
physically looking into people's houses
yeah and like
pointing out their drapes and stuff it's
really weird it's like they need
people to do that yeah they probably
don't it had that kind of like
i don't know uh thx or brazil or
this kind of weird creepy soulless like
company that you're working for where
you're just a cog in the machine
um and then you know outside of that he
lives in this really nice apartment
with his girlfriend who's the daughter
of the guy
and then our main character um i don't
know why i thought it was tilda swinton
you don't see her too much okay so it
has a
premise that feels kind of like a
christopher nolan movie
right you know i've watched it twice and
the second time i watched it i was
thinking of that
it's like like a perverted version of uh
that high concept christopher nolan
high concept like heist murder kind of
spy thing
well and definitely uh inception the way
you got to get like plugged in
matrix inception like mind bending
you're gonna i love the concept i love
the concept and i love the production
design
i thought it was a neat concept that
what didn't you because i liked all
those things too so i'm curious
what you didn't like i i didn't like i
would have liked it
if they had no plot
because okay so the opening scene
is uh a a girl is sticking
a thing in her head and then she stabs
a guy they set it up right perfectly and
the girl he stabs the guy and then
uh not tilted sweat swinton gets pulled
out of it and you're like oh okay she
was in her mind
she she was positive yes and it's this
whole like like
creepy evil
company that that hires people um
the lady we'll just call her tilda
swinton she
is very good at her job which is
she has a like a well-trained mind where
she can manage this i guess it's very
stressful on the brain
when you come out of it you're
disoriented and sick they do all these
tests to make sure your
your mind is back in order right um and
it can be a really
traumatic and tough experience to
possess another person which makes sense
and all that kind of science stuff in
the beginning was great
and it's basically like an assassin they
do it for that reason
yeah i could think of many other reasons
to do it
um other than just murder for higher
premises
it would be neat to possess like a
[ __ ] politician
and go up to a podium and just say all
sorts of crazy stuff
and throw off an election yeah you know
or i mean that might exist in this world
maybe it does that's kind of what i like
is the idea that you know there's a
larger world but we're just seeing this
very specific story in it
yeah and the the that's where the kind
of the juvenile element comes from is
that it all just becomes stabbing and
blood and
killing uh and then we're gonna give
spoilers here
so spoilers spoilers uh the first job
nice and easy the
the big fat guy at this event is a
lawyer they say so
clearly the uh he's doing a big case and
somebody else hired to kill the lawyer
who knows but then the second job is she
has to possess a man
uh who's who's dating the daughter of
essentially mark zuckerberg right or uh
bezos jeff bezos some some big tech guy
who owns this company that's essentially
facebook or google or whatever right so
it's the it's the brother
uh who wants the the father dead and the
daughter dead so that he can inherit the
company and become wealthy and
maintain control and so he hires this
company
the possessor company to make it look
like the boyfriend of the girl
went crazy murder suicide
boom nice and easy yeah so that's the
job
and i was like oh there's going to be
some kind of twist
because it's like a tech company right
and they're data mining
so maybe at some point the sean bean the
guy
knows that the guy is possessed and then
he does this and all these things but it
just kind of just becomes this like
like uh pointless bloodbath
and then on top of that i don't
associate
at all with our tilda swinton
well you're not supposed to that's the
story the story isn't the assassination
attempt the story is
the the the toll this job has taken on
her
and how at a certain point the the guy
realizes what's happening and he pulls
the thing out of his brain and they
start to like
they're they're they cross the streams
where they're going back and forth
yeah who is who what is what and you
realize that
this whole time like she hasn't become
desensitized to violence
she's become so obsessed with the
violence that she becomes desensitized
to everything else including her own
family
i mean that's the movie you see like she
has sex with her estranged husband early
on and all she can think about is
stabbing that guy in the neck
so by the time you get to the end when
the guy sort of re
claimed his body right and he's
threatening her husband
it starts to become a thing of like how
much does she want him to kill the
husband too
because she doesn't give a [ __ ] about
these people anymore well then what it's
about losing
your sense of self i mean that's what
the movie is more so than the
assassination
yeah i bet and i know the assassination
isn't the plot
yeah um and i know but but her character
we have such little
little to do with her in the beginning
before she jumps in
and you know it's like oh is it is it
just about money
is it about her raking in just tons of
money because they have her shares in
the company for this big
job and there's never like i mean this
is this is like base level stuff
well plotting right wise where if this
was just a christopher nolan movie
it would be oh oh honey we can't pay the
bills this month
are we're going to houses in foreclosure
uh
little johnny can't go to the school
anymore he's got to move
from the private school to this terrible
public school where he's going to get
beat up
again right i lost my job
and money problems
you remember uh five years ago when you
used to do that
thing where you put on the mask and you
possessed people
this is baseline i i i need to reiterate
that okay
um i don't want to do that again because
when i do it
i go crazy and i lose all sense of
myself and i've just spent the last five
years
in therapy getting over my blood lust
right i mean what you're describing is
probably the backstory
but i didn't get that we're seeing after
that i just i think she's despicable
from the moment
i see her because she's killing i mean
maybe they could have done more than i
think there's enough where like when she
goes over to her
her estranged husband's house she's
outside and she's like rehearsing what
to say
yeah to sound like a normal person i
don't know
i don't my darling hi darling
the little things like that i think
there's just enough i don't like her
either i don't think that's the point
yeah you're not necessarily supposed to
be on her side yeah i'm just observing
her story yeah you could take it another
route too
where you the only time we see the
guy pre uh possession
is is when she's spying on them with
like audio listening
that is something i think we needed to
see more of him earlier yeah i mean
we're not supposed to be
sympathetic towards him empathetic you
do once
once he realizes what's going on once he
tries to like take control
but it feels like when you get to that
point you should have had more with him
up front
you certainly connect with him a bit
more even if you never met the person
if the story is someone has possessed
this person and made him murder his
fiancee
and and his father-in-law in the
bloodbath
of course you're gonna feel sorry for
them it's not their fault right and i
don't want
movies that are just boilerplate
you know this is your hero you know like
they work for certain things but
you know i don't mind a creepy weird
[ __ ] up movie
i just need to know some more
information and it just seemed like
he was reveling in the the
joy of just blood and guts and murder
well that that's yeah that's one thing i
did i like the movie a lot
um did you watch the uncut version do
you know you didn't okay
so you actually saw the less violent
version because
that would be one of my complaints about
it is it feels like
and you want to show when it's a movie
about how this
character is is kind of become uh
accustomed to violence or it doesn't
affect her anymore
you know you want to show that violence
pretty matter effectively but
there are moments where and this is
weird coming from me
but it's like too violent uh there's a
part i think it's sean bean
she like there's like an extreme
close-up and this is only in the uncut
version
where she like scoops out his eyeball
and it's like it's like extreme close-up
it's like a luchio fulchi
like schlock horror film
where it goes past you want to see it
matter effectively and i think they do
that really well for a lot of it but
then
when you cut to these extreme close-ups
it just feels like gratuitous and it
like cheapens it
or it's like look at this look at this
gore it's not showing it
just as like a violent act anymore it's
like reveling in it
in a way that is counterintuitive to
what the movie's trying to do
yeah so there's moments like that that
the the extreme gore and the uncut
version
and i never want to say like watch the
cut version like you should watch the
version the filmmakers intended i think
but i
i think the cut version worked a little
bit better because it cut back on some
of that stuff a bit
yeah the only thing i remember seeing
that made me laugh was
he hits the michael the husband and hits
him with the meat cleaver and it's like
fingers fly on oh yeah
rubber hand and um
you know but that's another one where
then it cuts to an extreme close-up of
the fingers and they're still moving
slightly it's like show it blunt matter
of fact i was thinking a taxi driver a
bit like the end of that movie where
he's just shooting like the guy
because that happens at the beginning of
this movie the girl gets shot in the
cheek and like blood squats
which something really similar to that
happens in taxi driver but taxi driver
is a movie that just shows
shows the gore as it would happen right
it doesn't like celebrate it and it
doesn't like cut to extreme close-ups
right so that's more emphasize for jason
yeah it's like cheap horror movie stuff
which has its place but
it felt out of place in this movie
ready
i just never i would have loved more
inner conflict with
with her character i just i just i just
searched for that
like can we have can she have a moment
of
like hesitation and i think
too he was like a loser
um and and he had like a low he he was
dating
out of his league right this girl is
wealthy her father's wealthy
and he clearly doesn't have any skills
he's he's hired by the father as like a
like a um
like a charity job right and doing
low-level work
and so clearly he feels like
he doesn't have any control she has all
the control
um and so those two kind of character
philosophies could butt at some point
where he
tries to break free and then she
could be a character who's yeah
spiraling downward like let me go in
again i can do another job
that's all these things are explaining
they're there they're just
it feels like it starts 30 minutes into
the movie
where i needed more backstory between
her even if it's even if it's hollywood
backstory crap
like i said oh i can't pay the bills
what are we going to do become a
possessor again
i can't go back in michael i can't i
for me i like the fact that this is just
sort of a smaller glimpse at a larger
kind of worlds and
all the backstory stuff you're talking
about you wish was in there to me i can
it it's it's implied enough where i
i think you get enough in the movie to
to work with
i think that's i think that's what what
really gets me with it
is that i wanted more from it it it was
capable of much more
uh it had so many great um
uh ideas and starting points and and
potential
uh that that whole the whole concept of
of the the technology involved and the
process
yeah on the visuals of like when they
show the
the kind of splintering mine stuff oh
yeah i've seen that stuff we're seeing
it kind of literally where
you see it like bounce back and forth
between her and him yeah
the melting faces the double the
doubling of the vocal
yeah voices his voice on hers at the
same time
like like creepy stuff like that worked
and like when they
when they kidnap the guy they have to
kidnap him
physically in order to put the thing in
knock him out and so he doesn't remember
anything
like you don't see them kidnapping him
it's just like he's in a van
and yeah you know what happened and and
they did it they're just so good at
their job you got them yep we got them
we've done this a million times yes
we're really good at this but uh
i just i i wanted it it had
the bedrock of having a great
great uh character
um conflicts if he had
if he had broken out of the possessor
taken control of the situation that's
what he does
but but he just dies like i mean i mean
unraveled the whole conspiracy about it
okay
opened up the world of the movie a
little more opened up the world of the
movie a little more
prove he's not a murderer um i know
that's a whole
other movie in itself by that time it's
too late to do all that but
i found myself thinking the movie was
lacking
but chick fight now
that's a movie
[Music]
hey why is there a gun on the table
