half in the bag
wait not yet we still have to watch the banana splits movie
this presents the banana split
starring fleegle
bingo
wait maybe just maybe movie theaters will reopen
you know you're right
i never thought i would actually say this but at the very least movie theaters filtered out some of the trash that seems to litter the landscape of amazon prime
who
would have thought that nicholas cage
would sully his good name by appearing
in some low-budget
garbage movie i mean the man won an
oscar
yeah i know you know what jay in the
future i don't think we could be so
reckless
no more random mode no more trusting
rotten tomatoes
we're gonna have to do research of our
own on movies
i would have thought a film starring
nicholas cage would be quality
boy was i wrong i mean it has a major
star in it
and and you trust you trust that you
trust when you see a big name in a film
you never think it's going to be like an
asylum level
piece of turd but it was first nicholas
cage who's next
john travolta bruce willis
i seen the trailer for his new film
breach and it looks great
hey you want to watch this oh it stars
liam neeson it's gotta be good
it's birthday time
well mike willy's wonderland let us down
a rabbit hole of a very small and very
specific
sub-genre of films yes which is
movies that are ripping off the success
and popularity of the video game
five nights at freddy's right which in
turn
is a reference to showbiz pizza well
tucked in between there's the 2008
documentary
the rock rockifier explosion yes which
we
have conveniently have a dvd copy of
right here there it is
this documentary came out yeah like you
said 2008 uh let's look at the timeline
okay i'm i i don't know anything about
five nights at freddy's i watched the
video game trailer for it on youtube
because you told me what it was but
i think all this i did a little timeline
and i think all this
started with this yeah this uh
of course it started with this
documentary's about weirdos who like to
purchase the leftover um
showbiz pizza bear band members and
restore them
yeah maybe for people that don't even
know what the [ __ ] that is just a little
back story it was a pizza and game place
for children in the 80s
showbiz pizza place with over 60
electronic games
pizza bake fresh every day and the stage
show extravaganza on three stages
uh spun off into chuck e cheese which
chugga chu's bought them out chucky
cheese bought them out
uh did chuck e cheese go out of business
last year i think they went bankrupt
last year
don't know i wouldn't doubt it due to
the pandemic yeah i'm surprised they
were still around
yeah showbiz pizza place uh i don't know
where it was all located certainly the
midwest
yeah i think down south a little i went
there i had birthday parties there as a
little kid
maybe birthday party yeah um
as as seen in the famous rich evans
photo although
i probably have childhood birthday
photos from there but
my mother didn't put a shirt on me that
said [ __ ] the birthday boy
um uh
she knows proper comma usage um
but yeah you you would there would be a
big table there's the party room right
there's the game room
yes and then there's the party room and
the party room would have three
to twelve large tables and at the head
of the table was a king's chair
and that's where you would sit if you
were the birthday boy or girl right and
you would get a little crown i think
and um although your friends would come
and there would be tape presents in the
middle of the table and you go play
games you run back and forth
eat pizza and then of course the
highlight was
when billy bob the bear and his band
would perform
the rockefeller explosion yes and it
would happen i don't know every 15
minutes or something and then
and you know even as a kid you thought
it was kind of strange
and not magical that was like five no i
thought it was i thought the
animatronics were neat i didn't know go
to showbiz i went to chuck e cheese
um but it was just fun to watch these
robots but i didn't think they were like
i didn't believe them as being real i
don't know if any kid did
maybe two and under okay i think once
you hit three
that's when the magic wears off when you
realize there's something
horribly wrong then then you want to
ignore the band and just go play in the
ball pits
yeah and you know it's more like a
background thing it wasn't like the kids
all ran up to the stage and
danced and stuff it was just sort of
like a cute thing that happened in the
background
so um i i wouldn't want to
judge any grown adults love of their
childhood or
billy bob the singing bear but to each
his own
yes but before before this documentary i
don't know if it was that
widely known to people other than people
that were nostalgic for it when they
were a small child but there weren't a
lot of people talking about
showbiz pizza or the rock of fire
explosion band
right this documentary came out and then
a couple years later unrelated we
introduced the world to the infamous
dick the birthday boy picture
mike discovered this old photo from
rich's birthday and so
we as a present we have painstakingly
uh recreated this lovely shirt that he's
wearing
and we're gonna give it to him as a
birthday slash halloween episode gift
did you like steal my old family
photographs is there like an album of
mine
in your possession this is creepy
which i discovered in a pile of trash
in 2001 or two
okay uh and it was rich was throwing out
family photos
a lot of people know the story yeah but
he was throwing out family photos and
there's just piles of polaroids from his
childhood i was throwing in the trash
so i grabbed them and i saved them and
one of them was the dick the birthday
boy photo
now famous that's that's uh gone on to
be more popular than us
there are people that have no idea that
this is even connected to us and
probably think
our episode from 2013 is a reference to
this but no
it did not exist on the internet before
this right because this is actually rich
evans that's
actually not a lie yes it is a real true
picture of rich evans as dick the
birthday boy
and it has been featured on awkward
family photos
cursed images uh famously the ellen show
yes okay i'm sorry but i cannot take my
eyes off
the birthday boy
before ellen was canceled back before
ellen got cancelled and julia roberts
back before she got cancelled
she said um i i worked at
showbiz pizza and um so
people think that that's her in the
costume yeah some intern at ellen just
googled showbiz pizza bear it's the
first image that shows up so they just
used it
and it's fine now people think that the
lore is that julia roberts is next to
rich evans in this photo
it's not true that's not julia roberts
right julia roberts i think grew up in
the south yeah like georgia georgia yeah
so uh odds that she lived
up in the chicagoland area for a brief
moment of time while working at shoba's
pizza then moved back down
are highly improbable yes
you know who is in that costume though
meg ryan
flash forward one year later to 2014
uh five nights at freddy's the video
game is made
and there begins a tangled tale
of rights and movies
and everything else because
it becomes kind of messy after that and
two films emerged
from the muck one being
willie's wonderland and one being the
banana splits
movie which has its own history because
banana splits was a
hanna-barbera cartoon in like the 60s no
not a cartoon it was a live action
it was live action that introduced
cartoons the only thing i i like
that's i don't even know anything about
it other than the theme song
like everybody knows that yeah um it
sort of i mean
it predates us oh yeah by a long shot it
was
19 it ran from 68 to 70. it was brief
they were they were people in costumes
that ran around they drove the little
car
all that kind of stuff yeah and um and
and then it was like interspersed with
cartoons
okay the costumes were made by sid and
marty croft
creators of puppets and i think they did
hr puff and stuff and
you know that that was their thing those
weird psychedelic uh guy in costume
shows that was like a late 60s
to late 70s kind of thing jimmy
what happened to you why are you walking
that way
but with banana splits uh that was like
a property that
some studio owned wasn't doing anything
with because what do you do with them
so then someone says oh hey this five
nights at freddy's thing is popular
let's
let's we have this property let's just
make a horror movie based on this old
property
because it's kind of like the fried
knights of freddy's right it's it's a
very bizarre history there there was a
mention also that there was a comic book
crossover
with the the um the banana splits gang
and the suicide squad i mean there's
this like
sort of bizarre history with with these
characters and
i think at one point it it passed hands
from hannah barbera to warner brothers
and then i think that's who put out the
movie right yeah and then they're the
ones
and who said sure let's do this and
we'll make it really cheap
we'll make it really cheap but also the
script
for this banana splits movie is
supposedly
purportedly taken from a rejected script
for the freddie five nights at freddy's
uh movie okay which is why they're
robots
ah i mean on the tv show they were just
things
right you know like living creatures
living creatures that but
but they they're robots in this i assume
they just did that because they wanted
to make it closer to five nights at
freddy's
which is its own movie that's been in
development hell for years
supposedly it's coming out shooting this
year
coming out in like another year or two
which is well after the popularity of
the video game has wore
off can we also briefly mention there's
a
five minute short on hulu called the hug
it's far better than either of these two
features or better one it gets to the
point real quick
it doesn't take up a lot of your time
but well so aesthetically
it's much better yeah it's that's well
we'll start talking about these movies
now willie's wonderland is [ __ ] awful
the band splits movie is not as awful
and then the hug the five minute short
using that premise of evil animatronic
kids show mascots is the one that nails
that the best
right they shot it in what looks like
probably a real chuck e cheese
or if it's a set it's a damn good set
but they have the different areas
all set up and it looks it looks uh like
a believable
location which is already a notch above
willy's wonderland
which is just like a square set where
you have
the dining area and there's a ball pit
right next to it in the same room and it
doesn't feel like a believable place at
all
and that's the entire premise of your
movie yeah if you want to watch
uh willie's wonderland just watch the
hug
because it has the exact same storyline
there's a there's a nasty little kid in
the hug who gets what he deserves
because
gosh darn it he cheated at skee-ball
so he's a little bastard he's throwing
he's put he's climbed on the skee-ball
machine and he's throwing the balls in
the top slot and he's getting all the
tickets
and he it's his birthday god damn it he
wants to see and he so he steals the guy
the janitor's keys or the
manager or whatever and the manager
knows the secret yeah he says don't go
behind the curtain the
the bear or whatever it is taking a
break right and the kid sneaks back
there and he gets what he deserves
and he knows the secret of the bear
which is it is the bear costume
he looks exactly like billy bob yeah
it's just a
facade for like a monster or a demon
underneath and it eats the child
great got it it's perfect for a
five-minute short yes
it did just what it needed to do and
then the cost of monster looks good the
yeah uh it was designed by stupid buddy
studios
oh you did some research well i looked
in the credits the credits were rolling
i was watching the credits and i
recognized stupid buddy and i'm like why
is that familiar that they do the
uh stop motion and stuff for um the seth
green show what is it no
yeah so i think they do like effects and
props and
uh makeup and whatnot so it's effective
like the way the the the fake
face kind of falls off when there's the
demon face underneath yeah it's perfect
for what this is
yeah so i don't know why that was made
it said it was part of hulu ween
short films and it was it like a
like a hey we want to direct the
five nights at freddy's yeah here's our
thing we made
you know it was one of those kind of
things who knows when they did the uh
didn't they do like a test version of
the deadpool they did a scene from
deadpool and that's what ended up
getting made into the movie
right yeah yeah you're right you're
right about that jay
i don't know we're going to kind of talk
about both films yes
we'll compare them yeah willie's
wonderland is closer to the concept of
five nights at freddy's which is you
have to survive overnight
in this freddy's place uh with these
evil mascots
yes and that's the premise of willy's
wonderland nicolas cage
is playing kind of like the man with no
name he's passing through town he's got
a western vibe he doesn't talk
through the whole movie uh and the local
townspeople his tires go out on his car
they say stay overnight in willie's
wonderland clean the place up and we'll
fix your car for free
so he has to stay overnight with these
evil animatronic characters who he
very easily defeats in one scene after
the other that is very
repetitive and [ __ ] boring and and
visually disgusting yeah and
and not in a good way no you want your
twisted showbiz pizza place to look
great
grungy and gross and disgusting but this
is
ugly in a low budgety kind of way yeah
well like i said the room
there's like a side room that they call
the game room even though it doesn't
have hardly any games in it right but
the main room
is there's the stage which isn't a stage
it's just one side of the room
and then there's the tables where people
sit to eat and then the ball pit is
right there
yeah and it's just like they just slap
things together like hey we gotta have a
ball pit that's right there
and the puppets they look evil from the
beginning
you need that and that's one thing i'll
say about the banana splits movie is you
need that
contrast of cutesy colorful kids
characters that then do evil things
right
yeah there's that there's that one part
i think
where oh no that was the hug he grabs
the
he he once he starts hugging the little
kid
and then the eyes roll back and they're
blank white
oh yeah come back and they're like
bloodshot disgusting and
it takes its time to build that up yeah
in in uh willie's wonderland
nicholas cage is cleaning the bathroom
and then the big like
ape character is just behind him and he
just immediately starts fighting him
without any
reaction to what's happening i mean i
guess they're going for that man with no
name
stoic silent character but in the
context of this movie it doesn't work
clint eastwood talked okay you can get
away with not talking but i was thinking
especially after that first that
bathroom fight
is like you need like a bruce campbell
in this role i was reminded a lot of the
evil dead movies that's clearly like an
influence
but you need someone who is maybe like
thinks of himself as a badass or like a
braggart but then
is a complete buffoon in reality yeah
you you need
some sort of change in emotion or at
least some sort of reaction to how
bizarre what's happening is and nicolas
cage he beats up that monster very
easily
and then this goes right back to
cleaning which i think is supposed to be funny
it gives you nothing to latch on to in
the movie well it's it's
possibly one of the worst scripts i've
seen turned into a movie
yeah it's it's indescribably bad like
uncreative very uncreative um and like
you said
with the nicholas cage character you
need
he either he's he's driving around he he
wants a sports car
this is nicholas cage's writer or
requests for
for being in the movie right sure i
don't want to say any lines
i don't want to learn [ __ ] dialogue
for this [ __ ] yes exactly
and it says nicholas cage had i i read
some facts he was like a producer on the
movie
that's that's where you get will you get
money later yeah
if you just throw your name on it as a
producer um that's [ __ ]
he didn't do a single thing um but
he he it said nicholas cage always
wanted to star in a
in a no dialogue horror film or
you know it's like no no this isn't it
and that's a lie he just didn't want to
memorize lines and he said give me a
sports car
drive around and make me look awesome
make me look awesome um
give me the best hair dye around the
best plugs
and use that that computer to
make my face look less old and and
oh and he also wanted to excessively
drink beer
which that's not beer mike it's soda
it's an energy drink
i thought there was going to be a payoff
to that here's here's the
he's constantly drinking after the whole
movie i was like that's going to lead to
something an epic piss no no
here's here's here's the logic here's
the logic and the script for that jeff
okay
right right one there's two two points
of logic to have him
constantly drinking energy drinks at
timed intervals
one no human
on earth would agree to clean a nasty
old building yeah all night long without
sleep right sure most people sleep
that's true okay so there's one why
we're talking about nicolas
i'm talking about his character not him
personally um
unless he's a robot or you know an alien
or something
he needs to sleep no one's going to say
yeah okay well i'm going to work for a
couple hours but you know once it gets
dark i'm just gonna go to sleep and
i'll meet you in the morning i'm not
cleaning every square inch of this nasty
warehouse
to fix my [ __ ] flat tire right most
people are reasonable
and they need to sleep two he defeats
these robots which which have no or
creatures demons what they're possessed
whatever they're possessed by the
spirits of dead serial killers that
opened the
restaurant originally yes yes and
worship satan in worship satan uh
so they're possessed right and but they
have no ability to
kill you but they've had that ability to
kill
other people for years yeah yeah the
town is all in on it and they give this
thing
out of towners as sacrifices so nicholas
cage seemingly
a regular man you know he's not
he's not super buff he's not a
mma fighter we don't introduce him as
that or as a
special forces green beret i just got
back from [ __ ] afghanistan
and i'm looking to whoop some he's just
a guy a man with no name
clint eastwood character and he defeats
these things very easily
whacking them with a broom handle and
that is because
he's amped up on energy drinks
that's the reason the energy drinks are
there oh god see i thought it was going
to turn out that he has some sort of
history with these things or connection
to him
where like he was prepared to fight them
and that's why the other people they've
killed is because they're caught off
guard they're just staying overnight in
this place oh my god they came to life
and they get killed immediately
but he kills them with absolutely no
issues and no problems
so i thought it was going to turn out
that he secretly went there
for the purpose of killing them maybe he
has a long history of killing demons
he just killed his daughter back in the
day something
anything anything
that's part of the problem they kicked
him out sure yeah but oh yeah
personal vendetta you're expecting way
too much i was expecting a story the
entirety behind it
is wouldn't it be cool if nicolas cage
killed
showbiz pizza bear and that's what they
pitched their movie on yeah so they
pitched it to him
they said you're gonna be like the
drifter that comes through town who's
badass
and you don't have to say a single line
of dialogue that's going to be our
gimmick too
because cage doesn't speak a single kind
of dialogue in the whole movie
well wow that's some kind of [ __ ]
achievement really no it's not
it makes your movie much
worse yeah because like you said if he
if he was a braggart or
had some kind of history like like he
was a
ex-soldier ex-marine or something like
that and then he gets in there and he
fights the first
billy bob right and and maybe there's
some teens in there with him and he's
like don't worry i got this
and he gets his ass kicked and he gets
knocked down a peg like eventually at
some point during
the movie you know your third act drop
when things go bad for your protagonist
and they have to work their way out of a
problem
that occurs in a movie not in this movie
but he just beats up one after the other
i was shocked at the ending i thought
because he finally gets there's like the
main
character willie and so like we get to
the final confrontation with him and i
was like okay they're gonna do something
special for this fight right
and then nicolas cage just beats him
with a stick
and then it's over i was stunned at the
the laziness of everything
involved with the story of the movie
right right it was shocking it was
shockingly bad
the the vagus resemblance of anything
screenplay wise is the girl has a
backstory of her parents being killed
and the
the old lady cop rescuing her
as a baby or a child or whatever and
then so her
sole mission in life is to on a nightly
basis
try to burn down willie's willie's
wonderland or whatever
how long has she been trying to do this
you tried it once and got caught yeah
uh how often how hard is it to like
gasoline on fire
is this after you know 15 years
or 10 years is this your first time
trying to do it or did you try it the
night before
have you ever tried to inform anyone
outside of the town that this is
happening
like basic things yeah uh people are
missing
their last stop was in your town contact
the fbi
you know yeah but i don't know they say
the town has no internet
or whatever [ __ ] whatever whatever
[ __ ] excuse they can come up with to
get away with being as lazy as possible
right so so she she wants to try again
to burn down the place so she invites
five or six of her friends
no i'm not it's the truth
yeah you are very lucky well maybe you
should have a girl mark
one of which has a crush on her the boy
but he just dies and then everyone just
dies it doesn't matter
then there's like the the um i don't i'm
sure it was a tongue-in-cheek kind of
thing where the two teens go off to have
sex where it's like a trope
yeah and then in the party room in the
party room but
even though they already know that the
monsters are killing people in there
it'd be one thing if they weren't away
jay it's funny
you gotta present it as funny though but
it's like the the most
pathetic excuse for a sex scene
and the most pathetic sex scene
everything about it's terrible it's just
like they're just like dry humping on
the ground and supposing they're having
sex
just don't even do it do something
different do something creative
i don't know if this movie was just
atrocious i'm sorry
and visually it was disgusting the color
grading on it
everything's just like greenish blue and
disgusting looking
and like i said you need that contrast
with the creatures with the the puppets
which was one of the things that was
kind of amusing about the banana splits
movie
which is not a movie i would really
recommend but in comparison to willie's
wonderland
it's a masterpiece oh yeah um but the
creatures constantly feel like
kids show characters in that and the
setup in that is that they're they're
robots they're animatronic
and their their programming gets [ __ ]
up on the last day
that they're filming the show ever the
show's being canceled
and so they start killing people but
they're doing it in like
over the top violent ways that's kind of
fun to watch
oh yeah it's kind of disturbing and
weird and disgusting
i mean oh my god all the different
little avenues of the script
yeah are just there's actual characters
in the script i know there's a family
they have a step dad who's a [ __ ]
there's the girl that's there with her
dad who wants to try and introduce their
daughter to
to the producers of the show he's like a
showbiz parent
you have characters you have the the
vlogging couple
that want to vlog the whole thing the
family
dynamic is they actually tried like the
mother
the father died a while ago and so the
last 10 years
she's been with this other guy remarried
he's a dick
the little boy you know he's like an
[ __ ] to the little boy and the boy
has an older brother
they're not they're half brothers um and
so he's like taking him under his wing
you know and then you find out the
husband's cheating
the spoiler um nobody cares but then you
got the
the multiple characters that there's a
producer lady with the glasses
there's paige who's the audience page
who kind of has a romance with the older
brother i mean there's so much going on
it's the most basic of story writing of
screenplays but
but for that movie it's fine and it's
something as opposed to willie's
wonderland
yeah willie and they set up because they
they go there for a taping of the show
and they have like almost like a double
dare esque obstacle course
and it's like ah fun obstacle course you
run through slime and all this stuff
and then that comes back in the third
act where it's like the horror version
of that obstacle course
it pays off
it's a competent script for what it is
yeah
and and yeah oh after watching willy's
wonderland [ __ ] anything else
but um for for what it was trying to do
and it
made use of all the different like all
the characters weren't just evil there's
one of the
banana splits gang who is good yeah and
so there's a little twist there
there's just more things going on more
to do more set pieces they go to
different locations
and it takes it seriously enough where
it works as
camp three chairs for rebecca
hip hip hooray like they know it's not
serious but they're they're presenting
it as serious
and it's kind of amusing when you get to
the third act and they have like all
those children
enslaved right and they're making and
watch the horror version of the show
like that was funny
and the mom has an arc she kind of
becomes a badass right there's fun
her shirt gets caught for a second and
so it just flies off and so she's got
the
captain picard tank top which turns into
that mode
yeah they didn't shy away from
uh doing good gore effects like
the first kill the one of the
banana splits grabs like a big lollipop
oh yeah i thought oh for sure he's gonna
stab him in the ear
or the eye with the sharp end of the
lollipop but
hey hey they're one step ahead of me
he sticks the wide end of the lollipop
in his mouth and it lodges in its throat
in the guy's throat
yeah and it's like blood is coming up
everywhere and then the the part where
the vlogger gets sawed in half
and of course all the intestines fall
out and
it's goofy looking it's not realistic
looking um
but the deaths are weird
like the guy and they're all different
yeah the the
like the stage dad the uh
oh yeah he he gets sprayed in the face
with like aerosol
and he gets burns all over his face but
he still lives and the character's like
dancing around him while his head's on
fire
at first it looked bad but then they had
a real appliance that was on yeah there
was a composite shot that wasn't great
but um so for the rest of the movie that
guy's face is horribly burnt
and then he's forced to do the the
um while his face is burnt
and i he once he fell in the goo like
the slime
like nickelodeon slime could kind of go
and i just wanted him to go oh it burns
like just like just to make it just more
horrific
so i laughed quite a bit during um the
banana splits
movie it gets a gold medal when compared
to willie's wonderland which may have
been the worst thing i've ever seen yeah
yeah and all the the action in willy's
wonderland talking about like the pacing
of things like
so much shaky cam like constant cutting
everything about it is so visually ugly
from the color grading to the editing to
the lighting of the movie
to the cheap ass set your whole movie
takes place on that one set
make it a good set it's good advice
oh what are you looking around for oh i
just thought i heard a noise
in the back oh my god that whole wall is
shaking
jesus that doesn't seem right i don't
know yeah
that's weird it is an old building
that's true
and i was confused about
nicholas cage between he goes back and
forth he kills a creature
and then he goes back to cleaning and
then he goes into the kitchen
where there is for some reason a pinball
machine
like why is that not in the game room
why is he playing this pinball machine
in the kitchen
and why is he playing it at all again i
thought that was a setup for something
where there was some reason he was
playing it he went to willie's
wonderland as a kid and he never
defeated it and so now he's
back to defeat the machine or something
beat his high score
he just goes back there and plays it for
no reason oh jay it's like you've seen a
movie before
i mean why have these things in the
movie other than
you got to fill 90 minutes because
nicolas cage beating up these
mascots isn't enough uh material for
your feature
well it was an official willys
wonderland pinball machine
right why was it in the kitchen i don't
know why i was in the kitchen why were
there no games in the game room
because cause here's why i have answers
to all these questions
one they knew a guy who custom made
pinball machines
he custom makes them and so i could make
one for you oh cool
okay here it is oh wow it's neat where
are we going to put it
in the game room well we don't have any
other games it would be weird if it was
just by itself in the game room
well maybe it's in the kitchen maybe the
like the the the dishwashers use it when
they're on their break
and we got to use it because i knew a
guy who made custom pinball machines
okay how about nick cage plays it every
now and then in the movie just so we
could
show close-ups of it yeah because we got
a real willy's wonderland
okay why don't we fill the game room
with
tons of games because a third of our
budget went to nicholas cage
that's why i'd say over half of their
budget went to nicolas cage
then and and it's really expensive to
rent and leave these games here and
they want insurance on them because they
might get damaged during the production
and that's when someone steps in and
says but this is the concept for your
whole movie
sad to say i i'm baffled by
the i think it's 60 rotten tomatoes
oh my god and then a 78 audience
wow they're like a wild ride from start
to fit
and i'm just like see i hate i hate
movies like this
where they're like they're trying to
sell it as like a new
kind of cult movie it's so crazy
nicholas cage he's like a human meme
and you put him in your movie and you
don't have to do any more work than that
where people are already sold on the
movie they already know they're going to
like it based on that and no matter how
[ __ ] terrible it is they're just like
but it's so crazy because nicholas cage
beats up puppets
it's like no you have to put some level
of creativity into your movie
and you know we all have our our guilty
pleasures
you know i enjoy stupid things
here and there but uh i i can just
smell smell the lazy
and i can i can just feel the the grime
all over my body after watching that and
and as soon as it started this is how
cynical i am
i see the car driving yeah our own
ultimate
movie if you if i drive around in a
[ __ ] sports car
because i'm nicholas cage i don't drive
in anything but a [ __ ] sports car
blah blah blah i was in that movie drive
angry
uh i'll only be in a movie if i would
never ever have to take sunglasses off
during a [ __ ] sports car and i'm
[ __ ] passing a leather jacket
so here comes the sports car yeah and
i'm i'm counting the seconds of screen
time not nicholas cage not nicholas cage
man steps out boots hit the ground not
in nicolas cage not
trunk opens uh shot ends right before
resisting not necklace
hands reach in grab energy drink not
nicolas cage not next
mouth
we panned up too much we got to bring
him in yeah cut
bring him out of the trailer he's strong
he's strong he's passed out he just has
to stand there and not fall down
okay fine he's done for the day when i
make things even worse this is one of
those
like uh early access movies that they do
now since theaters aren't open
to trick you were they charged twenty
dollars
do not pay money for this
do not get fooled ignore the ratings and
the reviews
trust us it's not wacky and crazy it's
one of the worst most boring things i've
seen i almost didn't finish it and
that's saying a lot for me
i watched so much trash the death scenes
in um
the banana splits movie were far far
better yeah each one's different and
creative
uh the story goes in different areas you
know takes some different turns here and
there
all around much better movies characters
grow and change
yeah although if you're somebody who
grew up in like the early 70s and
has like fond memories of the banana
splits gang you're probably
really confused so bizarre yeah such a
bizarre backstory to that movie like
this wacky kids show that all the
different like
incarnations of it yeah but it makes
sense that if it was
a temporary or an early draft of a
script for
five nights at freddy's that it makes
sense yeah speaking of the robots that's
something that neither movie gets right
they never feel like animatronic
creatures they just feel like guys in
suits
they do a little bit better in uh banana
splits movie occasionally they kind of
move like robots yeah yeah they have
that walk
and they add some sound effects but
they're yeah you could tell but willie's
wonderland i mean the one there's like
the the fairy ballerina one
where she just has a head on and then
her body is just like human hands they
didn't even [ __ ] try
right there's a lady running around with
that i forgot about that yeah after
oh and that whole ending the fairy
princess
jumps on top of the car blows it up
somehow yeah
and it's just like this terrible
terrible effect it looks like suburban
sasquatch
and that's my go-to comparison for lazy
plug-in effects
that's the draw of low-budget movies
like you look at like old roger corman
movies and stuff made in the
like when we watch a best of the worst
movie when they blow up a car
and they really blow it up it's always
exciting and it's fun
because you say oh they blew up a car
and it's always in the middle
of the desert yeah or a field which adds
to the amusement and this they're in an
empty parking lot
right yeah buy buy a 600
car get a pyrotechnics guy i guess you
got to get a permit
and you got to pay money and blah blah
blah blah but that's that's the movie
these are things you put in a movie to
make them interesting
this this movie rides the line between
movie and scam
yeah although a mild recommendation for
the banana splits movie even though it's
a couple years old now
yeah i think it came out last year or
the year before but if you're looking
for this type of movie
that's the go-to one that's yeah if you
have to choose
yeah until the five nights at freddy's
movie comes out if that ever happens
it should make a showbiz pizza place
horror themed movie an official one yeah
who wants the rights to show his pizza
anymore
uh well uh marshmallow calls
chuck e cheese bought them so they must
own them
i don't know i don't know how that works
they won't make a if chuck e cheese is
still around i think they went bankrupt
though but if they are still around they
won't make a chucky cheese horror movie
but revive billy bob make a horror film
here here's here's
here's the big big big money jay oh
chucky cheese versus billy bob
like freddie versus jason oh that's
where the real money is it's true
i love it let's do it okay start making
some phone calls
hello nicholas cage do you like money
