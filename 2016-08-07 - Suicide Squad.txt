half in the bag
yes i did it you hear that jay
that's the sound of lightning fast vcr
repair
going online oh my god i haven't heard
this sound in
25 years i'm assuming this isn't a fiber
optic connection with at least
megabits per second uh no it's actually
just plugged into our phone line
so if somebody calls us we get kicked
offline
what the guy that sold it to me at the
gas station said it was top of the line
and i believed him
what are you doing oh i'm just going on
to rotten tomatoes
i wanted to check the score for that new
suicide squad movie
oh my god what did you learn from the
internets
well the score is really bad oh well
that's no surprise yeah but
i found a website where somebody has
started a petition to shut down rotten
tomatoes
just because they give dc movies bad
scores
oh wow really i wanted to get rotten
tomatoes shut down for giving positive
reviews to the ghostbusters remake
the system is rigged here's what it says
we need this site to be shut down
because its critics always give the dc
extended universe movies
unjust bad reviews like 1.
batman v superman dawn of justice and 2.
suicide squad oh there's just two
there's just two listed yeah that counts
as always well that justifies shutting
down an entire website
especially one that's owned by warner
brothers yeah definitely
the company they're clearly biased
against their own movies yeah
uh and that affects people's opinion
even if it's
really great movies oh my god could you
fit more grammatical errors into one
paragraph
i tell you jay i just don't understand
this world anymore
i know we've got things like disease
poverty andy dick and terrorism but
clearly this is a priority
i tell you jay this new suicide squad
movie makes me want to grab some rope
get a chair go up into my attic
and commit to learning all the nautical
rope knots
you know like anchor bend
bow line bow line on a bite
bunt line hitch butterfly knot
carrick bend heaving line knot
icicle hitch midshipman's hitch
mooring hitch rolling
hitch running bow line
sailor's coil stevedore stopper knot
truckers oh my god dc is back with
another
thing this time it's called suicide
squad
a film about all the executives at dc oh
wait sorry with man of steel and batman
v
superman dc has attempted to
differentiate themselves from marvel
superhero films by adopting a dark
gritty more realistic aesthetic
they continue to try and be different
from marvel with suicide squad
by featuring a giant blue laser shooting
up into the sky
characters exchanging quippy dialogue
and a terrible villain with weak
motivation who has an army of faceless
henchmen for our heroes to kill
endlessly with no moral qualms
nothing like marvel movies at all the
joker the most iconic villain in comic
book history
shows up to have no relation or impact
on the plot whatsoever
thanks for nothing jay what did you
think of suicide squad
um why did you say that so sing-songy i
don't know
did the movie put you in the mood for
music after all the the endless
endless pop songs suicide squad
aka paying royalties
i have the budget head to go to music
every five seconds there's a new fucking song
we'll talk about that we'll talk
about that and why that's there
okay i know why because i'm a cynical
man with
with the heart of cole um i would
describe this movie as frustrating
fucking frustrating i think i hated it
and that's what's frustrating is that
there was a lot of elements in it that i
actually thought could have been good
and there's some stuff in the final edit
that i think is actually good but i kind
of feel the same way about it
that i did about that fantastic four
movie where
the re-edits and reshoots and moving
around scenes
is so obvious that it's hard to even
judge this as a
completed movie yeah it echoes uh
fantastic for a whole lot
uh it's it's studio meddling the sequel
yes because i did a little reading on
this
and it's very similar to the josh trank
debacle
although david ayer didn't like publicly
say horrible things
about the studio that will ensure that
he never works again in hollywood
i think i think i feel very sorry
are they saving money on budget by
hiring like
like c-level directors like well they're
hiring people for these fucking movies that have a voice
someone like josh trank
who's made a movie with a vision
david ayer's done movies with a vision
why hire these people
why why like why hire someone that that
is a director that has things that they
want to say
yeah and then and then and then just
change it all later hire brett ratner
who will do whatever the fuck you want
it makes no sense to me why they keep
hiring these people well also
they need to they need to figure out
what the fuck they want to do before they start rolling the cameras
well that's the problem is they don't
know what they want until they see what
they don't want
well they don't know what they want
until they see what others have made
that is successful
yeah and then take the footage you
already have and rearrange it to try and
get it to the tone of something else
yes that's exactly what happened here
because like you said
i can also see a movie uh in this mess
oh yeah because the first half of this
movie is a complete mess
complete mess it feels like the first
half of this movie feels like
a sequel because it keeps cutting these
flashbacks
and the flashbacks are clearly at one
point were full scenes that have been
like chopped up and truncated
and when it cuts to him it's like oh
we're cutting the footage from the first
movie
but this is the first movie yeah and
like the joker's just there
the most iconic uh superhero villain
ever and it's like oh there he is
he's just in a scene i wish i could see
that scene because it might be
interesting
where you have harley quinn before she
goes nuts and she's his therapist or
whatever and
it's like oh i would like to see oh
we're out of that scene now now we're
back to viola davis
explaining that they have to assemble
this team and then the minute that
ends she goes into a boardroom and
explains that they need to assemble a
team there's a lot of repetition in this
movie
yeah um and and
her assembling a team to fight this
threat she
unwittingly creates the threat that was
the most frustrating part is like
she's like we we need to we need to
assemble this team
because superman he turned out to be a
good guy but the next person like him to
come down to our planet might not be a
good guy
so we need to assemble harley quinn with
a baseball bat to combat
zod
now
what the fuck is she gonna do what is
jai courtney with a boomerang going to
do against a super powered uh
uh alien from another planet so that
plan is stupid
she says hey uh enchantress this witch
lady
you're gonna be in charge of the suicide
squad because i think that they can do
something for some reason
and then immediately the enchantress
turns evil and
and uh becomes the main bad guy of the
movie and then viola davis is like we
need to stop enchantress
i told you like this whole thing is your
fault
the entire movie is viola davis fault it
makes her look like a dumbass
when they combed through the the
enchantress
which which layer they never found the
little little bottle that held her
secret evil brother
get some clay and a kiln and make a
little bottle to put the enchantress
back
in it but it worked in uh in ancient
times
sure it might work again i don't know
how i guess they had the cat i say
magic words or something and we don't
know those anymore so they couldn't put
them back in
a very fragile breakable bottle also
what fucking person who calls themselves
an
archaeologist finds an ancient thing and
like cracks it
oh they pick up that shit very carefully, jay
and they put it down the guy and
touching this she goes
i'll just break this
eh, whatever
what the fuck
maybe she's new to it this is her first
uh her first time out
she she was like an archaeology student
and she she was sick the day they uh
they taught the lesson
don't break artifacts
what's this uh cheerleading trials
hi boys i have a feeling the original
edit like the first half of the movie
was
these weren't flashbacks and this was
just like here's a character
and here's what they're doing here's the
other characters i was thinking of
uh the movie sorcerer directed by
william friedkin
which that's sort of a a group of
misfits
banned together for a mission that
starts about halfway through the movie
the first half of the movie is here's
one of these characters they really
establish him and then
here's another character in another part
of the world and they really establish
who that is
and then halfway through the movie they
get to the mission i kind of felt like
that's what maybe the original cut of
this movie was before they fucked everything up and threw the footage into a wood chipper
well yeah it's it's a lot of characters
to
introduce though and and you would need
that
really slow pacing yeah i have a feeling
that's what it was but the weird thing
is
they they try and introduce them all
quickly with these jump cutty flashbacks
and then after they're done doing that
we're reintroduced to them again
where they go like cell to cell it's
like we know these are now
it's a fucking mess and then in the
third act of the movie the start of the
third act we get a flashback to
something that happened in the first
act of the movie we already saw this
it's not even giving us new information
it's just here's that scene you already
saw yeah i mean it's it's a
the first half of the movie is a
terrible mess and then
that ending um you kind of get
a an idea of what the director was going
for
they're the best scene in the movie is
when they all just kind of go, ah, fuck, fuck you
we're going to go on this
bar and drink yeah and then you know
well that's where the movie slows down
it slows down yeah and they do some
characterization
and i was like oh god uh joel kinnaman
don't come in
and say you're in love with the
enchantress and that's the reason why
and he could say i love him oh god no
other than that
it was a really nice slow scene and then
after that everything got
very dramatic yeah and and you and i was
like okay
this is kind of working for me i like
the dark tone
i like it and well i like the dark tone
in contrast with how
weird everybody is it's not going for
like jokey quippy
it's just these are just weird
characters right and i liked that i
didn't like the villain and that's what
killed the ending for me is all the the
cgi witch flying around and the
laser got him in the sky i didn't like
that stuff but yeah like you said i can
see what he was going
for i i kind of did like that part
because i'll explain to you in a minute
but you felt
you saw kind of what what he was going
for and how
and the thing that ruined the movie for
me was yeah
it's like dc
panicked they saw how successful
deadpool was deadpool was
very very lighthearted yeah very funny
and then you have guardians of the
galaxy and i think what i read was they
did test screenings as they always do
and people were like it's not funny
but it's not dark yeah and then the
studio's like yeah we'll
we'll try and do both we'll find the
best of both worlds well the story is
they they had
multiple editors doing different cuts of
the movie
they had a they hired a trailer house to
do a cut
of the movie yeah and i think that's the
yeah trailer so i think they went with
that version
where it's like let's cram in as many
pop songs as we can the first 10 minutes
of this movie
feel like a big trailer it's like five
pop songs in a row it's just
endless and they're all so obvious
like as far as uh you know the lyrics of
the song i was thinking of the watchmen
movie
that does that too or it has really
obvious songs
and i'm and i'm watching these scenes
and i'm picturing them without the music
and and so it's almost like yeah tonally
it's it throws it off
yeah it's like hey we're guardians of
the galaxy we're funny and and
you know quippy and there's humor and
and i have a feeling that it wasn't
supposed to be like that with the
exception of harley quinn
and her little like lines that she
throws out
lets her character it's fine yeah and
she's
the best part of the movie margo roby
robbie
how do you pronounce it i think it's
roby whatever it is she
is great in this and i actually liked
will smith in this quite a bit too which
is surprising because i normally don't
like him but he's
way more low-key and he's of course the
heart of the movie because he's got a
daughter and there's that connection
and when this movie just slowed down and
focused on them
i liked some of it yeah but the harley
quinn other than her
like it it doesn't doesn't make sense
for them to use her
uh obviously she's the joker's
girlfriend so
don't let her out of that cage because
that's just inviting disaster
because he's gonna try and come get her
by the way when they let her out of the
cage
and they're heading into the city for
their mission she's like
texting the joker why does she have a
cell phone
why the fuck did they give her a cell
phone
maybe she found one while they were
walking around on the street i really
don't know
but yeah that's a bad idea plus she's
clearly
mentally unstable yeah and she said and
what is she going to do the only person
that has any abilities that would help
them is maybe the
pyro guy yeah jay courtney with a
boomerang
like what's he going to do against a
super powered uh uh witch demon
oh i'm not gonna kill you i'm just gonna
hurt you
really really bad
that's awful
don't forget we're the bad guys i know
this is heresy but i had a little
ghostbusters vibe
i was thinking of uh the end of
ghostbusters or the witch at the end and
all the
she gets like she gets like this this
she's the witch and she was like
petrified and then it's like
she peels her skin off and reminded me
he goes or dogs yeah yeah
and then i'm gonna open the portal i'm a
i'm an interdimensional
unstoppable creature and then so you got
this like ragtag group of like
people that are have all these different
weird abilities and they're like here
go stop this i was just wondering why
batman didn't show up
and try and help but batman does show up
in the movie yeah
he punches a woman in the face which is
sort of weird
i found that off-putting to see one of
the most famous superheroes of all time
just punching harley quinn right in the
face multiple women get punched in the
face in this movie
and now that i'm like like if it's
appropriate it makes sense but in this
movie it was weird
one time it's played for laughs that
slipknot character
that's another thing too is like after
we establish all these characters and
then it's like oh and here's another guy
and he gets out of a vehicle and just
punches a woman in the face
unlike ghostbusters which features three
white ladies who are academics
and a black lady who works in the subway
this film
was a very diverse collection of
characters we have
we have a latino man we have
a japanese woman we have a black man
we have a white lady yes we have an
australian
and we have uh and they're all led by an
african-american
female who's who's very powerful in the
government sure
it's it is that's all great but they're
all played as like really
simplistic stereotypes no there's no
there's no
racial stereotypes they're they're just
uh they're just
mostly bad people and and no one is
championing this film
as the model of cultural diversity as it
should be i mean yes they're all
villains
but that aside they're all bad guys and
stereotypes they
all do the right thing at the end which
is stop an intergalactic monster
that's awful oh there's an escape from
new york thing where they all have
capsules in their neck so they have to
do the mission
and then the what's that guy's name the
robocop remake guy
joel kinnaman who's on a great program
called
well he's the one that's in charge he
has the lady on it who played
uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh
uh so he uh he he smashed this really
great show
he smashes the device that will set up
these capsules so he's like all right
i'm sorry you guys can do whatever the fuck you want
and then immediately jai
courtney's character runs out
i was like oh that's funny he's just
abandoning them all but then he's just
in the next scene anyway
so there's lots of moments like that
where it's like oh they're going to do
something different nope
this is this is stupid but she has an
app on her phone
that has their little pictures oh yeah
and uh
and so that's what she uses as leverage
because all she has to do is touch their
picture touch screen yeah their head
blows up which they
demonstrated with a slip knot
and then she's like this back off, mother fuckers
you know
and her fingers are on her fucking phone
and i'm like if i were the guy on the
top row
i'm like you hold your phone like this
you know you get to get your fingers off
the top
i'm like who's doing this movie who's
making these movies
apparently nobody really a a group of
people in a
board room are making these movies and
panicking
and who is this movie made for jay
i have no fucking clue
there it was originally shot as a pg-13
and then there was talk of them doing
well they did do reshoots and there was
talk of the reshoots being to make it
r which it's not it's pg-13
lots of people get murdered in this
movie lots of people get shot and killed
there's no blood but it's very violent
there's lots of shooting
and the characters are you know they're
anti-heroes they're bad guys
so i don't know who the audience is for
it people with adhd
because it doesn't make any fucking sense
well, at our screening there i was wondering
this you know and at our screening there
was a lot of weirdos
um there was there was a a smell of pot
in the air there was a smaller pot in
the air but there they're also
like like weirdos you'd see like i don't
know
at like a like a dingy bar
or a rave or you know you know what i
mean like yeah it wasn't like your
typical like it wasn't comic book nerds
it wasn't comic book nerds not like the
overweight guy with with the
captain america shirt on and the big
beard and you know he was eating popcorn
it was like
like i don't know like weirdos came out
of the woodwork but yeah like
like all the tattoo parlors were empty
like it was just like i guess i can see
it based on the
marketing like it looks like it looks
like hot topic the movie
yes it looks like hop topic threw up all
over guardians of the galaxy
yes and that's the movie jared leto's uh
joker looked like
uh marilyn manson in the
the music video he was a scarface
juggalo
yeah i guess we should talk about jared
leto have you ever seen the marilyn
manson
cover of um tainted love yes
yeah yeah where he's he's goth gangsta
that's what it reminded me of but yeah
let's talk about jared leto
uh well he's barely in the movie for one
thing he's in about 10 minutes of the
movie
he has no connection to the plot he's
not in any scenes with anybody else
except for margot robbie
uh and he has a talk with the he a drug
dealer who
who he offers offers margot roby
as a sex slave to him and then and then
he says no and then he kills him
right was that a double cross what was
that scene the guy the guy acted
completely justified
he's like what happened no this is that
i don't have sex with
uh my girlfriend yeah and he's like i'd
like to
but but she's a lady so no yeah thank
you
yeah that was unclear but but my point
is that was a scene that happened that
made no sense
there was another scene where there's
the uh guard at the prison that's at
like a casino or whatever
yes and they drag him to the back room
and the joker says some things
and there's no connection to anything
what was that scene
i what i blew up with what i thought was
going to happen was
joe which which kind of happened there
it was brought up later but
the joker takes the guard in and and
basically says you're gonna let her out
of jail
but then then it's like then the the the
suicide squad team
led by viola davis come in and they take
margot robbie out
yeah and she's like i'm leaving now and
then he's the guard's like wait wait
wait a minute you know the uh
joke is gonna be mad at you and then
that was the end of it yeah it served
absolutely no purpose
maybe in the original cut of the movie
things made more sense i have no clue
well that's what every uh every film
goer needs to say
maybe it makes sense before they release
the movie they should put disclaimers
before these movies that say like
this movie did make sense at one point
in time
enjoy question mark this movie was
really good it made a whole lot of sense
and then we fucked it up and released it
because we got scared yeah and we're
constantly looking at other movies
instead of like having the balls to
release
a movie the way it was intended to be
released
we had committees and market research
people and
pre-screenings and and all these people
going this take this out this little
this you're saying you needed to do this
you need to do this
and those are questions or things that
were being said
after the movie was shot right and they
didn't have the nerve to release it
probably this is all uh speculation well
it's like fantastic four we'll never
know
we'll never we'll probably i mean maybe
this movie will get like they did the
batman v superman extended cut maybe
they'll do an extended cut of this and
it will make sense i don't know
um because it feels like a lot of this
is the result of reshoots too so it's
like if they do an extended cut will it
be
that original version before they did
that who knows
yeah it's all speculation yeah all i
know is that jared leto is the worst fucking joker ever
why did you say that he didn't even seem
like the joker he just seemed like
a slightly quirky thug yeah
i mean unless you're gonna spend a lot
of time on the character like
no the nolan movies did right where he
actually has something to do with the
story
that would be nice yeah yeah the joker
really should have like
he should have shown up at the end and
kind of like
foiled their plan to stop the bad guy by
you know it's doing something like yeah
or even the the final scene
of this movie well we don't get into
spoilers but
oh i mumbled spoilers hours ago okay i
guess
we don't care the movie sucks don't see
it so the end of the movie is is
everyone's back in prison uh and the
joker shows up and he breaks her out
like if that was the first time you saw
the joker
like a lead into a future movie maybe
that would work but
just having him be there at the
beginning of the movie in a
sloppily edited flashback that's not how
you introduce such an iconic villain
can we talk about the part where he
asked
uh harley quinn if she would die for him
and she said yes and then
she threw herself into a vat of a horse
semen
yeah i don't know was that to imply that
that weird chemical gave her some kind
of superpowers or
i have no fucking clue
i mean we know the jack nicholson joker
fell into a vat of chemicals and that's
what made him the joker bust his face
up so maybe that has some connection i
have no idea what that was supposed to
be because they showed her getting like
uh electroshock yeah treatment
um and that's what fucked her up mentally
uh but but uh uh
did she train with like a martial arts
master
what gave a average psychiatrist
psychologist
the ability to be like the kung fu
master
did we know that oh it was the power of
bad screenwriting
oh
is that that the superpower that that
turns your hair rainbow colored and
parted to the side
we've got you
come on back we're watching we're
watching um
uh pass through faster soon whenever
it's available pass through is my fourth
theatrical feature film but yeah like
i the second half of the movie i i
can't say that i hated it the second
half gets better there's still parts
that feel
truncated and rushed but it at least
feels like
a linear series of events that happen in
the order they're supposed to
yes as opposed to the first half which is a giant clusterfuck
yeah you don't feel any kind of like
forward momentum
like of of excitement like we got to
stop this
interdimensional monster yeah you just
you just sort of feel like you want to
shower it's exactly what you would
expect when a studio meddles with a
movie and just
does panic mode editing stop meddling
with the movies
if you're going to hire david ayer and
i'm sure he had a pitch
i said this is how i'm going to do it
then just let him do it
and this and don't listen to your test
audiences
yeah or just hire brett ratner or just
hire brett ratner and then like
he'll do whatever you want every phase
of the production have uh
marketing and uh pitch meetings and go
we're gonna tweak this you don't even
need a director you just need a
boardroom of executives like like
shouting orders from like
like a an ipad
behold the voice of god
so mike would you recommend a suicide
squad
just say no
you can do it
are the wheels turning of who to
recommend it to no not
really the wheels are turning because
because i didn't hate it uh
i i it it didn't have that like
like i hate you zack snyder you know you
obnoxious prick
this could have been good it it made me
hate all the
the higher ups yeah like and that's why
it was so frustrating to me i hated the
movie because
it was so clearly fucked with to the point of almost being incoherent for the first half
right
the first half is fucking terrible
the second half gets a little bit better
but by that point so much damage has
been done it's like i can't get into
this movie now
and then we have one nice scene where
they're all hanging out in a bar
that's the only scene in the movie that
i liked yeah
there's moments throughout the movie
that i liked but that's the only full
scene where it's like okay
i can see what they were probably going
for yeah it's not worth it for that
scene alone and now
and it's not like you could say well
there were a lot of funny moments
because it really weren't
it was very dark but i i don't know i
i i was somewhat aware of of the studio
meddling and
the problems and i was very curious to
see it
to kind of see watch on the screen like
okay that's from that that's wrong that
doesn't make
it almost like an analytical perspective
oh sure i i enjoyed it on that level
yeah and to watch
the uh the the hindenburg
the giant dc logo on it
oh the meta humanity
well one of the supporting roles in
suicide squad
a random government agent man is played
by actor david
harbour oh i see you're a big fan of his
i i'm a huge fan of david uh
harbor i've been following his work for
years
but in addition to suicide squad he is
also on the netflix series
stranger things you guys getting paid by
netflix now
yes oh i love checks
