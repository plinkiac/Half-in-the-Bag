MIKE (PLINKETT):
Half in the bag.

JAY:
You know, I don't think this has ever been plugged in.

MIKE:
Don't worry about that. I've got 180 bidders on my NFT. It's an ape wearing a top hat. I drew it in MS Paint. Oh! I sold my NFT of a monkey wearing a top hat for 185,000 dogecoins. Oh. Dogecoins just tanked in the stock market. Now it's worth nothing. Oh, wait. Now it's worth 140 million crypto coins. Wait a minute. Oh, no. Now it's worth nothing. Maybe I should just invest in the ruble. Anyway, what's going on in your life today, Jay?

JAY:
Oh, I thought we could talk about the new Roland Emmerich movie. And, you know, it's perfect timing because Will Smith just came out with that Independence Day remake.

CLIP:
Welcome to earth.

CLIP:
Oh, wow!

CLIP:
I've made a shocking discovery. I need you to get me in touch with NASA immediately.

MIKE:
Roalnd Emmerich's Moonfall is a movie no one noticed. But, Moonfall will become an important footnote in movie history as the nail in the coffin of an entire genre of film. The silent ending of a very loud and noisy era. I'm speaking of a time when your family and friends dragged you to the movie theater on opening weekend of a new big budget sci-fi disaster movie. The theater was crowded the sounds of crunching and talking were heard until the film started. Then the noise of the new, dumb, loud Roland Emmerich film drowned it all out. For two hours plus, you watched divorced dads and shoehorned-in dim-witted side characters stumble through a poorly written film about one epic disaster or another. After a few trips to the bathroom, the movie was over. Everyone filed out of the theater having a shared experience of a loud mind-numbing film. After dismal box office returns and an actual worldwide disaster -- the covid pandemic -- only a smattering of people are returning to the movie theaters. It's now mostly a place for parents to have their kids babysat for a few hours by Spider-Man, Free Guy, or a new Disney product. Grown-ass adults watch movies at home, and young adults and teens watch five-second tick tock videos on their phones. The 90's are long over. Ironically, one of the first films Roland Emmerich directed was a movie called Ghost Chase. Now he's the one chasing ghosts. So, Jay, you wanted to talk about Moonfall. I hate you. I think, I think, uh, this is, this is like weird revenge.

JAY:
Well, now we got Rich making you watch Picard. I'm making you watch, uh, Roland Emmerich movies.

MIKE:
Yeah, something's going on.

JAY:
Some, some, the, the tides are changing?

MIKE:
Tides are rising.

JAY:
The tides are -- look out, it's gravity!

MIKE:
It's the moon!

JAY:
Well, this was fascinating to me. I literally did not know this movie existed until yesterday. It's a movie, 140-million dollar Roland Emmerich, uh, disaster porn film. Big budget movie. And i had no idea it came into theaters. I never saw a trailer. I never heard a single person talk about it. I did a little research yesterday, and obviously some people reviewed it when it came out, but it was like, if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a make a sound? I had no idea this movie existed.

MIKE:
It's, it's the world we live in now and and
also probably the studio saw a turd smell the turd a mile away and didn't
want to pump in 100 more million dollars into marketing yeah i don't know what they spent on marketing but one
interesting thing i found out is that this was an independently financed movie this wasn't just one of the big studios
throwing money at roland emmerich i think those days are long gone uh he did independence day two big flop why did i
buy this box i guess he did a couple non-disaster
porn movies he did that stonewall movie yeah there's a a couple of different weird movies did the
the uh anonymous the movie about the guy that ghost wrote for shakespeare whatever the [ __ ] that was
i thought he did do you remember that john cusack movie where he plays edgar allan poe and it's like a like an action
thriller i saw that i assumed that was him because it was so stupid but i don't think he had anything to do with that movie
but uh yeah he so he made a couple changes in his usual formula no luck
came back to independence day flopped now he's got this thing which was independently financed it's like one of
the highest budgeted independent movies ever made and also one of the biggest flops of all
time 140 million dollar budget i think it made globally like 40 million
he owes the mob a lot of money apparently the like the final bit of investment to get the movie made came
from from china it was chinese money no kidding so there's that it's a big part
of this because i'm sure you notice the very standout actress
she i looked her up her name's one one you i'm assuming she's famous in china yeah okay she's uh she was born in
china in the early 2000s moved to canada so she's chinese canadian
she's like a pop star and her imdb has her being on a what looks like a chinese soap opera okay
so clearly a famous chinese face and so i whenever i see that because
they've done that they've re-cut like marvel movies and they've oh yeah they they do all sorts of [ __ ] for china yeah
that's why disney can get away with saying our first gay character in a disney movie like 17 times now right
they just cut it out of china and then everybody forgets because it's someone in the background but i was like okay
she's she's running around with uh patrick wilson's son i'm like oh they're going to get a
couple action scenes so they could edit her into the trailer a ton uh edit out all the black people and uh
but when i looked at uh box office mojo and i looked at the worldwide box office china wasn't listed at all
and then in the movie they woven into the plot they're referencing
like how the chinese space agency is helping our chinese friends are loaning us
and i'm like if there was some kind of disaster china wouldn't help at all they would they would keep to themselves
and figure out a way to make the make the situation work for them i'm like that's [ __ ] interesting um
so there's several lines about how the chinese are assisting first they go up the first attempt to go to the moon is the
with the european space agency then that fails and then china helps with with a
couple things here and there our friends in china are helping so very clearly pandering to the chinese
market so that makes sense about the i didn't even know about the investment that's yeah but i wanted to bring that up that's interesting along with
kaspersky viral virus protection software
what are you talking about eagle eye jay is now going to call you
blind as a bat jake okay i'm eagle i'm mike they're driving through the streets or they're going to a building and the
water's coming in i did see this i didn't think anything of it that's a conspiracy how do you say
it conspiracy i have no idea but uh it's a it's a anti-viral protection internet protection software company like a
mcafee or whatever yeah um and there's a billboard prominently advertising it and then when um
the not simon pegg character the nerd science nerd guy he's apparently on game of thrones yeah he's
um he's logging into the computer to like do some kind of calculation or something
and it says system protected by kaspersky virus protection on the screen well that's where some of that budget
came from china and anti-viral software well you get the money where you can
movies are so magical well these kind of movies well that's this is like yeah i said
nail in the coffin that was the weird thing watching it is that it just felt so dated like how has
roland emrick made the exact same movie for two decades now and all those shots you see you know
they have the the text at the bottom of the screen saying where they're at we go from one location to another we got the
the father and his estranged son which that was [ __ ] weird we're not he doesn't have a single conversation with
his son until over an hour into the movie we got two divorced dads yeah i really miss you
i miss you too my little man we never made it to dad that's okay we have two divorced dads we
got two different children separated from their parents two different estranged sons from different
age groups that son by the way that whole subplot because he's in the subplot with the the chinese actress
they go off and they have their own little side plot and he was so bad just saw him clear you're gonna take a bomb
into space and why are you even here you hate nasa i had to look him up i was like is this some sort of like
musician is this like stunt casting like he was in the clovich killer well that's what i looked about i was like oh this
the kid the main kid from the clovis killer i remember being good in that i don't know what happened he was younger then i'm sorry it didn't work out story
of my life thanks for getting me out of jail
he was checked out for being a young actor like up and coming young actor
i i think he's he that young man is wise beyond his years because he's probably
he's probably like i want to get i want to be the next uh timothy chalamet you know i i wanted and
then they're like all we can get you is this roland emmerich movie and he's like fine i'll do it
then he's like yeah we gotta get the car thank you for getting me out
i know it wasn't always easy mike the character's supposed to be angry he's angry at his dad he's a troubled teen he
steals a car at one point i have nothing but the respect for him
for throwing his performance the old pros halle berry patrick wilson both
established actors they've made their money this is this is a paycheck performance sure with
with probably producer credits back end a good you know
that didn't work out too well it didn't work out well for them but they're there and they're halle berry's emotion like this is acting at its finest when you
see this a script that's just so awful and these scenarios that are just so
mind-numbingly dumb and unrealistic um and you see halle berry like crying
and giving you know she's a pro oh sure patrick wilson pro they're they're sitting in their little spaceship flying
around and they're delivering their lines like they should but that kid he knew
he knew he knew what he was in he knew that it wasn't really going to advance his career
he wants to do better smarter things better movies and this is all his agent could get him
they said it's a great deal you're just gonna have to run around in front of a green screen for a little bit
sit in a car for a couple of scenes just say look out gravity look out you can handle it yeah you can handle it and so
he he's just like no through gritted teeth i'm i'll do it
then everyone else is trying and you know that's their job well the other son in the movie i don't want to harp on him
too cause he's just a little kid but let's just show a clip and we'll just leave it at that okay we're all gonna be
safe with dad in colorado are you sending the rockets to the moon i don't want you to go i love you
more than all the stars in the sky even more than the whole milky way
way more i don't want you to go
talk about this film right this is what we're here to do that's what we're here to do i mean
this is a where do you start situation so i'm not even gonna in terms of like complaining about how dumb
the dialogue is the logic of it the reality well it's all the usual roland emmerich stuff the interesting thing is
that he usually has his one premise and that's the movie 2012 the day after tomorrow earth is freezing
in that one look out we gotta run from cold
close the door this one it's look out we gotta run from the gravitational pull of the moon but then he slaps on three or
four other bad movie ideas onto it like the last act of this movie is one of the
worst things i've ever seen like just the moon coming towards earth and it's [ __ ] up a gravitational pull
it's causing floods like that's your idea that's your movie but then you throw on like ai nanobots
that are trying to destroy the universe this is this is just your standard
roland emmerich movie but like you said a couple of layers extra and the premise is
patrick wilson paley berry or space astronauts and they're talking about the lyrics to toto's africa what does it even mean to
miss the rains down in africa the lyrics are i bless rains down in africa
no they're not we all wondered what the lyrics were as i i blessed the rains down in africa i didn't know that was so
i didn't know this was like a mandela effect thing i thought everyone knew that's what the lyrics were yeah this movie gaslighting us but it's it's
actually not rains like rains like it's raining e that's
g n s rains like horse reigns
although i don't think astronauts when they're on eva walks like doing repair work i don't
think they chit chat you gotta humanize you gotta humanize the characters the opening of the movie i'm not gonna complain about that because there's so
much more to complain about in terms of reality but the premise is a
a thing from the end of the matrix films right thousands of nanobots is in sentient ai
life form we don't know that's what it is at this we don't until the exposition dump at the end
but we'll get to that robot it's exhausting just thinking about it in 2011 the robot finally makes
its way to earth flies past patrick wilson's spaceship space shuttle and then bores a hole way down into th
center of the moon 11 years later it takes 11 years for it to bore down to the center 10 years
whatever and then it it's then it knocks the moon up gravitational and then
and then they have a scene in nasa where the head of nasa comes in the director
and there's a screen that shows the earth and the moon and the normal moon's rotation
and then there's a big red line that shows that it's degrading and then the head of nasa says what am i
looking at here can someone tell me what the hell i'm
looking at i don't know ask your five-year-old son it's very clear on the screen and i laughed
and so the moon's orbit is deteriorating which has an escalating effect of disastrous
results of course the tides are brought about by the gravity of the moon so the tides get worse flood scenes
then the moon gets closer and then pieces of it i think because of the gravitation of the earth are pulling
chunks of the moon away yeah and then there's just like billions of pieces of the moon like hitting the earth
and um most of them are burning up in the atmosphere as like meteors
uh and then towards the end it's just like batshit crazy with the amount of like rocks that are hitting like a rock
less than like a mile wide would just devastate the earth for 10 generations like it
would wipe out all life on the planet earth if an asteroid the size of new york city hit the earth
i suppose you can argue that the rocks coming from the moon aren't hitting the earth as hard so they might not kick up
as much dust in the atmosphere there's all sorts of scientific are they the [ __ ] up gravitational pulls making
them hit slower and lighter than they would yeah i don't know maybe maybe asteroids
have been have a higher rate of speed i mean i'm the the science in this
it's safe to say is probably not completely accurate especially the part where they they they
launch the space shuttle with three working engines and halle berry just launches it herself by hitting a start
button oh yeah after telling everyone to evacuate everybody go home we've completely given up we gotta go
got to launch this puppy i'm just going to hit this button there's not like a team of 3000 people that are involved in
launching a space shuttle and all its complex components this is an old space shuttle it's a simpler technology okay
yeah okay um but anyway crackpot guy there's a crackpot theory guy who's the usual
character isn't quite as obnoxious and annoying as previous roland emmerich character well that's something i wanted
to point out he always has the dumb comic relief side characters and that's essentially the function the game of
thrones guy plays but yeah they tone down the comedy so much that it throws everything off balance ironically enough
where the movie feels way more dour than his movies usually do like it's not i mean i don't think any of his movies are
fun but the fun that people have with like independence day or something is completely missing from this all right
you alien [ __ ]
well because halle berry and um uh patrick wilson aren't aren't likable
they're just sort of like blah kind of characters they're not a wizzle smith they're professionals yeah
yeah they're not a will smith keep my wife's name out your [ __ ] mouth oh my
god oh my god or harvey fierstein or any like they don't have a lot of
personality i guess the personality was supposed to be put into the not simon pegg character
fuzz aldrin how many times have i told you to use the litter box i guess it's like ah he has
a cat and they do make a joke at one point they're about to launch into space the only people left at nasa is halle
berry patrick wilson and him so he has to go on the spaceship with him and they make jokes about him having ibs
i've got ibs irritable bowel syndrome and really you know
a lot of people suffer from ibs maybe jada pinkett has ibs i don't know
you know we have to protect her at all costs we should not be making jokes such a debilitating problem that many
people face he says he has anxiety too yeah anxiety is not a joke it's not he's
constantly popping pills you know what that's not funny no don't be making jokes about these things funny it's not
funny i think that's why this movie flopped um but getting back to the plot
mike it's not funny i know it's not funny i wasn't laughing we can't get past this part we gotta get this
trending on twitter hashtag hashtag cancelmoonfall although i guess that happened when it was
released in theaters
moon fail and fail moon crash we'll talk about moon crash
we'll get to moon crash we'll talk about the copy cat moon crash and a different film in a minute but uh
there's the uh not just the moonland people thinking the moon landings are fake conspiracy
crackpots right uh there's goofballs that think of uh
the moon is a megastructure it's doing something to the megastructure's power excuse me
please don't ask when they see a blurry nasa image from 150 million light years
away and it's a blurry thing they think it's a mega structure which is some kind of
alien-built gigantic thing and like there's that asteroid that happened to look like a long spaceship
people were thinking it was a spaceship and i'm like that's just a weird shaped asteroid
let's go with occam's razor here um but like when people look at a photo and they see an orb and they're like that's
a ghost and i'm like that's not a ghost idiot ghosts aren't real that's a
dust a piece of dust that when you take a picture and you flash the dust that's near the lens
blurs out yeah because it's not focused because it's right near the lens yeah anyways uh so there's a there's a
concept in science fiction called a dyson sphere which i had heard before and i'm assuming i've heard it from you in
relation to star trek correct i i i would be i would be be crucified on the internet
if if i did not mention the dyson sphere episode of star trek the next generation uh and and a witch had scottie in it oh
scotty james duhan james duhan um uh this was before he died oh okay not
after okay i should have known it's a fictional idea
where you could build a sphere around a star
and then inside of the sphere absorb all the stars energy for yourself
lock it in i an actual dyson sphere can you imagine the engineering skills
needed to even design such a structure yeah i know it's pretty amazing to to either have
living space on the inside use it for power whatever in star trek the next generation there's a sun
like like a yellow middle-aged kind of sun like our sun okay which is obviously
[ __ ] gigantic now imagine building a sphere around that sure with enough space to be far
away from the sun i mean you're talking 175 quadrillion times the size of the
death star i mean we're talking the big which is why it's fictional so like the death star from the force awakens it's
bigger this is starkiller base so it's big maybe 175 quadrillion times
bigger than that death star okay bigger than the moon would be is what you're saying jay do you know how big our sun
is right so bigger than the moon bigger than the moon but but
here's here's the caveat yes inside our moon's dyson sphere which is obviously a
very tiny dyson sphere is a white dwarf star there's there's
there's regular stars like our our sun or stars that are bigger stars end their
lives in a couple of different ways right they turn into red giants in about five
to six billion years the sun will eat all of the inner planets of our solar system and will reach the earth's orbit
thus entering the red giant phase the red giant phase of a star will onlY
last a few hundred million years before it runs out of fuel completely and
becomes a white dwarf a star gets smaller and smaller and turns into something called a white dwarf
which is compressed now science has discovered
the smallest white dwarf that exists which is which contains about the mass of our sun
but is about the size of the moon okay which compared to the mass of our sun is [ __ ] tiny
that's like taking let's say a city bus okay and shrinking it to the size of the head of a pin
okay i might not be right with that i'm just guessing uh so the biggest the smallest white
dwarf they found was about the size of the moon okay the movie has a little bit of leeway they're saying the the there's an even
smaller white dwarf inside this yeah this must be the hull of the mega structure
the moon's mantle's just a protective shell and that's what they built their dyson sphere around and on the outside
of that dyson sphere is the moon's surface all the dirt and
you know craters and all that so it's hidden inside there yeah and we discover at the end of the film that the plot was
humans somewhere else in the galaxy they had a.i their ai just suddenly
Decided to come alive the ai suddenly became self-aware
remember it's in that little girl's bedroom i thought i was missing something i watched that twice and i was i rewound it i was like what am i
missing why does it just start attacking but it just does just because it's amazing i'm self-aware
the ai certainly became self-aware and when somebody becomes self-aware just immediately wants to murder everything
well their ai that they had on their alien planet was um you know the the the equivalent of
rosie the robot and the jetsons sure if rosie tucks me in and tells me about the cow that they gravitated over the moon
yes i got it here too in the form of i guess i should say more modern uh a
google alexa i'll say a more modern version of that okay in the form of of
nanobots that float around and form shapes yeah and she had hers inside a little little tri a little pyramid which
i assume was like an alexa nanobots you know put on
uh put on the jersey shore yes sir yes i will put on the jersey
shore bleep um and then they got mad and they broke out of their little thing and then they met with
other blobs of nanobots that are flying around and that became a big swarm and
transformed into countless swarms of nanotechnology
nanotechnology killed everyone on the planet destroyed all their stuff and then left
to go conquer the universe to go destroy other planets then it made it to earth it burrowed its way inside our moon
and heliberry says some line where she says it's like killing two birds with one stone because not simon pegg asked sir why didn't it
just come down and kill all the people and they're like well if it [ __ ] drops the earth the moon on the earth it
would kill it would do two things it would kill two birds with one stone that was the plot yes
but the nanobot monster thing is only attracted to it can only sense technology technology
plus organic
if there's just technology it doesn't detect it but if there's technology with like a person there that's what it detects it's like the end of the matrix
remember the end of the matrix but they had to walk around the robot suits and shoot out the things yeah yeah
and the nanobots would detect that and the only way they could stop those is with the emp same thing that's the same thing yeah
that's right they recently used it in star trek picard oh to turn off the engine of the homeland
security bus and then rafi kicks the door open to the bus and uses the emp on the driver
and it knocks it off now here people are typing already yeah but human beings do run on an electrical
component yeah we have an electrical component within our bodies okay so perhaps an emp would knock a person out
although from what every everything i've heard the theories of in an emp attack on the united states
they never mentioned anything about it knocking everybody out they just knock out all of our power grids and internet
and satellites and all that kind of stuff so yeah i don't i don't have the answer to that some typo who's typing comments right now might know whether or
not an emp would knock a person out i don't know if it would kill them emp interference is generally disruptive or
damaging to electrical equipment and at higher energy levels a powerful emp event such as a lightning strike can
damage physical objects such as buildings and aircraft structures the main impact is electrical energy that
doesn't kill people but spreads like lightning striking any electrical grid or circuitry
they have the emp oh god they take the space shuttle up and then they have a little space
shuttle rover it's a little engine attached to it that probably has enough like fuel to
like get them down to the moon for like four minutes
but in this it's flying around like a star trek space shuttle zoo it's like star wars
ludicrous mode this doesn't make any sense
uh they have the emp bomb on their ship and then the the robot attacks them and they're like oh god it's noticing the
electronics so he smashes the controller that still works later yeah because it has to because it has to
uh but then they get sucked inside the the dyson sphere and then the the alien
technique form
that lives inside the dyson sphere decides to help them out there's some kind of consciousness it
can project images from your subconscious which is why all the exposition is dumped by
uh patrick wilson's son when he was still a little kid i'm a construct from your minds
billions of years ago your ancestors were once a surviving civilization from the distant possible
galaxies
it's just like blanket exposition it's a story about fathers and sons yeah it becomes contact at the end that's
rolling emery's whole thing isn't it he always takes these ideas from other better movies and just dumbs them down
to make theoretically a crowd pleaser you're supposed to be cheering during
that amazing uh aspen car chase scene oh my god which had some of the worst [ __ ] effects that i've ever seen in a
big movie like this well for first we see patrick wilson arrive at the griffith observatory in los angeles well
he arrives at a green screen he's green-screened yeah it looks like the room yeah it's uh
lucky for me i mean i think they filmed inside there because it looks similar unless they built a set that looked just
like it but it looked like the real place looks like the real place but uh yeah they couldn't get them riding up on a motorcycle maybe they figured that we
all need this for one shot we'll just do it on a green screen we don't need to get patrick wilson there that day who knows save some of that 140 million
dollars china backed out uh 75 bucks from the budget they gave us so we just got to cut cut a corner here
but uh oh god those redneck the one guy looks like a hillbilly and a half straight out of a yeah like a 70s
grindhouse movie or something he looks like the the neighbor in the burbs
hey pinocchio where are you going but they're like
where are we going i guess i guess they were all like this all flew over my head but they're
all trying to get oxygen tanks i didn't understand why they were chasing them at first i thought they were just mad
because they have kind of a confrontation where they're trying to steal their [ __ ] and then they they take off and the
they start chasing them i was like the earth is about to be destroyed who cares but then i guess they were yeah trying to get their oxygen they make a
reference to the the rednecks rob a gas station he's like look at all this money i got and he's like we could use it as toilet paper it's worthless yeah and the
real the real thing we need now are oxygen tanks because when the moon comes super close
and the moon was like like scraping up against the earth yes and so that that
sucked all the air up temporarily it only affects the gravitational pull in a very small region though even though
it's that close to the earth so to the point where you can run from the gravitational right the moon is is the
the orbit of the earth is just cluttered with billions of chunks of the moon
like planet killer asteroids the and and it's scraping up against the
earth and then there's things like they're in colorado right yeah because that's the highest elevation in the u.s
yeah um and so they're like walking outside and they're like and then like this giant meteorite hits
a mountain how did you get out dad got me out and
it explodes and then they go hmm and i'm like you ever hear uh [ __ ]
avalanches and [ __ ] like like and and and one hit like that would just
cover you with with zero visibility dust yeah for like seven years okay
whatever well every time they cut to the moon like looming over the horizon it happens multiple times and people are
like look out it's the moon like it's like it's jason voorhees or something yeah i mean it'd be pretty
scary if the moon got that close it would be sure i think if the moon moved like one
degree of rotation the whole earth would just die they say they're like like climate change if the
if the earth changes temperature degrees by like two degrees in the next 20 years like we're all [ __ ] yeah like the
whole ecosystem of the year like it's so delicate and then you just have this this insane
[ __ ] going on where the moon's scraping the earth's atmosphere and then they're just like running and oh god the sunny
and the the chinese actress when they're running remember and then there's the bridge
and then like there's like a like a truck flying at them oh yeah and then a train is flying at them and they're just
like running on their little green screen yeah and then they jump because the bridge collapses they jump and then like
the wind pushes them into the into the safety of this there's multiple scenarios in this movie where they say
the gravity is helping
moon is going to us us i think that's the light i wrote it down and rolling emmerich put a couple lines
up while making this movie oh [ __ ] the moon is rising gravity's
going to go crazy oh dead the moon is rising gravity's
going to go crazy yeah i i i just want to return to that
amazing car shootout yeah michael pena he's sticking out the side window and
he's shooting at him and it's just all green screen and it looks awful it's like we were talking about with that uh
bruce willis movie where they just add all the plug-in effects there's a snow and [ __ ] like they're
trying to conceal how bad it looks by just throwing every every uh element in front of the frame right
right this the the kind of sunset and the moon in the background and there's just so many layers of things
going on to where it shattered that illusion of reality
this felt like a big tv show you ever see commercials for that that show called 9-1-1
like oh yeah it's like the most ridiculous like circumstances arise
it's just like we're dealing with the most crazy [ __ ] that could possibly
happen and uh some of those like effects they look kind of similar in quality
of a roland emmerich film so that's why this is like this is a ship that sailed it's cheap
shitty tv shows can have the same level of effects well speaking of we mentioned
moon crash earlier which is the mockbuster version of this there's a couple i watched some of it
there's a couple of effect shots and this is an asylum movie that looked really good
as good as moonfall a lot of the other ones are awful but there was a couple of shots that didn't
look bad they they probably put a ton of money towards a couple of shots to put them in the trailer yeah well
you'll show those shots of course of course of course and i'll also show the the shitty shots because there's plenty of those too
we have to get out of here no no come on right now get inside why not that's why
i don't know if the i think the premise of that one was like some mining accident shot rocks down from the moon
yeah that's i watched uh just it was just a more favorable plot to me that's keep it simple like the whole nanobots
and the the ancient civilization living inside the moon like they had all this crap but
yeah i watched the first 10 minutes of moon fall and then because it's an asylum movie i knew that the middle chunk of the movie
was just going to be like three or four little sets where characters just talk endlessly so i scrubbed to the end to see any sort of
exciting action climax special effects and there really wasn't much they're trying to change
there's like a whole row of solar panels outside they're like we have to change the direction of the solar panels and
that'll somehow deflect the moon i don't know what's happening if we turn the solar panel area
all in the same direction but the control panel to turn all the solar panels they didn't even alter at
all they just used a control box for a like a like a led light
literally this same one that we have it's for the this isn't promo but it's for the aputure uh 300c light she just
grabs it and she starts turning the dials on it they put gaff tape over the logo and that was it there's like a
calculator sitting on a piece of uh plywood and that's a piece of technology
it's so cheap it's actually shocking because the silo movies i didn't even know they were still making them but
they're still doing those mockbusters and it looks even worse than some of the older ones that i've seen
it was truly amazing but the interesting thing a lot of the dialogue and the like setup
of what's happening in the movie not dissimilar at all to the dialogue in moonfall
not it's just like moonfall is just as bad of dialogue as a uh an asylum
knockoff i don't know how we're going to stop this thing but we got to do everything that we can to get off this rock and help them save earth or there
isn't going to be a home to get back to the largest neo was already set to annihilate the entire planet a nuclear
fallout of this magnitude what small chance we had of saving this earth will
be non-existent i was talking to um our canadian friend colin
he sent me a text and he said i'm watching moonfall and it's [ __ ] hilarious i'm
laughing at everything in it and so i looked up the trailer for it but i accidentally watched the trailer
for moonshot with cole sprouse how long have you guys been together eight years eight years
how did you manage that he checks all the boxes oh you mean literally i was like it looks looks pretty bad it looks
like a fake movie yeah but i'm like like colin why are you watching this this looks like it's like like a why a novel adaptation it looks
like it's made for like pre-teen girls why are you watching this and he's like he's like it's rolling
emirates new movie i'm like saying what turn you the number
extracting this and then i put the pieces together what are you doing here who sneaks onto
spaceships i can explain so currently in release is moonshot moonfall
and moon crash yes which one uh made the most money at the box office
moonfall are the two that weren't even released in theaters they probably still did better they probably still did better yeah yeah oh by the way everyone
this is steve sawyer his team of international astronauts including his brother logan are stranded in a ship on
the moon we saved the earth
we should get started get started with what
at the very last line is you're part of the moon now oh that's the other thing there's a there's a sequel or maybe
cinematic universe bait he already tried that with the end of uh independence day too take the fight to them when do we
leave we're gonna kick some serious alien ass
i don't remember much of that movie but i remember it ends with sequel bait i'm like we're gonna keep doing this nope
but he thought moonfall that would be the one it could have been some kind of like because i mean you look at the earth and
it's like [ __ ] he saved the world
there's no way like the global economy is going to recover from it's going to just be
like a nightmare world for the next 200 years of people scavenging for food and
killing each other post-apocalyptic but i think it was either sql bait or a
tease that not simon peg man is
uh going to be the the ai that controls the moon and and the
moon already demonstrated that it has the technology to repair stuff because it like used its lasers to like fix
their broken shuttle so i think his his job as the moon overseer
is to shoot lasers down and fix all the cities so i think there's like
a little little twinkle of hope at the end that that the earth could be fixed okay
like i said in my intro the days of we're all going to the movies to watch this new release
are long dead and that's why this uh moon fall movie feels like like
like a walking corpse like it's it keeps trying to like climb up out of its grave and keep kicking it down
well that's why it's interesting that all now it's all about like with the the comic movies it's all about the multiverse stuff because that's a way t
drag back things you remember and like they're bringing back michael keaton batman they brought back sophie mcguire
spider-man all these things it's like the last gasp and it's not that theaters are dying
because like spider-man was like the third highest grossing movie of all time which is crazy
but if that was just another spider-man sequel it didn't have that angle of bringing back things you remember fro
20 years ago would it have been as big of a hit i don't know kind of like the new announcement about
season three as star trek they haven't even finished season two look what we got he paid attention
you know what i'm talking about right well they're bringing back everybody from tng yeah except for will wheaton
our first uh first two seasons with a wacky oddball characters
it's not working out bring them back bring everybody back i just saw that and i just said said to
myself how sad well this this moon fall kind of
feels like a genre version of that we're bringing back disaster porn it's back everybody
you're shooting at us well you think that an idea like this that he couldn't get any sort of funding
from a studio to make to the point where he had to independently finance it i guess in a way that's kind of admirable
because it's like maybe he really just wants to make these type of movies he's not completely cynical but yeah it's
like no one wants this [ __ ] anymore clearly it's it's stuff he wants to make
it's he really enjoys disaster porn he loves watching
cities get crumbled that's his thing but this is like a more generic version of that like in the older movies it's
like oh you see the white house get blown up or you see you know new york city get destroyed here's just like uh
here's a flood of a city there's not like no big landmarks that get destroyed the landmark things out of this and and
it's no there's no um message about you know current day politics like climate change or anything like that
it's just a sci-fi story of aliens in the moon and you know
it's so it's a little different than that there's no angle there's no like big shocking moments of watching the statue of liberty fall over
yeah
and all this kind of stuff
that type of spectacle in like the days of independence day it's like wow look at these amazing special effects
now we're at a point like we said tv shows have the same level special effects
nobody cares
we're in a fluctuation period where things are going to sink or swim
and uh moonfall has sunk
just like will smith and ezra miller's careers
yeah
when they talked about a dyson sphere i said star trek
there's even a shot in star trek the next generation where the enterprise flies through a doorway that's closing
hmm
which happens in this movie
oh
that's that's a pretty standard uh
yeah
action cliche though
and i said a dyson sphere
a dyson sphere has a star in the middle of it
the moon is way too small to have star in it
mm-hmm
and then they mentioned that it's probably a white dwarf
and i said oh a white dwarf at the center of this little dyson sphere inside the moon
that's pretty great
hmm
i'm really excited to see kenny baker again on big on the big screen
then i realized he had passed
yeah yeah
hey the game of thrones guy is in it
i figure maybe then it could be peter dinklage
oh yeah yeah
right
oh my god
will smith's coming to slap me
jada pinkett's fucking peter dinklage too
i've gone too far in a few places jay
possibly possibly
but that's what people come to come to see on half in the bag
oh
and they come to see me trying to mine for cryptocurrency
oh, god
i did it
i did it
that's okay
i can control our computer with this
okay
beep boop bwoop
bzzzzch
ahh
1/14th of a cent
i'm rich
