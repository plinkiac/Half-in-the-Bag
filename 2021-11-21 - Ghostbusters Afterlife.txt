half in the bag the only thing as i was watching is like if he shows up in the movie as a ghost at one point and they
have a touching this trailer makes makes the tone feel more sappy than ghostbusters has ever been it's doing
that wistful thing if he shows up as a ghost to give his daughter some closure because they were estranged which is the
vibe i get from the trailer that they didn't know egon very well if they do that then i'm gonna barf in
my lap
well guys we're back in the void but but what about the ongoing mr
plinkett storyline will will you ever get the antibodies from mr plinkett's blood
rich this is a very special episode of half in the bag where we are not playing our characters despite jay wearing his
vcr repair shirt for some reason that's very confusing only you and i don't know whether or not he's j or j
he's jay okay only you and i wore appropriate shirts
no i'm just here for the booze i'm wearing this so i look like the empty shell of my former character
it's appropriate also jay that we're in the black void last time the three of us were here together was after watching
star wars episode 10
rise of skywalker's lightsaber and that's the last film that we saw in
the theaters yeah i'm very upset because like this is the first time i've had let's talk about
ghostbusters afterlife that was the cue to read the intro you start talking about the movie
can you be any dumber
ghostbusters afterlife is the latest entry in our continuing collective pop culture equivalent of the chris farley
show you remember in something wild when melanie griffith had you handcuffed to
the bed remember that remember when you're with the beatles remember chris farley do you remember the ghostbusters
you love ghostbusters but more importantly you love the idea of loving ghostbusters remember twinkies
remember the stay puft marshmallow man remember the nestle's crunch bar that bill murray handed harold ramus in the
throwaway improvised gag remember who you're going to call remember gozer remember the fireman's pole hey does
this pole still work remember the terror dogs remember the terror dog statue remember the terror dog's arms ripping
through a chair remember evo shandor remember the stacked books you're right no human being would stack books like
this remember spores mold and fungus remember revelation 6 12. remember revelation 7 12. remember looking at map
exposition remember main characters in jail remember the eyeball ghost toy from the cartoon remember there is no dana
only zuul remember literally the entire third act of the first movie i love the 80s hey remember cocaine
cocaine was one of the key creative ingredients in putting together the original an ingredient that is sadly missing from ghostbusters afterlife
resulting in a movie aimed exclusively at babies and adult babies that think i love ghostbusters is a substitute for a
real personality because nostalgia is the new cocaine everyone that has seen it says that they
cry at the movies so it should be an extremely successful comedy
you know what i've i've uh i've reached that final stage of grief acceptance
i was thinking about that during this and i'm just like um no no
and i feel like talking about why this the original was so good and
why they keep screwing up sequels is just literally beating a dead horse
and this is a conversation we probably would have been really excited to have about 20 years ago
but now it's it's like like literally a shell of something that
only people over 40 remember and it's now some kind of new
twisted weird version of itself that isn't even worth our
wasting our breath on well the goal is to bring in the younger audience and introduce them to the world of
ghostbusters that's why we had 45 minutes of remember this schmaltz at the end yeah at the end
that's the whole movie no there are not characters in this movie there are pawns there are people
there are figures that are put in place to go from scene to scene to discover something from the original film there
are literal pawns and there are literal pawns in the movie too but there's yeah a scene of oh she discovers the pke
meter none of these characters have any personality outside of i mean i guess the main girl like her performance is
pretty good given what she had to work with she was the best part of the movie oh yeah she's fine flynn wolfhard has
nothing to do he has no he has no arc he's just like there because he was into stranger
things and when you do a thing with kids it's 80s nostalgia well you need the stranger
things kids right yeah there's there's uh yeah there's a bit of marketing involved in it he had a giant
character arc and that was to shoot the ghostbusters gun at the electrical towers at the end he understood science
that's what happened i thought he just randomly decided to shoot the thing i think the ghostbusters proton pack
became a like a all-purpose tool at the end well it's like i mean we've talked about lightsabers and the overuse of
lightsabers i want to mention this before i forget i know when the force awakens came out we
were relatively positive on it and hindsight is 20 20. uh and i think now that movie being as
successful as it was is the worst thing that could have ever happened to hollywood yeah this is exactly the force awakens
down to the third act being the exact same thing from the original movie well that's the thing is like
you know we didn't like the 2016 ghostbusters not many people did yeah and that was a carbon copy of the
original like beat for beat you know all the four characters they all get together and you know it was basically the same movie but it was like it was
like a very vague it was as cynical as like the the you know the first one where it's like kind of commenting on
capitalism and um uh consumerism the franchise rights
alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams that one was like remaking the first one just not funny
and then and then you have this one and you're like i don't know i i like any man-child have thought about what would
you do for a ghostbusters three as long as 30 years now right what would you do you know and i was
like okay and it kind of happened in the in the post-credit thing right where like the f what makes the first one funny and
we've discussed this to death is that they're they're the cynical schlubby guys right and that's the funny funny
bit those characters and how they interact with it it's a play on uh uh uh exterminators five thousand dollars i
have no idea to be so much i won't pay it well that's right we can just put it right back in their thing oh we certainly can dr venkman
no it's just a joke it's a gag movie right and and um
and then the second one was was not great same movie again just with
a different villain it's your classic 80s sequel same movie again and then it's done
right then you say what do you what do you do when you come back for a ghostbusters 3. do you bring them back are they too old now you know say if
this was like late 90s early 2000s are they too old is it funnier if they're older and they're
more schlubby yes suck in the guts guys were the ghostbusters i've always felt that but i rescind that
after seeing this movie because it just felt pathetic maybe that's partially the writing and they're not in it that much
but the last half an hour this movie was the most sad pathetic thing i've ever seen
in my entire manipulative which we'll get into yeah this movie is at its best
when it goes away from the ghostbusters one formula it's best when you don't have just the needless references little
girl discovering her grandfather and what he did that's good stuff i like that there's a couple parts like when she i
mean remember the fire pole she goes down the fire pole and finds like his secret little lab it's a movie about
ghostbusters 30 years after the fact i yeah magical moment when you discover ecto-1 that's fine i'm fine with that no
the the part that i agree with you on is when she's down there though and she's looking around and it's like egon's spirit is kind of guiding her and
there's like a light that kind of moves to point her to different directions in the room it's like okay
it's not funny ghostbusters is a comedy but at least it's like something they're doing something different this i i
didn't care if this was a comedy or not not really if this is just gonna be a fun kid adventure movie i'd be fine with
that didn't need to be a laugh-a-minute riot didn't need to follow the formula the first one at all no i didn't need to follow the formula the first one but it
at least needed to be engaging in some way and that's the thing is like all the characters fall flat except the girl i
guess the little girl because she's trying to discover things about her grandfather and it's like i don't know
kind of works well that's the thing is i agree the first
75 of the movie until there's a very clear shutoff point
my brain turned off my interest just stopped and that's the walmart
when you cut to walmart and paul rudd goes into walmart for no reason to buy baskin robbins
i don't think there's there's a walmart that clean in the entire universe okay with nobody in it no disgusting that's
the thing i want to mention about the whole thing there's nobody anywhere uh yeah you go to this one clearly it's
endorsed by walmart they have a cross promotion of some kind i have no idea and it's a clean ass walmart which
doesn't exist since only in science fiction that that doesn't make your skin crawl walking through it right and it's
perfect and paul wright is like i'd like to buy products that are sold in walmart and then the stay puft mini stay puft
marshmallow man characters come out of the bag and it's like i at that that gear shift from like it
was like a like a indie drama remember when ghostbusters 3 was a depressing indie drama that is
directed by jason reitman so until it until it gear shifted into a schmaltzy
nightmare that's what it was and then it felt like they they test screened it and they're
like okay the scene where paul paul rudd is is working on his seismograph in his home office right and then goes or
kidnaps them they all they said that that was too boring so then and then walmart came in on the last minute and
designed it and so they scrapped that and reshot the scene baby yoda was popular hey how about baby marshmallow
men we could sell a ton of those it was dripping with cynicism and and and it was just like gross
but but up leading up to that you know i like carrie hi like i wish she's a good actor i wish
she would drink more alcohol i wish she was more a more comical version of herself i loved how she was so like
like like gross and and stupid and and she couldn't take care of her own
children and then when paul rudd asks her what her father did she's like i don't know science whatever he's like
like a physicist i don't care is there booze around like i love that that was like that
little cynical nugget that i wanted in everything um what is her character doing though i
mean she's just kind of that my problem with that character she's just there like i said she's upon to become she's a
pawn to be yeah because the third act is the third act of the first movie she's keymaster and the gatekeeper she's not
looking for a job to get her family out of the debt thing she's scum
she's not doing things like i'm oh i'm worried about my child so i'm going to try and do this to better my child she's
just there yeah because she's egon's daughter and she's sad
danny potts tells her that the house is worthless and they're in debt and she's just like ah yeah they don't have that scene where
she sits the kids down the dining room table and says finn wolfhard you got to get a job at the burger joint um to help
pay you know for the the bills here i'm going to go try to i'm going to dust off my my associate's degree in in typing
and i'm going to go try to be a secretary at the local uh law firm right when she discovered in addition to
getting this old house she now owns the rights to the ghostbusters brand and she uses that to make money that would be
fun so that's that's that's like the core basic idea that probably that i and
probably a million other people have had about ghostbusters three is that after ghostbusters two where do you go you do
the same gag again no you franchise it right yeah you have bill murray ernie hudson uh uh
ray stance dan aykroyd whatever his name is and harold ramus and they're like corporate guys and they they run and you
know harold ramus and um and dan aykroyd are in the basement of this like skyscraper and they're doing like you
know they have no understanding of the corporate world and then it's bill murray on the phone you know hey listen
our cleveland uh chapter of the ghostbusters is having problems with their with their equipment you know
can we get cheaper people to fix it you know he's doing this his bill murray thing right and then then he cuts the budget to save
money and that's when things go bad that then in the third
the other the fictional third ghostbusters movie uh something happens that bankrupts all the
chapters and everybody quits or they maybe they try to unionize you do something really like grossly cynical
and then bill murray fires them all and he fired all the ghostbusters and then and that's when the doom threat
comes in after the ghostbusters try to unionize phil murray doesn't want to pay him oh i fired them all he fired all of them
see these are all things that are in the kind of spirit of the original movie which is why i don't understand people
talking about this movie even like the filmmakers were like this is made for the fans this is for people that want to go like this is so far removed tonally
from anything ghostbusters jason reitman wrote a great script so full of heart and
going right back to the first two movies and its dna and its heart and soul and we just read it and thought you know
this is this is the right time and uh and this is the right way to do it if there's a steady paycheck in it
i'll believe anything you say had you done ghostbusters 3 in 1992
or 1994 or something like that yeah you age them up another flash forward another five years
then you could do ghostbusters three in the same spirit of ghostbusters one it is 38 years later so you have to do the
grandchildren of the ghostbusters yeah and you have to do what which would be who knows i would be
less bothered by this movie if it wasn't just doing the exact same villain plot from the first movie like small town like it
just inter like how hard is it to just create a new villain i know but the second can't have the references to the
terror dogs oh god and goes or can't show up at the end that's that's that's the thing is like
ghostbusters 20 she can't she can't ask ray if he's a god again remember that remember that
are you a god
no the 2016 movie is like character-wise like the main ghostbusters characters
beat for beat the first movie but with a different villain and this movie is kind of its own story but then the third
act is the villain so you've picked everything clean from that first movie there is nothing else
to like like chew off that bone where the heck was slimer well now we got muncher that's that's
how they varied it up that's the only because nothing in this movie is there's not an original bone in this movie
instead of slimer we have muncher but we got stapled marshmallow man we got gozer like even like the second movie like
isn't very good but at least it's got different creatures in it i love the first act of the second movie just
because when you see all the different places they ended up and they're all very characters appropriate yeah
let's see what happens when we take away the puppy well that's the the that's the fun stuff in the second one and what really
pinpoints what works about ghostbusters is those specific characters and now you can't do that anymore so you introduce
stranger things and then and then you just repeat the first movie's formula again uh
yeah and then you have the t's at the well spoilers post credits ernie hudson
taking on the mantle of the you know the grandfather he's going to finance everything he's going to dust off the
the old he still kept the old firehouse even though they said it got turned into a starbucks because that was a joke that
dan aykroyd came up with and they left it in even though it didn't match with the post-credit thing that's weird
that horrible dan aykroyd exposition scene because a complete stranger calls him up
and he just dumps all this has no idea who she is you you know dan aykroyd's lost it when
he can't deliver exposition anymore can i say that was the worst part of the movie
original ghostbusters show up they did not need they did not need to be in this i would have been fine with just that one racing like it needed to be kind of
worked on a little bit so it made sense because he's just dumping all this exposition but if that was it
you're making a movie about the next generation about the kids don't don't have the old ghostbusters
show up at the end just to steal the spotlight and be awkward and confuse kids in the audience
that haven't seen ghostbusters don't do that which is who this movie is aimed at you know my dad says you guys are full
of crap can i tell you my thought process while the movie was happening live uh i was like annie potts in the
beginning oh cute she had a wonderful line that there were two moments in this movie that i thought
were self-referential which is why i like the first 80 60 80 percent of it
um annie potts says uh carrie asks her if the house is worth anything and she goes she goes no
it's worth absolutely nothing unless you're considering the sentimental value
then in the car the they're on their way to school and i think it's finn wolfhard or the mom who says okay
let's get the jokes over with and then she goes and she does the joke uh i forget the joke he does
the adam's jokes yes she does science jokes that's a reoccurring thing throughout the world and so um
that was sort of like where are the jokes where are the jokes it was a ghostbusters move that was aimed at people like us who will say why wasn't
it a comedy i wasn't one of those people i i wanted this movie to be less of a comedy i was i was there was a couple
little like cute moments and asides and little comments that i thought were like humorous but nothing like we're trying
too hard that was the problem with this 2016 one well that's trying way too hard and this was like oh now they're they're
barely trying this isn't this is you know this is an indie drama this edward it's not in any drama it's
stranger things that's what this was until the end when it became a mess just the end of
ghostbusters it was like a a nostalgia
i was drowning i was drowning i couldn't i couldn't breathe
and and it was like no no but but i'm like annie potts right uh that's cute
she just shows up oh he gone his past oh and she's the conservator of his state
or whatever fine uh the race dance cameo yes hello this is ray stance and then at
the end i'm like bill murray hasn't shown up and then i knew it was going to happen but they said wanted to happen
they said he went back to academia right and i'm like okay that was a joke in and of itself sure but i was like okay at the
end you're going to have the little girl she's so smart she she breathes through high school and she's going into college
early and one of her classes he's the professor and he turns around and i'm like oh that's going to be a great cameo for bill murray when it when it happens
and like they're not gonna they're not gonna show
show up are they like in the jumpsuits like in the with the pro how did they get new proton
packs like do they i thought ray said egon cleaned them out of all their tech oh they need to show up at the end for
maximum nostalgia they need to stream their proton streams right in your face
to be fair i don't know if ernie hudson ever takes off his jumpsuit like in real life so
that's fine i i assume that they got the backpacks out of the back of it because they come kind of from the side of the ecto one right off the camera they put
them on yeah they're like the ghostbusters two jumpsuits when they wear like the darker
colors to spray the slime around maybe they kept those sure anyway it's so stupid what if they showed up in the 2016
jumpsuits that would have confused everybody i mean i was i was i guess i was happier that they were playing their actual characters as opposed to like
weird people in the reboot which was distracting they didn't need to show up no at all no and it and then when they
showed up i was like they're not they can't save the day because that would deflate all the hard
work and effort and goodwill that has been fought for the entire time making the
little girl the scientists and them heroes and their they they bust their first ghosts driving around the thing
and that's the one scene that was kind of fun that was one that was a really good scene and um they're working on
figuring out the plot by studying his notes and they go down to the and i'm like they can't just come up and show up
these these 70 year old men and shoot their lasers at the monster and kill it and then they
go thanks for saving us that no they're going to fail and then which there's a joke to be made
there like if they play that up like they finally show up there's a big hero moment yeah and then they just get knocked over like they kind of do that
but it's not really played for laughs it's played more for tension which is weird for some reason they just these
directors just like to say okay now you guys are all down on the ground yeah because the movie
wanted to wallow in nostalgia and and and tears and love and and warm feelings
and it didn't want to make poke fun at itself and that's the very nature of the
ghostbusters idea is that it's like stupid you know it's just occurred to me we really haven't had a completely
successful test of this equipment i blame myself so do i the whole thing is a joke it's it's
self-deprecating dumb and no one knows what they're doing and it and they accidentally save the universe
by forming a stupid business because bill murray is greedy i mean it's a hilarious film it's a it's a beautiful lightning
and a bottle kind of movie and this is just like it's like a disgusting shell of of that idea
marketed for on nostalgia yeah well that's like i said in the opening like it's not made
for ghostbusters fans it's made for people that just love to celebrate the fact that they like ghostbusters it's
like a celebration of the first movie in like a meta way i was only gonna make this movie we could get everybody back
and it was a thrill the day that they showed up on set again uh to see the three guys standing next to each other
for my father for my fee for me for also all these young actors i mean it's like seeing the beatles back together
remember when you're with the beatles and then at the end when spoilers i we
predicted this that cgi harold ramus would show up and he does did he get harold ramus's
permission for his likeness well that's a whole other conversation i think we brought that up in the halloween kills video but i think you might have cut it
out the kind of moral aspect of doing cgi versions of these dead actors
it's it's not moral like well i imagine somebody like taking a cgi version of me
after i'm dead and like putting me in some kind of like commercial for yeah it's something disgusting i mean i know
it's like and then they dedicate the movie at the end for harold and it's like i know ivan reitman was friends with him and
bill murray kind of hated him up till like the very last days of his life but like the whole ending of it felt so like
manipulative and gross how often they kept cutting to that cgi ghost of harold ray they almost got it
right too like you you mentioned this i i agree with you completely if if their movies attribute to harold
ramus harold ramos was was a very smart man and he made some very funny comedies we're not really violent people
this is our first gun no it isn't he wrote animal house which is the ultimate like anti-nostalgia movie takes
place in the 60s and it's about how horrible everything was i'm fine with doing something completely new with this
and different from the original ghostbusters you can have the heart the problem is the execution and like the long shots of
cgi harold rambus way were not the way to do it yeah yeah we were talking about the little phoebe holds up her gun and
you see his spirit helping him like you just see the the arm yeah and that's that was enough you get it you get it i
thought that's what they were gonna do for a second but then they just kept cutting to it and sucked all of the magic that the the spirit of your
grandfather had away just by shoving them in your face yeah
the cgi was good yeah they've they've perfected
stealing dead people's likenesses and using them against their will yeah they've perfected that technology but
richly dedicated the movie to him so that makes it all okay now harold rambus could be a ghostbuster forever uh what a
horrible thought but he had to like say goodbye and hug everyone every character including his
daughter who he didn't like or she didn't like him because he walked out on them
but he had a mission because he couldn't you know he couldn't ever call her or communicate with them
yeah that didn't make any sense well and then like the whole idea that oh he's because at first it's like oh he's is he a deadbeat dad like that's kind of
shitty to do that character turns out no he was doing this all to help everybody and save him but the opening scene of
the movie is him failing to do that and dying that's kind of horrible it's horrible but that's what kicks off the
plot jay i understand that but it's still like when your entire movie is attribute to harold ramus and the
opening scene is him failing in a non-comedic way he succeeds ultimately he's there as a ghost
just roll his eyes at this movie that's what i'm saying like everything he wrote was so you know like caddyshack and animal
house it was so against everything that's happening at the end of this movie as far as the uh the emotional
stuff goes do you think this movie
was made for harold or what or was it made
for truckloads of money a franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our
wildest dreams i i think it was made to write the course because they started a new production company ghost corp with
the 2016 movie equals core ghost core and that movie was such a horrible flop that they immediately were like we got
to fix this it should be called ghost corpse yeah i was surprised to see that logo i
was like i thought that was shuttered i thought that was good no no well they got to justify having that company put
together so it's like yeah that movie we up so bad we have to immediately
in in you're screaming in the face of a hurricane of
capitalizing on nostalgia and marketing mike our generation will not let our
toys go ever proton tap ready and with my new ghost snapper all
systems are go that's it you don't we're going to insist that our grandchildren keep playing with our toys you had to
like this because i can't have their own toys you need to play with star wars and
ghostbusters well that's the thing is is watching this movie right i was i was when they're driving around
the ecto one right and and i'm like god damn that's a cool
idea it's it's it's such cool design and it's so iconic and and watching this and i'm like what
in this is iconic of its own oh nothing what nowadays is
the new iconic movie thing
i don't know it was it was just it was more sad than anything and and you said ghostbusters this movie's made for
ghostbusters fans right it's made for for adults and and little children that the adults try and drag to the movie
because they liked it when they were kids everyone that has seen it says that they cry at the movie so it should be an
extremely successful comedy that's the thing it's like it's like the proton packs all these
lightsabers the delorean i'm thinking of all this like iconic like 80s
tech that was always in service of a story and characters and and and now it's like
the opposite they're the characters are in service of the tech yeah
the first time they turn on the proton pack in this we get like five shots extreme close-ups of it they never
showed a close-up of the proton pack ever going up i'll take the next one
i'll excuse some of that i will excuse some of that with this movie because this is a movie about nostalgia it's just how hard you go into it and
like like you don't need the individual lines like somebody to say uh who are you gonna call it you don't need to go that far but like
the magical shots effective one and the pro i get that well i mean there's i mean i think we talked about that we talked about the
trailer it's like that's not fan service like that's the tech like that's just what these movies are
it's more the the like extreme close-ups of it how magical everything is they even do i couldn't believe they did the
crunch bar you've earned it she's looking through the old jumpsuits
and pulls out the crunch bar which was just a one-off gag at the very beginning of the first movie he left that crunch
bar rapper in there for 38 years because it meant something to him that
was bill murray around on the set bill murray introduced him to crunch bars and he oh he's always loved them
since oh oh okay in fact it could be what killed him
he had way too many his diabetes and blood sugar went out of control so that was just a recent crunch bar
okay so you're wrong the whole building is a huge superconductive antenna that
was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence the the misty-eyed
teary-eyed view of nostalgia doesn't work in the ghostbusters universe because it's a
a flat sarcastic comedy it has there's no magic there's literally no magic
and when they they stumble on the premise that a crazy man in the 1930s or
20s named evo shandor built a a weird building as a lightning rod to open an interdimensional portal
uh they kind of stumble upon that and it just opens up and they don't know what the to do so they just go up
there and confront it because because they have to and what i always say is the fact that all that all the backstory
and mythology is treated so seriously it makes it even funnier when bill murray is just like around right
hey where these stairs go
they go up that's the the contrast that's the joke
yes and you can like i know you're more open to the idea of this movie being a completely different tone i kind of
agree but if you didn't have so many nods to the original and you had a new villain like that would have done a lot to
alleviate how awkward this movie is rely less heavily on the callbacks i actually do think the the rose tinted
glasses nostalgia could have worked a lot better i think the problem with this movie is that like
three quarters of the main cast feel like placeholder characters that don't have very strong arcs yeah well
that's the question there were no ghostbusters in this movie
that's okay we're doing something different i'm fine with that the movie should have been called the the legacy of egon spangler
well you know why they called it were no ghostbusters there literally were no ghostbusters they bust those
ghosts at the end by just shooting at it
that's their clever plan the fact that they don't have a clever plan in the original movie is again a joke go get
her ray
do you remember oh can i make the greatest greatest visual analogy ever oh do you remember when in a
christmas vacation when chevy chase takes the beautiful turkey out of the oven and he cuts into it
that's this movie
right yes it's shiny it's it's juicy looking it has all your all your nostalgia but once you open it it just
deflates like it like and then and shrivels up into nothing because there isn't i guess
it's completely fitting too because that's a national lampoon movie harold ramis were for national lampoon that was
their whole thing right that type of humor i guess the heart of the movie is the little girl
it should have been the whole family not just a little girl sure kind of is but the mother is such a
despicable character and the brother like you said he's bill murray finn wolf nothing he does
he's the placeholder for that character and that he's trying to get the girl and he doesn't really care about what's
happening he doesn't really have much to do no but he's been wolfhard or whatever his character he fixes the car why
why because someone has to does he talk about wanting to be a mechanic does it symbolize something for his character he
just decides to do it because they need a working ecto one they have a shot of him fixing their car changing the oil in it on the highway so
that established that and and the girl is an expert lock pick she comes she comes pre-packaged much
like ray i bypassed the compressor as a 12 year old uh a pre-packaged
character who's instant genius who has no learning to do whatsoever
other than discovery which is not the same as learning right she discovers all the all the gear she already likes
science yeah i mean you know her i guess i was like oh mom she's gonna fix the proton pack
because she takes it apart she's like it's missing a fourth transistor or something i'm like this is dumb to be
fair the ghost of egon is is and i'm like okay so okay so egon helps her
she i don't know i don't know how about how about carrie is a drunk right
and her her daughter the granddaughter of egon spengler is following in her mother's footsteps
and she goes out partying she drinks she has a little interest in science but that genius is buried way deeper down in
there her mother isn't cultivating it and then throughout this whole adventure on the family farm she starts learning
things and discovers her talent to be a smart scientist at the end of the movie
not instant kid genius from the beginning that has absolutely no growth at the end that's the weird thing too is
they establish early on that she's like an outcast she doesn't have friends but then there's never any conflict with
that in the movie like no one ever picks on her she immediately makes a friend with that podcast kid
so she's not really like they never really there's no like human threats or human villains in the movie
no like there's no conflict outside of the the broader plot which is the plot of the first movie yeah there's no uh
uh what's his face pack walter peck yes it's true this man has no dick
not that you need like a one for one of that character but you need like human uh stakes in the movie the sheriff kind
of is a walter pack he's only in like one scene but he doesn't provide any uh
i mean walter peck pulls the plug on the ghost ghost uh prison in the first one shut this off shut these all up the farm is
all we have now but we don't have enough money they're going to foreclose on that too the evil businessman in town
for whatever but then like okay but what do you do rich your idea of the
mom discovering she has the royalty rights to the ghostbusters franchise is
perfect yeah that was my idea it was tasty but i'm you're doing something with her you had
to cut off that's a good idea damn it correction jay what in the hell said that
uh where yeah she can't pay the rent and then they have to move out and they can find this disgusting farmhouse and then
she she's the mom's like sitting there with wine like at night and watching the videos and and she maybe maybe she's
like pushing her kids to like be ghostbusters they like buy the local like general
store that's gone out of business and you know then you can have like it be like this like terribly run family
business where she's like using her kids who are underage to like bust ghosts she gets it
keeps getting in trouble with the cops and and you have it really like funny yeah
maybe they're not even busting ghosts he's just trying to merchandise like the logos and whatnot okay based on
nostalgia based on the story you work that yeah oh you mean the ghostbusters hot
beverage thermal mug and free balloons for the kids
and they mentioned that remember the podcast kid says there are more dead bodies in this town than living
people i thought that was going to pay off later i guess it did there was a miner sitting at the cafe that looked
just like the cab driver for the first movie but how about like all the ghosts from all the dead miners come alive and
then carrie has to has to actually start the business is no longer a front
to sell to sell merchandise to like man children who love the ghostbusters and then she's like oh my gosh you know how
does this equipment work you know and then her daughter has to start learning how to work it because she was her maybe
her daughter's like like a meth addict or a drunk like her mother the 12 year old daughter
we age do that with flint give him something so he has something to do sure i hate instant genius
daughter her character was written fine her performance was fine she had several egonish kind of like
ticks yeah which which was great but i hate instagenious kids i'm rerouting the
electricity in the building to give it more amplitude no no 12 year old in the world knows how to
do anything they know how to yell they know how to they know how to watch
videos on tick tock they don't know how to do that it's it's so terrible and and unrealistic you
know ever ever be 17 finn wolfhard could be 24
and he's like an ex-convict and the daughter is like like like a drug addict and an alcoholic and the mom is even
worse make them the worst people ever like they were making literally making
this movie for babies that's the reason none of this would happen they are they're making it for tiny
children which is why the kids are the age they are egon spangler's family is just
pathetic white trash with with some with some charm you're right they're not like like like awful
people like criminals or whatever they're just like like really sad and and skeezy and scheming that
opening bit where where carrie is cutting uh uh finn wolfhard's hair like over his food
that was weird because it wasn't really played for laughs but it's like this is disgusting no but she's using she was using a box cutter to cut his hair was
she yes no she had an electric razor because he she caught him it looked like a box cutter i thought it was an electric razor i think it was an
electric razor and i'm like why did who does it have scissors the poorest people have scissors you know you mentioned i'm
just going to go back a little bit the army of uh undead minor ghosts that probably would have been a lot more
interesting for the final battle than just doing gozer again small town in
oklahoma gets overrun with the ghosts of miners that were exploited by i want to say evo shandor but we'll
cut that out no you know what do it even chandra it's fine he was a prick supernatural well how about the guy who
started the town the hell of a different sure sure mr mr jones sure i don't know who for the cares but we're not
fighting ghosts or two dogs again jones okay that's a great one obsidian jones the
villainous man who formed the town to mine for ore or gold knew that there were a
hundred met trapped miners down below in the mine and and accidentally hit the dynamite and
trapped them and killed them all and they buried all the miners 100th year anniversary of the mining accident they
all come back to life to find the the the descendants of obsidian jones who are like the town
pricks that live in the largest house in the town control the town right yeah sure and they've been giving carrie
and her her stupid kids trouble starting their business because they're just and at the end they need their
help to save them because all the dead minor ghosts are coming to storm their house like townspeople with pitchforks
a little social commentary yes and so now you need my business's help
light them up kids
hey what's the daughter saying phoeni hey phoebe yeah ma
put down the flask and pick up the proton pack
while we're at it we're cleaning out your walmart
i was hoping something like that would happen
it broke their doors down yeah broke through the door that was kind of it ghostbusters tree that's part of why
the scene where they they first get in the when they're chasing the not slimer ghost around the town
well that seems kind of fun because like we haven't seen anything like that in a ghostbusters movie
like you know one used in an action scene using an action scene and also like they barely know what they're doing
so they're just destroying the town with the proton back that's the one fun scene in the movie is
the equivalent to the the the plaza hotel seat it's similar to the yeah but it's uh i don't know
i guess like the only new idea in the movie is that it has a gunner's seat that's pretty much it but i don't know
why they would build that but okay yeah for all their post ghostbusters two adventures that's the thing is the movie
kind of ignores ghostbusters too except for raze occult books the plot is so tied in with
the the uh threat from the first movie yeah and they say and there hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years so it's like ghosts
really don't exist outside of ivo shandor and gozer
it kind of limits what you can do with future sequels that's why it should just be a separate villain a new villain
yeah as opposed to making it so tied in with the first one and saying that ghosts have never existed anywhere
outside of that uh event in new york city from 30 years ago they said like yeah the the
um the ghost sightings were going down and that's the thing with the first one is that they were
it was serendipitous that they started their business at the time they did because the the only ghost they saw was
the librarian ghost and that was just like a straight-up ghost ghost when when all the the the prophecy was
coming true that's when all the paranormal activities started happening had the ghostbusters not started their business
because of crackpot egon and rey's interest in the paranormal and peter venkman's greed 24 hours a day
seven days a week no job is too big no fee is too big yes yeah peter venkman just wanting to
to grift um the whole world would be enslaved by by gozer the gosarian right that it was
that's the funny part that's what's funny an interdimensional god is coming to earth
on a predetermined date and the ghostbusters just happen to form right before it happens we've been going
about this all wrong this mr stay puft is okay he's a sailor he's in new york we get this guy laid we won't have any
trouble this is one of those movies and i think that's just i i don't know i think i've shifted from being like angry
like disappointed fanboy kind of like person even though yeah i'm well past that i've never been like a fanboy of
like i like stuff and you always get frustrated when they screw it up you know like making a new tv show about
captain picard and it's just so it's so wrong
and what are all the external forces that make it like the the paul rudd and the cutesy
marshmallow men why do they look like that why are they gonna have a scene in walmart we need cutesy little characters
yeah remember the stay puft marshmallow remember marshmallow man their logic in the movies
this is how they'll defend it in the movie when the gozer showed up to get sigourney weaver
it's it's eerily ghostly magical presence caused weird things to happen in our apartment it caused the eggs to
burst out of their shells so the fact that gozer was in a walmart it caused the staypuf marshmallowman product on
the shelf specifically yeah that product for no reason at all to come alive i mean that's fine that supernatural
things were happening in the wall ice cream could have come alive and it'd be like the stuff the movie the stuff
now all the although out of all the
products at walmart those are the ones that came alive for no reason at all well anything that company would be done
after the events of the first movie you changed your mascot you get rid of the staple marshmallow bad your mascot
stepped on 500 people do you remember there used to be a pain reliever called aids i've tried fad
diets powders pills still my weight's been up and down like a yo-yo until the aids plan taught me how to take off
weight and help keep it off yes yes yes they changed that name
yeah you have pain muscle pain use aids
aids may taste like a candy but aids contains one of the most effective appetite suppressants you can buy
i have one other issue i want to bring up because i feel bad if i don't ever bring this up uh you're the ghostbusters
and the the smart one of the group says there's a world ending threat coming why don't you believe him yeah that was
weird too you've been busting ghosts for years and you already fought a god once dan
aykroyd yeah at the end of the movie he apologizes to him for not believing him yeah dan awkward of all people ray
stants of all people would believe him yeah and you'd think at some point egon would call up right and say ray
come out here and take a look at these ancient ruins that i found
he knows it's coming he's prepared i've been working on uh burying 700
ghost traps in my my crops yeah also come take a look at this monument
to gozer that i found under the ground that's literally
you could see it with your eyes it's not that i'm a crackpot there's literal proof look at the spirits coming
up from the well you can see the yeah look at the proof he could send them a picture they don't
even have to show up they can just take pictures of the gozer monuments and send that to them well and the the the
spirits coming out of the pit because it happens that's the explanation for the earthquakes in this
town is that's the uh spangler's tick-tock just he's just constantly filming
i'm warning the world it would have been better if egon was like like just writing on the walls kind of crazy and
literally had nothing you know and and in that that might have been worse as far as the
the fate of that character but no no whatever you're just talking about in terms of the story in terms of an actual
plot that makes sense and then and in the barn is to go he took the ghostbusters car and there are four proton packs a handful of traps that's
all they had there's more proton packs everywhere in this movie for no reason
he has a hanging up he's got 700 ghost traps i guess he built them all although he
couldn't keep the power on so ray i guess had 700 ghost traps they
had like two right he probably built more that's what he was doing on the farm
building more i could see them realistically having like a dozen ghost traps and the reason for all the
ghost traps is you can't you can catch gozer with a bunch of traps as opposed to just capturing them in one
trap he's a god jake yeah you need a whole bunch of power from all these different you can't develop a new device
well that's yeah why does it have to be trabs because that because you know absolutely yeah yeah
we just keep going in circles with these discussions of why did they do this oh we know why they did he should have built a new device
that was like a gozer catching trap that was just like as big as you know a barn
and they had to dust it off but i kind of thought they were going to do that when they said like the house is a trap i thought it was going to be like yeah
something bigger than the structure of the house or something yeah something
something a little more grand than burying a hundred ghost traps in the dirt so weird it's just so weird
i would have been just happy if the car was just sitting in there just rotting with the proton packs in the back and
that's all yugon had hegan has gone off he got has gone bye-bye
and and he's just he's like he's too smart for his own good and you know just he's he's living like a hoarder and he's
crazy and then he gets justified at the end because our you have to have our characters like accomplish something
remember our characters they accomplish something egon is a crackpot no one believes them
he's got four dusty proton packs that he stole two traps in in the in the ghostbusters
car in the in in the barn covered in dust and he's got a book in the basement
maybe he was watching football games don't they and he'll and he's got a book that says ghosts on it and and he wrote all over
the wall a bunch of numbers and that's it and and he just sat there like rocking back and forth eating chicken
noodle soup in a bathrobe and then he died and your characters have to figure out what he
was doing as opposed to just reading what exactly what he was doing i think we're focusing on the first 75 of
this movie because that's where and we're forgetting i think our brains are making us forget
everything past the walmart and it turned into a literal nightmare
we're sitting there we're constructing the film from the beginning going how do we do this how do you make this work
better yeah and and for a while it was working okay until they just dumped all
of the characters they had built up threw them out the window and turned it into like a walmart commercial and and
started dumping like melted uh marshmallow on your face and smashing like you said you said to
me in the theater you're like uh because trapped in a in a monster and so is paul
rudd just like the end of the first movie and they go up and they they break open the head finn wolfhard immediately goes up
to it and rips the head off the because he knows they're in there because in the first one they discover it and
here he just knows to break the head off this thing because the person is trapped inside the first one did he know that he
didn't the movie knew that he watched the first movie on vhs yeah paul rudd showed it to him in his class where he
showed cujo and child's play yeah he showed up the first ghostbusters movie
right well the only thing lurking inside here is my slowly dying soul what would you say is worse
this one or the 2016 2016. well yeah they're both kind of pathetic and wrong
in different ways but this one at least like you look you watch it and it kind of looks like a movie
like the 2016 one is just so bad and so awkwardly assembled like trying to
cobble together all this improv like this at least feels like a movie and the scene where they're driving through the
town shooting the proton pack is kind of fun this movie has parts i like i look at this movie and i see things that could
have worked but just didn't yeah i i would say i 60 to 70 percent like this
movie i know it sounds like we've all been right yeah i mean it's not it's not terrible until it is well i mean the ending's
terrible but even up until then like i said i there was really nothing to latch on to as far as the characters go it was
it was hard to get into it i i was getting very bored because nothing was happening there was
there it was it was it was scene after scene of we're discovering something from the first movie the spielberg like people looking
and just like just very slow shots of them like panning around and looking and
everyone was looking and it was really dull the paul rudd classroom scenes were fine it just i don't know it just felt
so like empty um for for so long where there wasn't like
like a build up yeah and there it didn't feel like we were building to anything and that the result of that is is
boredom now i don't feel like we're building towards anything like you're supposed to be getting teary-eyed when we see the ecto-1 again
no that's the idea that's what it was teary-eyed you're supposed to get yeah
that's i bet if you look up like reactions to this movie people are saying i got so emotional at the end
i i cried when i saw the pke meter i can guarantee yeah that's the reaction i
don't understand how people can think like that go see ghostbusters this weekend kids
but bring lots of tissues with you the last 30 minutes of afterlife is what mainstream movie making is all about who
you gonna call hashtag ghostbusters afterlife is legitimately one of the
best sequels in recent years in the most emotional ghostbusters film to date i ugly cried watching the end of
ghostbusters afterlife ghostbusters afterlife is absolutely
spectacular in every way there were tears harold ramis heart the sound of ecto-1 sent shivers
down my spine ghostbusters afterlife is going to be the only thing on my mind for the entirety of this weekend
just watched it and yes i completely cried for like the last half hour
barely calming down during the credits then i teared up at the post credit scene i just cried through most of
hashtag ghostbusters afterlife hit me right in the feels
ghostbusters afterlife was the best tribute they could have given harold remus and his character of egon
there's no emotional resonance from the first ghostbusters movie whatsoever no because that's not what that movie was
it's almost like like you're taken out of the movie like you're
like i could see getting emotional like if there was like a ghostbusters reunion you know all the actors they're talking
about how much fun they had making the movie that's what this feels like feels like you're outside of the movie like
looking in you're sure you're looking at this wrong this isn't nostalgia for the first ghostbusters movie this is
nostalgia for ghostbusters merchandise thank you stan and spangler are here so are these
the eyeball ghost the eyeball goes that makes the cameo yeah it's a strange thing
very bizarre this movie on many levels like psychological levels
because it's barely a movie yeah we're talking about a broken eggshell
on the ground trying to turn it into an egg
that's a clip from ghostbusters one i guess i'm not sure but that's what we're talking about we're talk there's a broken egg on the
ground we're just talking at it trying to trying to make it into an egg again
it's something that will never happen wait i don't know they won't let it die yeah it's a franchise i guess
well they're trying to make it into a franchise we'll see how successful this one is yeah they failed with the last one
there'll be another failure in five years that's the thing like especially after and i think like for me
i'm so sick of ghostbusters not even like the 2016 movie sucked but whatever to me it was more like the discourse
around it like what a nightmare that was that killed any interest i would ever have yeah in anything
ghostbusters related and that feels like i'm not nostalgic for it but that feels like a million years ago too that type
of discussion like eternals that's not really sticking people trying to use that type of stuff
like like that's that's the thing of the past now internals is that the new movie with
betty white don't say that william been saying betty white jokes for years
though she is immortal i know her and mel brooks
uh oh and henry kissinger the eternals
old whites never die
