PLINKETT:
Half in the Bag.
The final downfall of Mike and Jay.

MIKE:
Oh, god.
I just shit my pants.

JAY:
Oh, again?

MIKE:
Will you change my diaper, daddy?

JAY:
I haven't changed mine yet.

MIKE:
Ugh.
Oh, yes.

JAYT:
No, Mike.
No.
No more Glembeeza.

MIKE:
I gotta take my pain away.
There's a new Avatar movie coming out soon, and I want to be dead before then.
Glembeeza, take me away!

JAY:
No, Mike.
No.
No.
No more Glembeeza!

MIKE:
You fucker!
Give me my pills!

JAY:
What?

MIKE:
Uh?

PLINKETT:
Hello, Mike and Jay.
It's me, Harry Plinkett, from Lightning Fast VCR Repair.

JAY:
What?
Who?

PLINKETT:
I'm here to fix your VCR, and I only charge about five thousand dollars a minute.
And it should only take me about ten years.

MIKE:
Hey, Jay.
Did you call some guy to come fix our VCR?

PLINKETT:
Oh.
Oh.
Let me help you with that!

MIKE:
Oh.
Thank you, sir.
What?
Ugh!

JAY:
Hey, mister.
Let me teach you a thing or two about politeness.
That's not very professional.

PLINKETT:
I'll tell you what's not professional.
Defrauding an old man for over ten years.
Why, all he wanted was to watch his Night Court tape.
And you made him wait so long, they rebooted this series.
I checked my bank account, and you two frogs have stolen over three million dollars of my money.

JAY:
Oh, wow.

PLINKETT:
What did you spend it all on?
Booze?
Movie tickets?
I'll tell you what you didn't spend it on: Jenny Craig.

PLINKETT:
Hey, that's uncalled for.
I have a thyroid problem.

JAY:
It's very rude.
Very rude.
[Applause]
[Music]
uh look we just got to order a couple
just a couple more questions
Grandma now get in your wheelchair and
shut up oh God I'm stuck oh no
look look we'll pay you back all the
money okay I'll go to the thrift store
and buy a VCR for like a dollar then you
can watch your Nightcore tape okay oh
I've already watched my night court tape
sucked wasn't funny anymore what in fact
I found most of the humor pretty cringe
sexist problematic
it's no longer on fleek oh my God Mr
plink it's gone woke how dare you talk
about Night Court like that
oh I'm working on business in my pocket
ah Glen Visa the final downfall of Mike
and Jay
who would have thought that a
pharmaceutical company could produce a
product that would ruin somebody's life
the sweet release of
it came with such a steep price didn't
it you speak of my pain
it runs deep
let me share it with you what the [ __ ]
oh my God
oh
God oh no what the [ __ ]
take that you [ __ ] mother yeah
oh my God my hands are falling down
oh
[Music]
please Mister stop don't hurt him
oh God I just can't help you now Mike oh
oh oh oh oh
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
good how how are you so young and virile
you were once a daughtering old man
confused and frail is it the Adderall
did you snort it like all the college
kids do nowadays no Jay
it turns out the answer to Eternal youth
was right in front of us all along in
fact
it's all around us
filth
in a manner of speaking yes you see one
day when I was fixing VCRs for you two I
broke one of my tools
and while attempting to remove a part
from the inside of the VCR with my teeth
my tongue came in contact with the VCR
Head drum the rest of the day I had a
strange energy that I just couldn't
explain I used a solution to remove the
outermost layer of chemicals from the
Head drum after confirming with an Old
Navy chemist buddy of mine from World
War II I determined that the compound
used to protect the Head drum from
magnetic damage was called sidroxy
drazanine 63 an element that is not from
planet Earth after doing some research I
discovered that the man that invented
the first videotape media process in
1956 was oddly enough a young private
that was at the site of the Roswell
crash in New Mexico I read about that in
a magazine this chemical compound when
ingested reverses cellular degradation
and re-extends the length on your
genetic telomeres
span of a few months ID age from a 100
something year old man
it's my current age of
58. don't I look right
so you found the Fountain of Youth in
our VCR repair shop and it involves
licking a part of a VCR
video Head drum yes I lick so many heads
it made me young again
um I just love giving head I mean
licking heads
we see our heads that don't make no
sense
who writes this crap uh what the thing
is no one in human history has ever
looked at VCR head before because why
would they oh it was mere accident that
I discovered this VCR part is made with
a DNA altering alien technology
in a few months I'll be 20 years old
again and I'm gonna Market this element
in pill form and make zillions of
dollars
that's not a bad idea actually
good on you little boy
but what about the VCR repair shop out
of business I dismantled and looked the
drums of every VCR that every idiot
brought in
soon the company went out of business
your location is now a payday loan store
oh
well what about the other branches oh
the whole company's been dissolved uh
your former boss the CEO Tim yeah he
sold his share of the company and is now
working for Trump's 2024 presidential
campaign
huh well that's surprising
zombies
here
kill yourself with Ibiza see if I care
soon with President Trump by my side we
will rule this universe for eternity
[Music]
hahaha
[Laughter]
[Music]
uh Mike why are we here again because
Jay this happened the bag timeline is
totally [ __ ] these guys have written
themselves into a boring dumb hole where
they have to play characters that nobody
wants to see there's other half of the
bag timelines thousands maybe even
Millions but in only six of them Mike
isn't fat hey that's uncalled for I have
a thyroid problem isn't this a lot like
that Star Trek TNG episode parallels
that you hate so much
oh it is and good job being one step
ahead of the annoying comments but some
timelines are just too lame to exist
okay so what do we do use the Deus Ex
machine just type in uh in this universe
the guy who invented glenbisa got hit by
a bus and died and then hit enter
hey it worked okay great now let's go
fix the universe where Jay never grew
his beard oh
thank you
oh man I can't wait for tonight's game
the Packers are having their best season
ever I love football that's right Jay
but I think you're wrong about something
you said I do not think Brett Favre
should retire even at 53 he's still
getting it done thank God after all
these years he's still the Packers
quarterback if not who knows what he'd
be doing maybe something horribly shady
and illegal
you guys fix my VCR yet
um not quite yet Mr plinkett uh no it'll
be done soon we're just waiting on those
parts oh good good it's been a while now
and I really want to watch my new heart
tape should we tell him that Bob Newhart
died 12 years ago no let's not spoil the
surprise
oh I'm getting a notification on my
cellular telephone hmm
oh the movie theater down the street is
re-releasing Star Wars episode 1 rise of
the dark side oh that's awesome you know
how much I love the Star Wars prequels
Jay George Lucas man he's pure Kino I
can't wait to see what he does with the
upcoming episode 789 to me it's amazing
that a huge franchise like Star Wars is
still under the control of a singular
artist and has it been sold off to some
soulless Mega Corporation well let's
head on down to the movie theater maybe
when we're there we can see another
movie too absolutely I love the theater
going experience let's go
[Music]
