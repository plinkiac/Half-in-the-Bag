["Half in the bag."]
Jay: Oh, what are you doing?
Mike: I was going to read the intro to Malignant that I wrote.
i guess
this is a half in the bag first usually
one of us writes the intro and reads it
or
writes it and makes the other one read
it but what a pickle rick
uh well jay i guess we're both gonna
read our intros
dueling intros dueling intros and
everybody don't forget to like and
comment on whose intro was better leave
your comments below and hit that like
button and
jay you start okay
i'm having visions
from visionary director james juan who
never met a wide angle lens he didn't
love comes belignan the worst studio
movie of the year
or maybe the best
most divisive
the movie is a loving homage to crappy
bee movies of the past
or maybe that was an accident
i don't know
what is this
what is it
that's my intro
it's a pretty good intro thank you
here's my intro okay
i'm having visions
from the director of district 9 and
elysium
i mean from the director of the sixth
sense and unbreakable
i mean from the director of the
conjuring and insidious it's malignant
that's right everyone james juan is back
and so is our lead character
get it
the usually competent director has
created a film that would make tommy why
so blush direct to hbo max from james
wan's newly created film company it
sounded good on paper films comes a
movie with the story so stupid weird and
confusing david lynch understood it
if laughter were a cure to cancer this
film could cure itself
that was pretty good too
dueling intros everybody yeah a movie so
nice we introduced twice it's malignant
the film that's taking the internet by
storm
what's that i don't know
i heard a thunder clap no it's not
supposed to rain today
anyway jay what did you think of
malignant well i think based on our
intros we're kind of looking at the
movie from different perspectives but
coming to the same conclusion which is
that it's very funny
the question is how much of that is
intentional there are many questions
one could say we're looking at it from
two different perspectives
two faces oh no
oh do we do we want to just say spoilers
right off the bat we're gonna spoil this
whole thing because
that's the interesting stuff to talk
about yeah well if you i mean uh first
of all let's do this backwards
backwards
um you're full of them today oh my god i
got so many i got so many
uh first of all if you have hbo max
already the movie's free it's not like
disney where you have to pay 30 for it
early access or you have to rent it or
buy it uh it comes included with hbo max
so
go ahead watch it because i fully
recommend it it's hilarious uh and uh
it's something to behold it's the new
the room and you don't say that too
often it's okay it's it's
the new
wish-upon
i was gonna say it's the new freddy got
fingered in the sense that this is
someone who's in a unique position where
they have a lot of clout
in the case of freddy got fingered tom
green was super popular from mtv he was
in the movie road trip and the studio is
like make what you want we don't
understand it but you're popular so make
what you want in the case of this movie
james juan made aquaman which made a
billion dollars he has a good
relationship with warner brothers and
they said you made us a billion dollars
make what you want and so he used it as
an excuse to make something that no
studio in their right mind would ever
green light otherwise
in theory you are assuming right uh i
guess i'm assuming because it's to me
all the the humor and the weirdness of
this movie comes across completely
intentional i did a little bit of
digging not i didn't read anything like
backstory behind the scenes me either
right i'd be curious to watch like
interviews with james juan
you know you just gotta be bold you
gotta take chances because if you don't
you end up making the same old thing
again and again how much do you know
about the backstory of this do you know
anything i i know nothing about it i
know very little about james wan
actually he's very successful so i'm
surprised that like he's responsible for
the the saw franchise and the conjuring
universe like all these big things right
um and all of his movies up until now
have been
crowd pleasingly competent
they're never great like the conjuring
movies i like well enough the first two
he didn't direct the third one and that
one sucked i like the insidious movies
more and those seem to be less popular
and so this feels more like going in
that direction
of
kind of more like crazy fantastical
weirder
um but as far as like influences i i
think i saw blurb that he was
at least partially influenced by italian
jollo films which shows there's the
black glove killer there's the elaborate
creative set pieces
um but that's more of just a
superficial homage because it's not it
doesn't feel like a jolloid movie it
feels like a troma movie or something or
it's a little mixture of a bunch of
different genres uh yeah i don't know if
he's ever heard the name frank
hennenlotter but this feels like a an
unofficial remake of his movie basket
case
i'm assuming you've never seen basket
case but that's
conjoined twins one of them is a little
mutant on his side that the doctors
separate them when they're little and so
now years later they go to new york to
find the doctors and kill them for
revenge they have like a psychic
connection that's straight up plagiarism
it's it's different enough in this and
tonally it's very different i thought
this was quatto's backstory
literally backstory a literal backstory
before he went to mars and became a
freedom fighter i am half right right
right so it's yeah i don't know tonally
it's like
sam raimi meets dario argento meets
frank henon lotter meets
with with the slickness of a james wand
studio movie which makes the whole thing
even weirder but i looked james one up
on imdb
i needed to see past writing credits
and he's a story by guy okay right
uh a story by story by story by which
you know you have like some bigger
movies that are well written and
constructed like the conjuring movies
and where they have they're very like
boilerplate
you know they don't go bat [ __ ] insane
and
and [ __ ] the audience in their eye
they don't skull [ __ ] the audience right
they they're like we got to do this we
have to have this we have to have these
these these wonderful little character
arcs we have to conclude this we have to
have these sequences that we could put
in the trailer and it's all very very it
has to make sense it has to make sense
um
and so and then james juan is always
story by a story by and then like a real
screenwriter come in
and well saw was him and lee wennell
lee winnell went off to do like he did
the invisible man movie he did that
movie upgrade which i was kind of
thinking of during some of the end of
this movie with the way the fighting was
and the bending backwards and [ __ ] yeah
it reminded me of that so um so this
this has three credited
writers
uh james wan
uh and ingrid bisou
do you know who that is no that is his
new wife okay
um she is in the film
she is a romanian
model actress
uh who's been in a couple of random
things okay and hasn't written really
anything who does she play in the movie
she's the
the uh crime scene girl with the big
glasses
who's who's okay who's smitten on the
asian detective that makes sense because
i saw her in the movie and i was like
this something's off about this
is weird she seems weird she doesn't
seem like an actress why is she in the
movie oh it all makes sense now how bad
is it i've never seen anything quite
like it
maybe from a vehicular accident but not
this her and james juan are the story
buys okay
uh and then there's a an official
written by
uh by a lady named akela cooper akilah
akela cooper
uh an older lady who has uh
a bunch of tv credits
random tv credits okay
some marvel stuff uh some star trek
stuff in production like
just random [ __ ]
no like huge like
uh horror franchise features just just
like
a
a hired screenwriter it looks like two
to help structure it maybe put all their
ideas in place interesting and so you
have
uh
james wan and i i think he married
ingrid in 2020 recently okay and i don't
know how long they were dating for but
you'll find that missing half yeah the
wheel
so i don't know whose idea this was
specifically whether it was james wands
or his wife's or if they came up with it
together or
you know if this was just a big prank
or if they wanted to do a throwback
movie
i think james wan is not the right
director for a throwback movie he's too
slick he's too modern
you need a sam raimi type or yeah
james gunn maybe i don't know
whoever whoever does like
more goofy kind of visuals now james won
his those shots of the spooky house at
night and some of the he's too slick see
it's weird it almost doesn't gel what i
think was probably unintentional is like
you mentioned the the exterior shots of
the house which i don't think that was
intentionally funny but every time they
cut to it it made me laugh because it's
just like a ridiculous amount of smoke
it's all backlit it almost feels like a
parody of a james wand movie i know and
the house itself looks like
the house that every one of his movies
is set in
it's a dingy horror house i'm going to
complain about the house just for one
minute
there's so many things to discuss in
this um and
a
parody comes to mind because they
like
i don't know i'm i'm i'm a grown-up
right
i'm not i'm not in junior high school i
understand like
square footage
on on homes and
and and my eyes can see
yeah and i think about stuff
and and this is a movie versus reality
thing right a lot of people wouldn't
even consider this but you cut to that
exterior of of the spooky house and it's
a very small little it's very narrow
two-story like kind of a victorian house
and
you could see the porch and you could
see the front door and you know
you're gonna walk up that porch and open
that front door
and walk in and there's going to be a
tiny little foyer that's maybe
five feet by eight feet sure a very
small little living room and dining room
and maybe a tiny kitchen before you go
upstairs
to
three
four foot by eight foot bedrooms right
and one bathroom sure
1500 square feet with the in the top
floor too all the rooms have the the
slanted ceilings because you got the
roof right there
but when the character goes up to the
house and walks inside
there's a 30 by 60 foot living room
and her master bedroom is is is 40 by 80
feet yeah
just off the vestibule is the living
room the first thing you notice is the
smaller scale of the room victorians
typically have a number of
interconnecting smaller rooms
and and that's movie that's it has to be
like that for the movie because you
can't have like just a tiny cramped
space clearly it's a soundstage set
especially with some of the the
sequences in this movie too like there's
that overhead shot where it's going from
room to room and it's very like
elaborate and well constructed it's
forgivable in movie logic where you you
need a lot of room you need a nicely
decorated set that's stingy and dark and
there's little specks of light here and
there and smooth smokey and spooky and
big because things happen in the movie
and that's primarily where the whole
movie takes place yeah
in the house you can't ever look and and
the audience is usually forgiving but to
me
it crossed over the line well it's they
they cut to so many exteriors of the
house that's where you wonder if it's
intentional because they cut to it so
many times almost like to remind you of
what it looks like from the outside uh
and so it's not a complaint because i
understand that movies need to be on
sets they can't film in a real house
and movies need to be on big sets but to
me it crossed over the line from movie
logic into parody okay if if i were to
make a horror film parody i would film a
tiny house
and then have gigantic living room sets
where there's just this
tons of of unused space rarely unused
space in houses unless you're a
millionaire a hollywood celebrity right
right
rarely there's a huge
15 to 20 foot
gaps of nothingness on your wall
so i don't know well related to that
then is the structure of the movie
the the whole movie feels like a setup
for the third act and the third act is
the punch line that's when things get
ridiculous
and i almost wish it didn't have that
opening scene we have that little like
teaser scene before the opening credits
which is very like
telegraphing that this is schlock it's
very like sam raimi there's lots of
crazy camera angles and
overacting delivered completely
seriously i tried just to do it with ect
but electroshock had no effect on it
then all the machines started going
crazy it was like he was drinking the
electricity and controlling our machines
if that wasn't there and it just started
looking like a typical james wand movie
which it kind of does for a large poor
portion of it you don't know if it's
supernatural or possession or whatever
because we've seen that all in james
juan movies
like if it really took its time and
built that up and didn't have that
opening to let you know that the movie's
gonna get ridiculous i think it would
have been even better yeah um but as it
is it's like two hours
it takes a little too long to get to
that third act
so yeah tighten all that up because it's
all about
the once we get to that jail cell scene
that's when the movie really kicks into
high gear with all the weird ass [ __ ]
extras 70s 1970s hooker disco woman with
a giant afro
what do hookers look like these days
zoe bell from the queen tarantino movies
with like a mullet she looks like she's
from an 80s movie
it's like yeah that's where the movie
goes off the rails in the best way yeah
and that jail cell set it's gigantic
it's ju it's gigantic and it looks like
like a like a high school play
it's hilarious oh it's great well same
with the uh the uh police station yeah
early on we see an establishing shot of
the police station it's kind of from
like high up looks like a 90s dance club
it's gigantic it looks like yeah it
looks like a disco
uh and at first i was like oh it's just
a stylistic thing these you know this is
very italian feel and there's lots of
unrealistic [ __ ] in italian movies but
no
it's like that so they can have a giant
matrix fight scene at the end where our
demon is cutting off arms and throwing
them at other cops
uh
okay
so structure that's number two i guess
yeah i mean the movie kicks off with
one the flashback in the hospital
uh
where you know there's clearly some kind
of monster
monster baby the extro right it's
because he's in a hospital and they want
to kill it or cut we don't know there's
a bit of a mystery because we don't know
but we know it's schlock yes yeah we
know tonally that it's gonna get goofy
then we cut into james one horror movie
well first we have the opening credits
after the opening stinger at the opening
credits the music is very big and
bombastic
and kind of like
lame rock sounding and it felt like a
very early 2000s movie all of a sudden
i don't remember the opening credit
music i do remember
a very specific song redone
oh yes it's reused throughout the score
they work in the pixies where's my mind
yeah they work it into the score
repeatedly
which thematically i guess makes sense
but it's silly and it's one of those
things or i'm picturing james juan in
the editing room doing that and just
laughing while he counts his warner
brothers checks
i don't know
it made more sense for for uh the fight
club but uh this
it just it has that feel of the that
trendy uh uh reworking of a pop song
um but yeah it's almost wink wink like
uh this is so dumb yeah we're really
doing this yes yes um and that that's
the big
there's just such a big question mark
and it could probably be answered by a
little little google digging and james
wan interview reading but i'd almost
rather not i'd almost rather not know um
when something falls this flat on its
face
i want to want to uh laugh a little and
enjoy it or succeeds completely or
depending on the motivation the greatest
prank in film history um that's why i
compared it to freddy got fingered i
think there might be might be something
to that i can walk backwards faster you
can i can walk backwards fast as you can
stand the backwards man
i can walk backwards you can't i can
walk backwards fast
so let's let's go we we have our our
schlock horror intro
credits then we cut to
our character building slash beginning
of movie which is
our our lead character she's coming home
from work i think she's a nurse or
a dental hygienist oh yeah she's wearing
something she's wearing scrubs then
she's never mentioned she never
mentioned again um what her job is but
she's pregnant
here's where it turns into a lifetime
movie for a little bit the whole thing
is a lifetime move if a lifetime movie
were ultra violent
uh
oh my god yeah lifetime movie the
husband that goes through the abusive
husband which again feels like a parody
hey i was watching that maybe you need
to stop getting pregnant how many times
i have to watch my children die inside
of you tell me what i'm doing are you
saying this is my fault
[ __ ]
it's it's so
so silly
she she comes home and he's not in the
living room watching the game he's for
some reason in the bedroom
i don't know why
there's a tv in the bedroom and he's
lying on the bed
in his like work clothes or just regular
clothes and he's like he's like playing
on his phone too
and he's like why the [ __ ] are you home
from work early i'm watching the game
why are you pregnant stupid i mean he's
saying like the worst things you could
possibly imagine and he's just a monster
yeah
and uh
and then a shocking moment occurs when
he shoves her into the wall yeah and he
hits her head pretty violently on the
level little do we know that that's the
catalyst for the whole film that uh
cracks her skull open
she was born with a parasitic twin
when derek smashed madison's head
against the wall it woke gabriel up
and uh even though she's apparently in
the medical field she doesn't feel that
blood coming out of the back of her head
is worthy of
medical attention just sleep on it yeah
maybe she's used to it from this guy she
knows how to handle herself at this
point when you wake up with blood all
over the back of your pillow uh yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah we'll probably go to the hospital
check that out
but the brain is important
the brain is important the brain is
important
not from the screenwriters
but the brain is important and bleeding
out of the back of your head is is
generally bad
but had she gone to the hospital in the
movie plot logic they would have
discovered that
quanto lives back there quatto
lives in her brain
so let's just spill the beans here and
tell everybody what the plot is
young girl in 1980 something
uh got knocked up 15 year old girl and
then had a baby that had a
conjoined twin uh this happens but not
in
this kind of shockingly graphic schlocky
way where there's a
quatto living on your back
uh so she gives her to this like this
doctor lady
who does surgeries for children
so you kind of get the vibe that she's
doing like creepy experiments or
something in the beginning but it turns
out to not be the case she's just a
doctor who does
surgeries deformity surgeries on
children in a spooky haunted castle in
seattle on a cliff on a cliff right on
the edge of a cliff yeah that
that's a gigantic it's the first shot of
the movie that's again you see that shot
and i laughed yeah it's dracula's castle
yeah it's that's where this happens not
in a modern day medical facility because
i mean this was 1993. that's true
and when uh madison's sister goes and
explores the hospital to look for the
records in the middle of the night yeah
she's bumping into uh wheelchairs from
the 1890s
that i guess they were still in use i
couldn't believe there wasn't more to
that if you have a scene where a
character goes to a spooky abandoned
hospital to to investigate seems like
there should be like a set piece or
something there but she goes and there's
a couple shots of her in the hallways
and then she finds a vhs tape and leaves
immediately well there's there's a
there's a little uh spooky uh scrape
sound or something falls over and she's
like it looks scary you think
something's gonna get there and also
there's a there's a false setup too
where she
the only spot to park her car apparently
is
six inches away from the edge of a cliff
and i'm watching it and i'm like okay
she's running out of the hospital in
fear after bagool
is chasing her yeah and she gets in her
car and accidentally puts it in drive
right oh and she's going off that cliff
that's happening
maybe
maybe that was cut
because why have all that it goes like
there's a lot of setting up her driving
there and parking and going in other
than i guess to
try and build a creepy tent seat yeah
maybe it looked nice on the mat painting
or whatever it's like oh that looks
spooky and edgy edge of your seat i'm
scared
yeah she just finds the tape and then we
cut to the next scene and that's it
maybe like she wasn't around after that
and like the whole ending in the
hospital and the hospital bed falls on
her and that's all like a reshoot
so many questions jay this is truly a
mystery
uh yeah so uh
madison aka emily original name is
abandoned by her birth mother at a
hospital where a doctor performs
life-saving
surgeries on children to correct their
deformities and this is one of the
weirdest cases she ever has
because her conjoined twin
is a malignancy
i guess it's cancerous
even though it's not
we cut out the cancer
but the the weird thing is they share
the same brain
so they cut out as much of
the the creepy puppet monster as they
can and then they just kind of shove the
rest into her skull
where
it can control her brain yeah
can control her brain and as we learn
because she's had many miscarriages over
the years
the reason for that i don't know if they
establish until the sister just explains
it i don't know if she learned it at
some point did i forget where she
learned this she just says hey by the
way all those
miscarriages were the results of your
twin brother gabriel is his name uh of
feeding off
your the babies in your body to grow
strength hey why not how did she know
that it's a logical conclusion
i don't know i really don't did i miss
something did they explain that and i
just forgot maybe the sister just shouts
it out at one point yeah i don't know
madison he killed your babies it was the
cause of your miscarriages he was
leading off of your fetuses to build
himself back up
or the sister learned it from working on
a procedural tv show as a as a pathetic
actress
right that's her character remember
remember
um oh yeah i actually did forget about
that because it's kind of abandoned at a
certain point yeah she goes to the
hospital and she's wearing like a
princess outfit and and then it just
kind of drops
from the movie she has also it's also
teased that she's gonna have some kind
of love love affair with
with the the the hunky asian cop oh yeah
there's a little bit of flirting between
and they flirt and then
he just gets killed at the end yeah and
nothing ever happens i don't know why
that was in there
but yeah there's a there's a bit of a
this is the tiniest little arc we'll
call it a bump
where the
the actress says i learned on one of my
procedural shows that i acted on that
cops do use psychics to help find
missing children oh yeah and then they
say we're going to bring in a a [ __ ]
therapist or somebody to to to go into
your dreams and she's like see i told
you
and then that was it that's another
character yeah she have drove off a
cliff
um
so madison or or she like the the
hospital when she goes to look up the
files at the end instead of being it
closed down and abandoned it's still a
working hospital and she has to act like
she's a cop or something by putting on
her sister's scrubs yeah yeah not a cop
she works yeah she's a nurse and so she
has to to give the best performance of
her life to convince them to let her in
so she's identified
yeah yeah she has a like a clipboard and
the doctor comes in and goes we have a
we have a code blue
we need what do we need nurse and she
goes well we need
this this this bring out the crash card
bring out five cc's of of something
something
like medical terms that she learned from
being an actress on medical procedural
tv shows sure and then the doctor goes
i believe that you are indeed a real
nurse come on
and then she cuts the corner and goes
the other way yep and then the camera
follows the doctor and then we hear like
a flatline sound
where did the mirrors go with the crash
cart we lost the patient
and then they come around the corner
right the doctor is running yeah and he
has like five other like nurses and
security that that woman's a fake nurse
get her and then and then there's an old
lady with like walker and the old lady
hits the elevator button going up
and then she goes like this
guy's mopping the floor
and then she goes like this and slides
you know like a quarterback slides they
don't want to get tackled and she slides
right into the elevator as it closes
just as it
closes yeah that's great that's a great
sequence yeah that's my favorite scene
in the movie that was a good scene um
and it really really rounded out her
character and gave her a little
something to do
that was a terrible but uh so back to
the plot madison has a they had she had
cuatro
attached to her back he had a little
puppet arms yeah and a big head
before face a garbage pail kid stuck to
the back
and
they said let's cut all of its arms off
and its whole body and we'll get as much
of the face but it shares the brain so
it showed back in the head and fused the
skull
guato controls her
but
it's a twofer
cuatro is both a malignant parasitic
monster attached to her brain and or
back
but
could also be the devil
now answer me this
she says many times he's the devil
i just interpret that as her just saying
that he's evil why does a conjoined twin
have electrical powers that was the one
thing i that is never explained
i don't know
he can control like he he his voice
comes out through radios and cell phones
and [ __ ]
and he can shut lights off yeah the
power fluctuates when he's nearby the
the street lamps turn off at one point
he makes all the lamps uh light bulbs in
the interrogation room explode so i
don't know why he can do that i guess
he's paranormal
paranormal yeah
a paranormally conjoined
malignant demonic twin right
it's for convenience sake so let's see
he could communicate that's the only
yeah what else do you do and spooky so
he could be a demon or the devil
that is attached to her back and or
brain i didn't notice uh because when
her husband's still alive before he
kills the husband
those like channels are flipping through
on the tv
and when it flips to another channel
it's like static like
and that's not how tvs have been for
decades now right but static is creepy
so that's why you have to keep around
those old-timey radios so you get static
from those everybody's very static
everyone has a radio an old-timey radio
nobody uses radios anymore nope but uh
but the tv i noticed specifically or is
like you gotta have that static because
it's scary and modern tv glitching is
not scary
that vhs glitch it even appeared on the
phone
like the eye yeah yeah yeah why does the
iphone have static on it
because paranormal because paranormal is
paranormal
because they couldn't figure out a way
for
a conjoined twin to communicate
other than
uh
via paranormal magic how would one do
this if this were a schlock 70s or 80s
horror film right i don't know well i
would think if you just want to for
simplicity's sake or because it doesn't
make any sense the whole communicating
through electricity thing just have like
him communicating through her and
they're wondering if she's possessed or
something like that or yeah something
like that not bipolar multiple
personality but i guess they want to try
and make it seem like the killer is a
completely separate person so that's why
they do that right
and that's the silliest uh
concept
in the movie
it's it's it's laughable well there's a
chase halfway through
the cop starts chasing the killer and
there's a couple parts where you see the
chase happen you see the killer like
whereas like the heads on backwards like
there's a few shots and that's supposed
to be like the little clue of what's
going on
and so as someone who has watched many
many terrible b movies and loves that
schlock i was like oh so it's growing
out of the back of her head
but then i thought there was no way that
a a multi-million dollar warner brothers
movie was going to do that but then they
did that
yeah but uh so the mission of
uh
quatto bagool what do you want to call
him i guess we'll call him gabriel
gabriel let's call him gabriel let's be
respectful of the material
gabriel um gabriel wants revenge on the
doctors who cut him off her back a
basket case yes uh and so first of all
is the main doctor lady
and he goes and gets her and our hero
emily slash madison
uh can
psychically see
these events unfold well that's what
we're led to believe that's what we're
supposed to believe while it's happening
right that's what happens on screen but
really she's physically there she's just
put under a trance yeah
gabriel makes her suppressed yeah yes um
and so then uh
there's the the the older fat guy
who hasn't aged
a day in 30 years
uh he lives in a little apartment on the
top floor he gets killed i don't
remember specifically what he says but
he's in that opening scene yeah they're
running down the hallways he said
something that made me laugh
oh my god
he speaks
he's broadcasting his thoughts
i don't remember what it was but he just
says it's so serious everyone says
everything so seriously throughout the
whole movie that's hilarious so many
funny lines yeah um but that scene in
particular in his little loft was that
was the most like italian jello
you see the uh the killer black love
killer that's right out of those italian
movies and the uh
fashioned a weapon out of the first
doctor's
award i guess
and so it's like unique killing device
and there's red light shining in from
neon across the hallway it's all so
well done
technically
for such nonsense it's great well i mean
yeah there are many hallmarks that
clearly indicate that it is
a homage oh yeah uh
but the real question is was it
a successful
homage uh or was it intended to be funny
was it a parody see i i don't get the
impression they were ever trying to
actually be scary
i mean by the time you get to the third
act like there's no way anyone
could be scared by any of those
so like you do the slow setup where it
looks like a real movie it acts like a
like a conjuring movie and then you
slowly introduce the nonsense
yeah i mean i i'm not not uh not a
parody so much as just tongue-in-cheek
just having them say like ridiculous
lines completely straight-faced
yeah the best the best one is at the end
when
in in the mental prison she blocks away
the
really yeah she's so intense she's like
we share the same brain
and it's like through the bar and he's
like i'll be back yeah yeah this is like
next time i'll be ready for you right
right it's so amazing you'll always be
stuck with me but next time
i'll be ready for you
i mean and then a lot of the like
the likes
the kung fu fights and then running
through the the seattle underground
which we should talk about yeah that was
underused the set piece where uh the
detective is chasing the ghoul through
the seattle underground i mean it felt
like i was watching like a marvel movie
or an avengers or a
matrix or something it didn't feel like
a horror movie i don't know well that's
that's where we don't know who it is at
first but bagool is stalking someone and
this woman's a tour guide for what's a
real thing which is the underground city
underground i didn't see how that was a
real thing i knew it was a real thing i
don't remember where i heard about it
originally but i've always been amazed
that it wasn't used more for a spooky
horror movie it seems like such a great
setting it's it's it's a super cool
thing i never heard of it there's one of
the do you know who have you ever heard
of cold check
the night stalkers like a tv series in
the 70s but it started as a couple made
for tv movies one of them was set in
seattle and it used that
i i wish there was more of it in this
movie it seems like kind of a waste yeah
i mean i got a the set piece where the
detectives chasing bagool they're like
old carriages and like i'm like that's
probably not all still down there it
looks like something that'd be at like
the milwaukee public museum like when
you walk down those fake city streets
left all the the horse and buggy
carriages all over the place
i'm like oh this neat concept is so
smoky for no reason and it looked very
like
like a cheap low budget horror movie
which i think was their intention i
don't know but yeah so just out of
nowhere we cut we just like randomly cut
to just a character yes who's doing a
tour they're not established right yeah
and um
and then she gets kidnapped by the
monster gabriel and strung up in what
appears to be an addict
and so we i'm like well where's this
attic i don't care and then yeah he
leaves and we keep cutting back to her
trying to escape and then that's a big
twist
later on
is that uh
she escapes but she falls through the
the floor
and lands at the living room yeah it
turns out oh it was the attic of our
main character the whole time yeah
well is is is this evil creature gabriel
trying to frame our our heroine
or is she really the monster that's uh
then that brings up that question but i
have a bigger question
how did she fall from the attic down to
the living room
they pan up once right in the living
room shot and they're like panning
around and the ceilings are like 40 feet
high
of what clearly is a two-story old-timey
house yeah and those houses had low
ceilings yes and uh
seven foot ceilings sure even eight foot
ceilings even eight foot ceilings um not
not 25 feet goes up so she she falls
through the attic
with enough force to break through all
the wooden beams yes
that house must really have a termite
problem
there's a lot of velocity going on yeah
she had a whole lot of velocity yeah
right it was like she just came from
skydiving but she fell two feet and went
to
two floors of this lady's house
somehow
what
what
is it listed as a horror comedy on hbo
i'm wondering i think it's just horror
and i mean you look at the poster and
it's from the director of the conjuring
right it looks like one of his
generico horror movies and i'm picturing
because it did come out in theaters too
it's like people going to see this
opening weekend expecting another
conjuring movie
now from a studio marketing perspective
even even a director with a pedigree of
of successful and quality horror films
you know
financially i should say you know
whether or not you think his horror
movies are scary
whatever but uh certainly a successful
horror director
when one makes this
and hbo markets it as
horror cuts a trailer that makes it look
like spooky conjuring movie america's
top critics are raving about malignant
oh god it's jaw-dropping
scary as hell
it must be seen to be believed
and that says here
you know winces
or do you say
you cut the trailer differently and then
insert like like
critical reviews
wacky
a lot of blow your mind crazy horror
comedy from james want like do you do
you let people in a little bit on the
fact that it's goofier movie than the
country as opposed to a prank this is a
prank it feels like it yeah if that was
james wan's intention i'm gonna make a
movie that
people think is going to be spooky but
then turns into a comedy halfway through
and and i'm not going to tell hbo i'm
doing that and i'm just going to have a
laugh reading all the comments
if that was his intention he pulled it
off
perfectly yeah if his intention
was to create
to transform
that sort of like
uh uh genre
what would you call it italian
italian horror yeah there's some italian
i mean by the end it's more like yeah
like
frank cannon lottery troma schloss
yeah schlock we'll just say schlock if
your intention was to take a schlocky
concept
and transform it into a modern day
horror film that people take seriously
big fail what did you do to my sister
she's not your sister
it's hard for me to look at anything in
that ending and think he didn't know
it's really difficult for me to believe
based on his track record of making you
know competent and directing actors and
directing actors i mean the acting is is
so bad but
it's a like a chicken and neg kind of
thing yeah i mean we've seen his other
movies he can get fine performances out
of actors yeah but that's with with
quality dialogue is the dialogue bad or
the actors bad
it's hard to tell um
it's a little bit of both i think i
think the dialogue is goofy and it's
delivered by actors that were told to
say it completely straight
intention intention intent
and purpose is the big mystery here yeah
it's it's really baffling and it's
almost like he's
he's
uh
throwing his career mike aquaman made a
billion dollars okay he can do what he
wants yeah oh his career is not over but
i mean
let me not say career let me say uh
reputation
in terms of horror yeah well i think
it's it's one of those things where it's
like he probably knew
once you do this you can never do this
again uh yeah maybe
maybe he got is just kind of tired of
that genre uh like this the the
the demonic kind of paranormal
conjuring universe he's just kind of
tired of it i mean he should be directed
he didn't direct the third conjuring
movie right so but you always his name
has been thrown on so many things
producer james won
so there's a bit of a
a brand there with his name and
associated with like
creepy
movies that big studio horror movies
where you can just from james wan from
james one and after this i don't know if
you could do that anymore it's like it's
like m night with with his name sure
like when it started to lose its luster
after a while after so many failures but
after this i won't trust james wan ever
again i i will if he makes another move
i'm gonna be there opening night oh yeah
whatever he does next
and was that his intent that's that's
like intention number five of 12. it's
like this to me as far as like i don't
know i i this is [ __ ] you to the genre
my my respect for him has gone up
dramatically because of this movie
unless i see an interview where he's
just completely serious and he
didn't realize what he made which
may be the case i don't know but it
feels to me like this is a gopher bro
kind of thing yeah um so yeah i i am way
more interested in whatever he does next
now because of this right
yeah and that's the fascinating part of
you don't see a filmmaker
do this sort of thing you don't see a
studio movie like this right you know
intentional or not it's crazy that this
is a warner brothers movie and that that
alone makes it unique yeah i think i
said in the beginning if you have hbo
max uh watch malignant or watch in a
theater go on go on like a friday night
or saturday night if there's any reason
to go back to theaters it's this this
would be it
um
make sure it's on a weekend night oh
yeah yeah watch it with a crowd because
i would love to be in a big crowd
watching this who who know nothing about
it and
you know james wan is in the back row in
a trench coat
sunglasses just laughing
filming it for his uh for his instagram
or whatever
while giggling while the audience laughs
hysterically at the reveal of the back
monster
i mean it's just it's genius um
yeah so uh if you have hbo max watch it
on that just just as a morbid curiosity
sure or go to the [ __ ] theater and
watch it with a crowd it's this is
something different oh yeah it's a this
is enigmatic it's special movie of the
year
movie of the year says j bauman i do i
do wow
i say moopy of the year these are these
are our pull quotes
malignant ritadar september 10th just
sit back and enjoy it it's terrible uh
and or great terrible and or great it's
a it's a conundrum
it's it's it's enigmatic it's a mystery
it's it's it's baffling
uh and fascinating yeah i i have i have
uh
i have so many words to describe it jay
but uh it's it's something something uh
something we came back to the vcr repair
shop
