About a year-and-a-half late.
We had to order parts.

You ever fix that VCR?
It's complicated.
But we made a lot of money, and that's what's important.
Listen, guys.
Um, there's been some changes in the industry since you've been gone.
Yeah, we've noticed.
VCR repairman are being murdered.
Shops are getting blowed up and burned down.

an arrangement to secure the prosperity
of lightning-fast VCR repair for years

Sheila came in Oh J have you been
watching the Olympics I've never really
been a fan of the Olympics

is on you know just to squeeze a couple
out I hear you buddy
my role in all of this was to convince
certain people to move forward with
technology to give up their VCRs and VHS
tapes and embrace the future so I had to
seduce them most of them were elderly
men like mr. blinken but some of them
were elderly women too can't decide if
that's hot or not believe me it wasn't
pretty but I did get paid very well to
sleep with over 11 million elderly
people we destroyed a lot of VCRs didn't

we sure did I also had my boys at ILM
develop a little piece of technology I
like to call the magnetron expect to
audre fire no it sends out
electromagnetic waves that instantly
erased VHS tapes even destroys the
playing heads of VCRs within a certain
range I pointed at them but I have to be
very precise with the aim because the
love of God which you shut the fuck up

Wars known to exist what as you can see
