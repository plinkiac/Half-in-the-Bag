Half in the bag.
i am bill s. preston esquire
i am ted theodore logan
and together we are Wyld Stallyns
well mike
i'm done boarding up all the doors and windows
what
what happened now
everything
hey what are you watching
oh it's the new bill and ted movie: bill and ted face the music
that's not the new movie
that's the embarrassing bill and ted tv series from 1992
oh
i was wondering why keanu reeves and alex winter look so different
here i'll i'll put on the new movie
oh good
dude
yeah
the future
yeah
oh my god
why do keanu reeves and alex winter look so different
well i mean it has been 30 years since the last bill and ted movie
what
no it's been
oh
i think my watch stopped working
if it isn't the Wyld Stallyns
bill and ted face the music
they didn't totally fuck it up
i'm sorry
what
that's a hell of an intro
and that's probably an accurate statement
they didn't fuck it up
they didn't totally fuck it up
it's a bill and ted movie
we talked about in our review
like you kind of have to have lower expectations
this isn't a star wars movie or you know some big franchise
oh you could you could take this movie if this were like like like a serious science fiction movie like even not even not even a full-on like drama series but like even up the level of back to the future you could you could pick this so full of holes
that's all the bill and ted movies
there there is there is no kind of like internal logic for for time travel
yeah
for the afterlife for for whatever the hell the problem bill and ted need to solve is which i don't even understand that at all
yeah
but bill and ted are goof-a-balls
they walk around
they're dumb
that's the thing is like things that would be a detriment to other movies are just sort of a charm of the bill and ted movies
and this movie for the most part has all the same like positive qualities as the other movies and the same negative qualities as the other movies
yeah
yeah
it's another bill and ted movie
and that you know it's an okay movie and that's sometimes okay is good enough
yeah
especially right now
oh god this feels so out of place right now
this is i don't i don't know if the message of everyone let's all just get along
i don't think that flies in 2020
it's you know what when they call movies escapism this is the best example of that because it was so nice to just watch a a goofy movie about people saving the earth with positivity
for those 90 minutes or for those hour and 20 minutes
that shocked me too
that shocked me too
i looked at the i noticed the running time at some point it was only an hour and a half
yeah
standard well not you know when we were young standard fucking movie length
but now it's like two hours and 48 minutes
i don't want to see a two and a half hour building type movie and they know that
i i don't i i wonder if there's not just stuff that was cut out though
that's the one thing i noticed about the
movie is a lot of it feels kind of rushed
yeah
it feels rushed and there's too many subplots like one once again
the the the princesses are completely worthless characters that don't do anything
but they get their own subplot this time for some reason
it feels like a subplot that has been deleted
yes
every once while they show up in the movie and you're like oh yeah they're doing something
their older selves have kidnapped them for some reason
yeah
we won't get into spoilers yet but there is kind of a revelation of what was happening at the end it's just like one line of dialogue
just explain away what was happening
it feels so half-assed
yeah
yeah
the other thing the other thing that that that's out just for me personally about this movie is the keanu reeves has completely gotten over the hump for me
here's here's my history with keanu reeves
oh okay
for like decades keanu reeves was that dumb guy
he was the woe dude guy
he was the woe do guy
i would see like speed in the theater i saw speed in theater i'm like i can't buy him as an action
hero he's that dumb guy
i saw the matrix and i can't buy him as the chosen one
he's that dumb guy
hmm
and now now here we finally are we've had our john wicks and our constantines and we finally got to the point where i watch bill and ted face the music and i'm like why is keanu reeves playing this idiot
see i watched it i was like why isn't he that dumb guy
because that's overall i i enjoyed the movie
yeah
it's complete nonsense which is fun for for
for a 90 minute movie bill and ted it's nice to see them back together
it was nice to see alex winter again because he's not even an actor anymore
he's probably the best one in the movie
well that's that's what i wanted to mention
the the unfortunate weakest part of the entire movie of the bill and ted movie is half of bill and ted
uh keanu reeves i don't know what is going on with him
he looks like he's on like pain meds
i'm sorry
what
see i just assumed my assumption when i watched it was just that i had finally gotten used to action and drama star keanu reeves
yeah
and i was having a hard time buying him back in his old dumb role but maybe i i can't say he half-assed it
because it's not like it's not like he's hurting for money and he needed to do the bill and ted movie
yeah no
and that's that's the nice thing about this movie is that it doesn't feel it feels so not cynical
so you have the two writers who wrote all the other movies
you have alex winter and keanu reeves uh and they all came back to make this movie
it was something they've been trying to get made for like 10 years
which is rare because so many movies now it's like 80s nostalgia dig it back up and make a new movie
but nobody wanted to make this movie
but it was like a passion of project of theirs because they all just like each other and they like playing bill and ted
so now it took like 10 years to get made and it's relatively low budget
which shows
which we could talk about some of the visuals in the film
but it feels like keanu reeves is not he's not that guy anymore
he's not the woe dude guy anymore you
look at bill and ted's excellent adventure or like do you remember the movie parenthood
that is one messed up little dude
it's the same type of role
it's it's keanu reeves
it's whoa dude keanu reeves
and when you watch those movies you're like that's him
but he's not that guy anymore and he hasn't been for a long time
no he's he's the cool dude now
he well i'm not just talking about the roles he plays
but when you see him in interviews and stuff he's so just like kind of stoic and zen-like and calm
and i feel like he's just so far removed from that that he can't he can't embrace his inner ted anymore
i don't i don't think it's in him physically
because he looks like he's struggling to smile the few times that he smiles in this movie and it's very odd
i should i should remove the dude part of that because these days he is just cool
yeah
or well he's the woe guy because of the matrix
i think a lot of people see him as the john wick guy now
now he's john wick
yeah
and that's the other thing is like nobody needed to make this movie
like alex winter isn't even an actor anymore
the writers have done other big things
and keanu reeves definitely doesn't need to do this because he's got john wick money
that's why i can't imagine he just phoned it in
no he didn't
i just think he's not that person anymore
yeah
and he can't channel that
and he has lots of lines in the movie where i'm i'm picturing them from like the writer's standpoint where when they were writing it i can see them picturing keanu reeves as ted saying that line and how he would say that line
but then the way he delivers a lot of those lines in the movie are so different than what you would think
party on dudes
party on dudes
yeah
like when they first get into the phone booth and they're about to travel through time he says something like it's similar to the line in the first movies like i think we're about to embark on a most excellent adventure
bill my friend
yes ted my friend
this has been a most excellent adventure
and he's so like excited and optimistic about it and this one it sounds like it's a struggle for him to get the words out
bill my friend
yes ted my friend
i have a feeling things are about to change in a most outstanding way
and then you have on the other hand you have alex winter who's carrying the movie on his fucking back
he looks like he's having a blast
he hasn't he hasn't missed a beat
no
for someone that hasn't acted in like 20 years because he's a director now he makes documentaries and shit
and i think he's done some like animated voice over work yeah
yeah
but this is his first big acting thing i think since his movie freaked
see i haven't been following him
that's the last thing i remember seeing a man was freaked
yeah and then he kind of went behind the camera
but the whole dynamic the bill and ted dynamic is thrown off because you have uh alex winter acting to be fair like an older version which is good that they're not just trying to do their teenage whoa dude stuff
mmhmm
they feel like older versions of those characters
uh alex winter does
but keanu reeves is like you can't quite get there
how's it going dude
yeah dude
i think i think maybe if they'd they'd played that up like like the character himself is older now and and ted is having a hard time being that younger version of himself but he knows he has to to make the song but he's he's lost the mojo
yeah
they could have done something like that
they kind of do
there's a couple moments like early on they're in the garage and he tells bill that he's thinking about selling his guitar
it's like moments like that kind of work
yeah
because what when we talked about we did uh there's outtakes from our bill and ted review that are on our patreon because we have patreon
and we talk about that we talk about like how you can't just have them we compared it to like the dumb and dumber sequel
well you know the first one came out in the 90s there's a dumb and dumber sequel a couple of years ago
and it's not only unfunny it's creepy
when you have these people that were acting like imbeciles in their 30s but now they're like 60
and they act exactly the same they live in the same place they're wearing the same clothes
it's it's not funny
it's pathetic
as as a counterpoint though i'm gonna throw out ash from ash versus evil dead
well he's devolved
he starts in the first evil dead movie he's like just a normal college guy
and then he gets dumber and more abrasive as the series go he has like the opposite of an arc
so that's for comedic purposes and that's fine
yeah
but uh yeah it's it's you know i do like that they are older in this
they don't try and just act like oh they're still just bill and ted
and that's the stuff that worked
okay they acknowledge that they're older they introduced the daughters who i liked a lot who are just little bill and ted's
and they kind of give the movie that that kind of youthful energy of the original movies
yeah
who are themselves
they're just doing a bill and ted impression
the daughters
they're doing pretty damn good ones though especially ted's daughter
that actress i know the bill's daughters samara weaving
it was i don't know if you saw it ready or not that came out last year
no
she's good in that
she's been good in everything i've seen her
i'm familiar with the other one who's a character in uh netflix's atypical
it's a dramedy
yeah
she's great in that
okay
see she's the one i wasn't familiar with so watching this movie i had no idea who she was
yeah
and it's like she's like the reincarnation of young keanu reeves
keanu reeves isn't even dead but somehow she's been reincarnated because she is like pitch perfect
yeah yeah
and that idea too of having because there's a lot of ways you could go with it where it's like oh they have daughters and their daughters are embarrassed by them and they don't do that
they're just little bill and ted's and that's like perfect for the the vibe of these movies
the cutest thing in the world is that they refer to bill and ted both of them as dads
yeah
this this movie perfectly captures that same kind of energy of the other movies
yeah
if i criticize anything with with the daughters they should have done something just more with them story-wise as it relates to bill and ted
like some kind of like some kind of arc you can make out of that like some kind of disconnect or bill and ted are worried about their daughters for this
just some some emotional thing that ties up at the end
because i'm thinking bill and ted they go to the marriage counselor with the princesses
yeah
and bill and ted's quest is kind of related to oh no we're gonna lose our wives
yes
and then the princesses leave the movie
i i think the thing that sent them on their journey it shouldn't have been the oh we're going to lose our wives it should have been oh we're having trouble connecting with our daughters or something
just just that relationship between them is just more focused on in the movie
maybe
i guess it depends on what they did with it
i kind of like that they all are just supportive of each other and love each other and there's no drama
because as when we talked about the first two movies that's a big thing with them is we talk about like especially in the first movie all those those typical elements you would put in like a teen comedy just aren't there
all the the stock like they don't get picked on at school
none of that's there and that's what kind of makes them special as characters
and so i kind of like that that bleeds over into the daughters where it's just they're not you know oh we gotta make sure our daughters turn out better than us
like we gotta we gotta push them to go to college or something like that
right right
it's like no their daughters love music and they are supportive of their daughter's love of music against like ted's dad's wishes or his his uh opinion of him
he's like your daughters are going to turn out to be as big of losers as you
yeah
so it's like they're all in it together it's like a group
it's it's wholesome and that's that's pleasant in this day and age that's what you're getting at
yes
i mean that's this whole fucking movie
how you doing
well you know dead
and we're in hell
but how you doing
we're good
i was wondering how they were going to retcon the ending of bogus journey
and i was i was surprised that for the most part they didn't
no
and i remember i think it's on the commentary track for bogus journey they talk about that
because there's all those like magazine covers and newspaper headlines and that was not the writers
that was like in post-production
like whoever did the end titles just added those because they thought it'd be cute and funny
and they're like this completely fucks up our ideas for the third movie
so we got to figure out how to work this in
okay
so they did what they they had to do and it works fairly well
yeah yeah
and especially with the idea of like bill and ted you know in the first movie they're like 80s hair metal guys
and there's so many of those type of acts that were like huge plain arenas in the 80s and now they're like playing you know county fairs
yeah
so that that rise and quick fall completely works
without it getting too you know dour
yeah, yeah
just just the right amount of melancholy at the beginning of the movie
well they're also not in like a completely miserable place in their
lives when the movie starts either like
you could go the you can go the once
again ash versus evil dead he's living
in a trailer route you know but oh my
god they got nice homes
right next to each other right next to
each other you know
they don't look like they're hurting
they're because they're like constantly
the whole idea
that's in the trailers that you see in
the movie is that they haven't written
the song that unites the world yet and
it's like what do you do if that's
that's your destiny and you're middle
age now and it still hasn't happened
so like they're performing at the
wedding and they're doing this this like
bizarre experimental song with this
really pretentious title
they're just like trying anything
they're utterly desperate
yes they've been they have been crushed
under the weight of
expectations that nobody should ever
have
yeah nobody should ever have somebody
walk into their room and just say
you're gonna save the universe someday
figure it out
yeah and now you still haven't done it
that song by the way though i think that
song it's kind of good
it's all over the place because i tried
all these different instruments which is
funny but
you can't do the joke that they're bad
musicians anymore because they're not
so it's like oh what do they do try
anything
it reminded me of maybe it was
influenced by do you know anything about
brian wilson from the beach boys no in
the 60s he had like a complete mental
breakdown
and was obsessed with writing like the
perfect album
and so he would just like lock himself
in a recording studio and try all these
different
he'd bring in all these different
musicians and try all these different
weird
sounds as like not instruments but he
would try and use like
dogs barking and like coke cans and just all this crazy shit
hyper experimental
yeah he got really experimental because
he was just trying to write like the
perfect song
so i don't know if this was influenced
by that but it reminded me of it it
feels like it's probably
and that's how we got jingle cats
i'm sorry what
but the universe they were told they
were gonna bring together was actually
starting to unravel
time was folding in on itself when is
time going on the fritz because it seems
to be happening
every when at once it's very weird
the crisis yeah i mean i think it's the
idea that all space and time are
connected i don't know and we're all
connected because
music yeah something it's
and the ti and the uh the phone booth
can also travel to
parallel dimensions i guess i don't
think it does that's what the princesses
do
oh yeah that's right yeah they go to
alternate realities to find
the uh uh one where they can be happy
with build and test i forgot they were
going to different realities because we
never follow them on their we never see
that i don't know if that's something
that was like
because the movie does feel overstuffed
for the short run time that it has so i
don't know if there was more that
got cut because of budget reasons or
whatever i have to assume there was a
whole subplot
and then they were looking at their
budget and they're thinking well
it's the princesses it's almost comical
at this point
three movies in it's almost comical how
useless the princess characters are
they have the funny scene early on when
they're doing couples therapy as a
couple yeah and there's some funny bits
in that
and then like that's all you need for
the movie establish their relationship
is on the rocks because they haven't
you know fulfilled their destiny or
whatever and then get them out of the
movie
one of my first big laugh out loud
moments was an unintentional laugh early
on
they you know they perform their song at
the wedding and then
ted's dad is like bitching him out where
he's like he didn't travel through time
he didn't go to heaven and hell blah
blah blah
bill ted enough of the delusions you
didn't time travel
and you didn't go to heaven and hell
he's like your daughters are turning out
to be big losers too the only ones in
your family that are responsible or no
he says because then the princesses walk
up and he's like
uh joanna elizabeth how do you feel to
be the only ones responsible in your
entire family how do you feel
about being the only adults in your
families the only ones with
actual jobs is back up
and then they don't even answer and he
turns around and walks away and then
they just don't say anything
i was like that epitomizes the princess characters
they're completely fucking useless and don't contribute anything
the movie is a little bit of a mess when
it comes to just like the overall what
what what are they trying to say
but well i think they're just trying to
cram too much stuff in yeah because you
have the main
the main plot of them traveling through
time to try and find the song
you have the daughter subplot which is
like a mini reboot of the first movie
complete reboot where they're yeah
finding historical this time they're
finding
historical famous musicians which is
some fun stuff
but it is basically a remake of the
first movie um
and then you have the princess's
storyline
and then we have well it's kind of in
there
they show up every once in a while just
for bill and ted to say go away again
but i mean just the concept of the bill
and ted versus themselves
which is kind of their problem they're
they're fighting themselves because they
they don't know how to make the song
they kind of are their own enemy and
it's both both internal
and because of time travel also external
they are their own enemies
yeah i enjoyed that that's that's your
concept yeah and that's
enough for a movie but i think they
didn't want it to just be another bill
and ted adventure
you know kind of spread it out a little
bit yeah which would be worse if the
other subplots were terrible but they
aren't like i
like i said i like the daughters they're
fun the part when jimi hendrix is
jamming out to mozart
is fun i i like i like the daughters i
just i
i thought their subfloor their subplart
the daughters i just thought their
subplart was a little weak
dude our dads are totally in trouble
you should help them out
because because it was just a complete
rehash of the first bill and ted movie
it was we're gonna we're gonna kidnap
these historical figures okay
the guy playing louis armstrong was
pretty good though yeah he didn't have
enough to do but
he was just that right level of he's
like louis armstrong but they cranked it
up just enough to be kind of funny
but then the other subplots we have
rufus's daughter played by kristen shaw
which is weird i know george carlin was
a comedy person but he plays his role in
those movies pretty straight yeah so
it's weird to have like a goofy comedy
person playing his daughter
but i did like her character's name is
kelly which is george carlin's real
daughter's name wondering if they didn't
just get his real daughter at first when
i first started watching because i don't
know what she looks like yeah no but
yeah
her name in real life is kelly so it's
like oh it's a nice little little
tribute to george carlin the late great
george garland
but we also meet her mom who is now
the the great leader in the future and
she
decides that maybe
they need to kill bill and ted instead
of let him write a scenario see okay
this is this is where it gets into the
territory where
if you if you worry about the details
and you try to break it down
it completely falls apart sure because
everything happened in the past and they
seem to have been really familiar with
bill and ted in the previous movies
shouldn't they know exactly what
happened
in this movie they kind of retcon it
where it's like oh rufus kept saying
this was gonna happen yeah
i mean it's yeah again it's fine because
it's bill and ted
but it's it's a it's a weird subplot in
a movie that's already filled with
subplots and it seems to only be there
as an excuse to bring in this robot
character
didn't work for me the robot character i
get i got what the
joke was well the joke is he serves the
exact same function as the grim reaper
in part two
starts as an imposing figure that wants
to take them to the afterlife
and then gets increasingly more and more
silly how are we gonna find them dude i
don't know
dude yeah i don't even know dude the
the i don't i didn't know who that guy
was i looked him up he's on the show
barry the hbo series barry which i
haven't watched but
his he's funny his performance is funny
but it does
feel like reheated leftovers from build
testbook story
also i want to know because bill and ted
i guess for i guess we're
spoilers full-on spoilers they keep
traveling further and further forward in
time you know
trying to get the song from their older
selves and eventually
they're like 40 37 years in the future
and they
they die but their daughters died 37
years ago
have their daughters been in hell 37
years
because when they meet the daughters in
hell the daughters are acting like they
just got there that's true it's all it's
all connected rich space and time we're
all connected
is it just because space and time is
breaking down it's cause facing time is
breaking down rich
okay well another question is why do
they go to hell what they ever do
hell is used as more of like a plot
convenience than anything else in this
where it's like that's a place where all
of our characters can meet up bill and
ted can reunite with death
and then death can bring them all back
together up to earth at the same time in
the same place
which that was actually another big
laugh out of me was when they're in hell
and they're about to leave it cuts to
because earlier we see the robot kill
ted's dad
he vaporizes him with his laser so his
dad's in hell but then
for absolutely no reason his swat van is
also in hell
because it also got vaporized vaporized
that's the kind of like complete
nonsense that i wish the movie leaned
into more
the funny part to me was in in hell
apparently the souls that die and go to
hell they're just falling into hell
i like that too yeah and on their way
out the police fed just keeps hitting
souls damn souls that are on their way
to hell yeah yeah you hear them like
when they're in the van you hear them
like smacking on the side of it
i don't know if this i know that the
movie like a lot of the post-production
took place
after kind of the covet lockdown stuff
started to happen
so a lot of it was done remotely i did
notice some
weird editing awkward editing like the
part when they go to the uh
the future i think it's like five years
in the future when they're in the
mansion
and they're like the fopish british
versions of themselves which was fun to
see
keanu reeves try and fail again to do a
british accent
he pulled that out from bram stoker's
dracula it didn't work then it doesn't
work now
i've seen many strange things already
bloody wolves chasing me through some
blue inferno
oh god i forgot he was in that yeah
everybody i guess he was online
but there's there's some really weird
like there's uh
and this happens sometimes in movies if
there's a super wide shot
and someone's talking you might notice
since they're so small it's hard to
notice but
like their mouth doesn't match what
they're saying yeah but this is just
like
a standard two shot is it unlike those
sad open mic
blokes from three years ago we are now
finally able to muster
some compassion and then later in that
scene they're sitting across from each
other at that table
the future bill and ted ted like
towards the end of the shot he starts to
talk but his dialogue isn't there and
then it cuts to the reverse
of contemporary bill and ted and they
start talking
honestly i wouldn't have thought we had
it in us so it's like they just used to
take where he started talking but they
didn't use his audio it was really weird
it was really clunky jay
i've i've seen ryan's babe it can get a
lot worse that's true
i'll have another one jim no more today
bill please escort this gentleman to the
door
well speaking of the low budgets uh and
this isn't necessarily something related
to a low budget but
in in specifically in this case i
noticed it they travel to the future
and i hate in movies when they clearly
shot
their actors completely in front of a
green screen and the entire
background is like a digital background
yeah a digital set
and in this movie they go to the future
and this happens i noticed this in like
marvel movies too
where their digital set their set is
like
like an arena-sized location with
nothing in it it's just this barren
place that always drives me nuts
epic but it's not epic it's boring
somebody thinks it's epic in this movie
you can chalk it up to the low budget
they didn't have time to add lots of
details and stuff but it's like they
travel to the future they're walking down this this fucking 20 mile long bridge that has nothing on it on either side
but the phone booth the original movie phone booth is there right in the center of the bridge
yeah
just like uh like a display because then we have a uh like a hologram rufus come out and be like this is the phone booth that i used to find the great ones
and it's like i'm picturing this on like
a real set where you have like a hallway
with all these different historical
artifacts
it's like okay that makes sense but it's
just this gigantic empty hallway that
leads to a
gigantic empty room because even if
you're just doing
a set that's entirely 3d it still
costs money to have somebody in 3d
design
all these different artifacts that are
supposed to be in some kind of
complicated setting rather than just
adds a big bridge
yeah i i miss cool production design
bill and ted's bogus journey hell looks
cool in that movie
here hell is boring
on one hand technically better but yes
less interesting yeah less interesting
yeah
yeah you see like one cave that kind of
looks like a face i think and that's
like it there's some demons flying
around and there's some hot rocks
yeah but they're well-rendered hot rocks
at times when i was watching this i i
got a
a distinct vibe of tv movie yes
and i'm i'm wondering because
coronavirus has been going on for
a while now and they've probably known
that
this wasn't going to end up in theaters
for a while now so i wonder if at some
point
after the call was made that this is
going straight to streaming
if they didn't just yeah we don't we
don't need special effects that fancy
i think the movie was mostly done before
the decision was made but like
streaming the effects and everything
yeah yeah okay i'm pretty sure it was
almost completely done
um but i'm sure i mean it's all about
money i'm sure they were wagering
they were all looking at the numbers
like what do we stand to gain if we
push this hold this movie off and
release it when theaters reopen oh it's
probably not going to do very well
anyway
so we'll put it on streaming well plus
the risk you run in like a year from now
is we're going to have all of next
year's movies and all of this year's
movies
all coming out at once yes so they're
probably also afraid of just comp
competition yeah yeah it's all i mean
it's like you know
christopher nolan can tell the studio no
my movie's going to wait for theaters
because he has that power and he's a big
you know his movies are all
it's about the epic of seeing it in the
theater the epicness of scene
on the big screen this movie you don't
really need to see it on the big screen
i'm sorry what
you know you know this movie needed some
kind of epilogue
yes that's what i wanted to mention i
guess we're well into spoilers now
yeah
this movie just fucking ends
i don't well because because the eternal logic of the problem and everything breaks down so easily they probably didn't understand what was happening in the movie well enough to write an aftermath
i don't even think it's that
i think it's like this is presumably the last time we will see a bill in ted movie
i would guess
i mean especially now that it's releasing on it is in some theaters
but it's still mostly vod
it's probably not going to make a lot of
money if it was just released in a
normal year
a theatrical year it probably still
wouldn't make a lot of money because
comedies just don't do well
yeah and this is a weird movie that
probably would not make a lot of money
anyway
but so this is presumably the last time
we'll see them you do need some kind of
epilogue with bill and ted
there's i don't know if you stayed till
after the credits there's a post-credit
scene
with them as elderly bill and ted even
if that was the last scene of the movie
i would be okay with that you
you needed to see bill and ted and their
daughters bill and ted
on stage performing at some kind of
higher venue concert or something
something no you got to go small because
that ending is a big concert yeah that's
that's that's the epic conclusion so
then you have something more personal
like yeah maybe they're all hanging out
in the garage or something which they're
in the garage at the end of the movie
during the garage at the beginning of
excellent adventure so it goes full
circle something like that
yeah i'm just just all the family
hanging out them realizing how much they
appreciate their family
something cute and heartwarming that
wraps up bill and ted
there's no wrap up jay there's no wrap
up they're just like we're done we're
out
because they were planning endless
sequels with the daughters
i don't know if that ever would have
happened even without coronavirus
but i think there was a thought
somewhere well maybe
yeah i don't know i i i like them in
this movie i don't know if i would like
a whole movie about them i just don't
think it would work
them as like an extension of bill and
ted is funny that they're exactly the
same as them
but them in their own movie it would
just feel like a cheap
knockoff of bill and ted yeah creatively
i think it was the wise decision to make
them daughters
because obviously at the end of bogus
journey they're like this is a little
ted this is a little bill
they cover that up with like one line of
dialogue in this so it's like there's
their cute nickname
i actually think it was a little bit
smart because if it was just
teenage boys who were just like bill and
ted
that would have been too much yes like
bill and ted yeah that's i say like
creatively that was the wise decision
it works for this movie and then also
you have like rufus's daughter so
there's this whole
father-daughter thing going on i didn't
think it was weird at the very end when
they saved the world with their music
and it cuts back to the future and we
see rufus's wife
the great leader your father would be so
proud of you
or she's like your father would have
been proud it's like she should get some
comeuppance for fucking killing
all these people what is this
did not get an apology for trying to
murder bill and ted
not trying she did murdered bill and ted
murdered their daughters that's true
murdered louis armstrong and jimmy
hendrix
she murdered over a dozen people why did
the time
disruptions disproportionately affect
babe ruth
babe ruth and george washington keep
popping into different places more so
than other people
uh because then you don't have to hire
more actors because you're on a low
budget
oh that makes sense george washington
keeps showing
be excellent to each other and party on
dudes
so we've talked about how this movie is
is a sloppy mess
but it's still kind of fun yeah because
when you go to bill and ted you go to
see bill and ted be goofballs
yes and you're you're not going for an
intricately laid out
plot that makes sense and
it'd be nice if it but didn't be nice if
it did
yeah but bogus journey is still the best
bill and ted movie
yes yes i rewatched i rewatched all of
them
like in a row because of this and well i
know you did because we did our review
on that's true because i am mike
and that movie's so fucking good
a lot i i i'm rewatching them all i'm just kind of surprised how much i always knew bill bogus journey was my favorite
it kind of surprised me how much more i like bogus journey
yeah
than excellent adventure
well it's there's a lot of there's a lot of craft put into it as far as the filmmaking goes and the
ideas are just so creative
yeah and this movie it's a little
weirder than excellent adventure but it
still feels like
a watered-down bogus journey bogus
journey was smart enough
to realize that like it it's not a time
travel series
yeah it's it's a series about these two
dumb
but good-natured guys who go on
fantastical
adventures adventures that these type of
characters should not be going on yeah
because these are goofy side characters
in a typical teen movie
and then when they got to face the music
it was like well geez did we make a time
travel movie or a supernatural
afterlife movie we'll just do both yeah
yeah it's an amalgam of the first two
movies
i i i was expecting like like hearing
about this movie and watching the
trailers what what i expected
is that the the twists would be they're
not they're not time traveling
bill and ted are going to alternate
universes
that's what i thought it was going to be
too when you see them in like in prison
and stuff
where they run into like yeah we kind of
got that but it's not really altered
versions it's just
yeah their future selves keep decorating
right
but i i expected them to be running
around with like
five different copies of bill and ted
altogether yeah
i don't know it's weird it's a weird
movie it feels like a lot of it is
hampered by the low budget
and also too many subplots it's fine
i think it probably could have been
better but it's fine
yeah it's it's a bill and ted send off
even though it really doesn't have a
proper balance head send off because we
needed to cut back to them at the end in
the aftermath
yes yes it's fine we needed an epilogue
scene and we didn't get it yeah
so now it just kind of it just stops
it's like the ending of american
werewolf in london we're just done
we're out look american werewolf in
london just needed one scene
that's all that moving needed the
transformation scene
that's that's a cool scene and
everyone's gonna remember american world
london forever that's all that movie
needed
see that's what you can do with this
movie because the thing that makes bogus
journey so great
is that it's it's a sequel to a time
travel movie that isn't about time
travel
they go in a completely different
direction and this movie needed to go in
another different direction
yes and so bill and ted as werewolves
oh god that's what you need something
completely out of left field that's what
you need to do
bill and ted for let's just make it
ourselves
we have to wait until coronavirus is
over wow
now it's not over yet
do you hear that cricket yeah i do
does that mean our joke didn't land
i've been hearing it for this entire
discussion so i think it means that
none of our jokes landed oh no
well jay now that we're done talking
about bill and ted face the music what
do you want to do now
i think we're going to be stuck in this
vcr repair shop for a long time because of corona virus
i don't know if we got nothing but time
you want to just watch bill and ted face
the music again
sure why not
how's it going dude things have
definitely been better we totally can't
rehearse
and our wild stallions matter has been
most unceremoniously reduced
no way yes way we're completely stumped
rufus
totally at odds with this dilemma
excellent
i'm already on
mike this is the embarrassing failed bill and ted tv series from 1992
again
does it matter
oh mike
nothing matters anymore
